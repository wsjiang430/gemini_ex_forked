Item 1.      Business
Our Company
We are a Houston, Texas based business. We design and manufacture specialized equipment, which combined with field technician support, last mile logistics services and our software solutions, enables us to provide a service offering that helps oil and natural gas operators and their suppliers drive efficiencies that reduce operational footprint and costs during the completion phase of well development. Our equipment and services are deployed across active oil and natural gas basins in the United States. 
We believe our continual product innovation is one of our main competitive advantages. We specialize in developing all-electric equipment that automates the low pressure section of oil and gas well completion sites. We believe all-electric equipment operates more efficiently than traditional equipment, is more reliable, safer and lowers the environmental and operating footprint required to develop oil and gas. We also believe that automation improves operational efficiency by reducing errors, waste and headcount required on well sites, which lowers costs and improves safety. 
We manage and report our operations as a single business. Our fleet has grown from consisting of our legacy mobile proppant management systems to multiple types of all-electric, automated equipment designed to efficiently store, move and blend sand and fluids on the low pressure side of well completion sites. 
The number of our mobile proppant management systems fully utilized has been our traditional measure of activity, as historically one mobile proppant management system would follow one hydraulic fracturing (frac) crew, on average. While we still use this metric as an important measure of our activity today, we have expanded our revenue sources through new technology and offerings that work in conjunction with our legacy systems, including our turnkey last mile logistics management services, our proprietary top fill equipment to enable quick unloading from bottom drop trucks, our AutoBlend™ integrated electric blender, our fluid management systems and our proprietary Solaris Lens® software.
Our Properties 
​
We own or lease various facilities including our corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas, manufacturing facility in Early, Texas and a transloading facility in Kingfisher, Oklahoma.
Suppliers
We have built long-term relationships with third-party suppliers to both transport equipment and products and provide certain materials used in the manufacturing and maintenance of our systems. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no supplier accounted for more than 10% of our total spending.
To date, we have been able to obtain the third party-trucking services necessary to support our operations on a timely basis. While we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of third-party trucking services by one or more of our suppliers, we may not always be able to do so. We do not currently have long-term agreements with third-party trucking suppliers and could experience shortages and price increases in the future.

Our Customers and Contracts
Our primary customers are major E&P and oilfield service companies. We generally execute master service agreements ("MSAs") with our customers. Generally, the MSAs govern the relationship with our customers with specific work performed under individual work orders. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Liberty Oilfield Services, LLC accounted for approximately 22% and 26%, respectively, of our total revenue.
Competition 
The oil and natural gas services industry is highly competitive. We have numerous types of competitors, including logistics companies, equipment manufacturers, hydraulic fracturing service companies and sand mining companies. Some of these companies could be customers of ours on certain jobs while also utilizing their own equipment and integrated service offerings on other jobs.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve are equipment reliability, technical expertise, patented-protected technology, unique services offerings, equipment capacity, transportation and storage, work force competency, efficiency, safety record, reputation, experience and price. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by delivering the highest-quality services and equipment possible, coupled with superior execution and operating efficiency in a safe working environment.
Seasonality
Our business is not significantly impacted by seasonality, although our business may be impacted by holidays, inclement weather, and our clients’ budget cycles, during which we may experience declines in our operating results.
For a discussion of the impact of weather on our operations, please see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Seasonal weather conditions and natural disasters could severely disrupt normal operations and harm our business.”
Human Capital
We believe that our employees are the foundation to fostering our innovative culture, the safe operation of our assets and delivery of services to our customers. We foster a collaborative and inclusive work environment, focused on working safely every day. We seek to identify qualified internal and external talent for our organization, enabling us to execute on our strategic objectives.
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 344 employees overall, who were employed pursuant to an administrative services agreement that primarily supports our operations. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to fostering a work environment in which all employees treat each other with dignity and respect and are continually striving to attract a diverse workforce. Our employee demographic profile allows us to promote inclusion of thought, skill, knowledge, and culture across our operations to achieve our social obligations, commitments and to drive enhanced decision making and execution for the business. We are proud of the diversity of our workforce and promote inclusion at all levels of our organization. As of December 31, 2022:

(1) | Females represented approximately 13% of our organization and 23% of supervisory or managerial roles.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Minorities represented 41% of our organization and 23% of supervisory or managerial roles.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Health and Safety
Safety is a core value of ours and begins with the protection of our employees. We value people above all else and remain committed to making their safety and health our top priority. To protect our employees, contractors, and 

6



surrounding community from workplace hazards and risks, we implement and maintain an integrated system of policies, practices, and controls, including requirements to complete detailed safety and regulatory compliance training on a regularly scheduled basis for all applicable individuals.
With respect to COVID-19, the safety of our employees is our top priority, and we will continue to operate in accordance with federal and state health guidelines and safety protocols. We implemented several policies and provided employee training to help maintain the health and safety of our workforce. Working remotely and under our revised policies has not impacted our ability to maintain operations or caused us to incur significant additional expenses; however, we are unable to predict the duration or ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business or operations.
Recruiting and Turnover
In order to recruit and maintain a workforce that is high-quality and diverse, we have personnel devoted to recruiting and retention, online job postings and recruiting programs, such as job fairs and other recruiting events, which we have established at academic and professional institutions for roles at all levels. 
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
Our business operations are subject to stringent federal, tribal, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety, the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection. Numerous governmental entities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions, including the incurrence of potentially significant capital or operating expenditures to mitigate or prevent releases of materials from our equipment, facilities or from customer locations where we provide products and services. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities; restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment; require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations; impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations and support services. 
The more significant of these existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations include the following U.S. legal standards, as amended from time to time:

(1) | the Clean Air Act (“CAA”), which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources and imposes various pre-construction, operational, monitoring, and reporting requirements, and that the EPA has relied upon as authority for adopting climate change regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters, including wetlands, and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the United States;
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which, among other things, subjects owners and operators of onshore facilities to liability for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill in waters of the United States;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, disposers and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), which governs the generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(6) | the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), which ensures the quality of the nation’s public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of waste fluids into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7




(7) | the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(8) | the Endangered Species Act, which restricts activities that may affect existing or previously unidentified federally listed endangered and threatened species or their habitats by the implementation of new or existing operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas; and
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(9) | the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) regulations, which relate to advancing the safe transportation of energy and hazardous materials and emergency response preparedness.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certain of these federal environmental laws such as CERCLA and the RCRA, as well as analogous state laws impose joint and several strict liability for costs required to clean up and restore properties where pollutants have been released regardless of whom may have caused the harm or whether the activity was performed in compliance with all applicable laws. States also adopt and implement their own environmental laws and regulations, which may be more stringent than federal requirements. Many of the properties owned or leased by us were previously operated by third parties whose management, disposal or release of materials and wastes was not under our control. Private parties, including the owners of properties that we lease or upon which we conduct our services for our customers as well as facilities where our materials or wastes are taken for recycling or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. We have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures, some of which may be material, to comply with environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations and such costs may have a material adverse effect on our business and operational results in the future.
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and we or our customers may be required to make significant, unanticipated capital and operating expenditures. Examples of regulatory initiatives to which we are subject to include the following: 

(1) | Hydraulic Fracturing. At the federal level, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority under the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance for such activities. Additionally, the EPA issued a final regulation under the Clean Water Act prohibiting discharges to publicly owned treatment works of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities and released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that "water cycle" activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. Notwithstanding these recent legal developments, further administrative and regulatory restrictions may be adopted by the Biden Administration that could restrict hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands and waters. At the state level, many states have adopted legal requirements that have imposed new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, including states where our customers operate. States could also elect to place prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing and local governments may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place or manner of hydraulic fracturing activities. Finally, water is an essential component of shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Our customers' access to water to be used in these processes may be adversely affected due to reasons such as periods of extended drought, private, third party competition for water in localized areas or the implementation of local or state governmental programs to monitor or restrict the beneficial use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to assure adequate local water supplies. 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Induced Seismicity. In recent years, wells used for the disposal by injection of flowback water or certain other oilfield fluids below ground into non-producing formations have been associated with an increased number of seismic events, with research suggesting that the link between seismic events and wastewater disposal may vary by region and local geology. In response to these concerns, regulators in some of the states in which our customers operate have adopted additional requirements related to seismicity and its 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8




potential association with hydraulic fracturing. Moreover, states may issue orders to temporarily shut down or to curtail the injection depth of existing wells in the vicinity of seismic events, as was the case in 2021 and 2022 in the Permian Basin of Texas and has been the case over the past several years in central Oklahoma. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Ground-Level Ozone Standards. In 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, making the National Ambient Air Quality Standard ("NAAQS") for ground-level ozone and, in December 2020, published notice of a final action, upon conducting a periodic review of the ozone standard, electing to retain the 2015 ozone NAAQS in 2020 without revision on a going-forward basis. However, several groups have filed litigation over this December 2020 decision, and the Biden Administration has announced plans to reconsider the December 2020 final action in favor of a more stringent ground-level ozone NAAQS. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our or our customers' equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our or our customers' capital expenditures and operating costs.

(4) | Climate Change. In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level, but President Biden has made combating climate change a priority in his Administration and has issued, and may continue to issue, executive orders or other regulatory initiatives in pursuit of his regulatory agenda. Federal regulatory initiatives have focused on establishing rules impacting the oil and gas sector and relating to permitting, monitoring, reporting or restricting GHG emissions, such as methane. Since 2016, there has been considerable uncertainty surrounding regulation of the emissions of methane, with the Obama, Trump and Biden Administrations each implementing or, in the case of the Biden Administration, proposing to implement, versions of performance standards with varying restrictions on methane emissions from sources in the oil and gas industry. In January 2021, President Biden issued an executive order calling on the EPA to revisit federal regulations regarding methane and establish new or more stringent standards for existing or new sources in the oil and gas sector. U.S. Congress also passed, and President Biden signed into law, a revocation of the Trump Administration’s 2020 rulemaking in respect of these standards and effectively reinstating the Obama Administration’s 2016 standards. In response to President Biden’s executive order, in November 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would establish Quad Ob new source and Quad Oc first-time existing source standards of performance for methane and volatile organic compound emissions in the crude oil and natural gas source category. This proposed rule would apply to upstream and midstream facilities at oil and natural gas well sites, natural gas gathering and boosting compressor stations, natural gas processing plants, and transmission and storage facilities. The EPA published a supplemental proposal in November 2022, which, among other items, sets forth specific provisions strengthening the first nationwide emissions guidelines for states to limit methane emissions from existing oil and natural gas facilities, revises requirements for fugitive emissions monitoring and repair and establishes a “super-emitter” response program to timely mitigate emissions events. The proposal is expected to be finalized in 2023. Additionally, in August 2022 the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, which imposes the first ever federal methane fee on certain oil and gas operations. For more information, see our Risk Factor titled “Our and our customers’ operations are subject to a number of risks arising out of the threat of climate change, energy conservation measures or initiatives that stimulate demand for alternative forms of energy that could result in increased operating and capital costs for our customers and reduced demand for the products and services we provide.” Separately, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the international level, there exists the United Nations-sponsored “Paris Agreement,” which is a non-binding agreement among participating nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. President Biden announced in April 2021 a new, more rigorous nationally determined emissions reduction level of 50%-52% reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG emissions by 2030. Moreover, the international community gathered again in Glasgow in November 2021 at the 26th Conference of the Parties (“COP26”), during which multiple 

9



announcements (not having the effect of law) were made, including a call for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-CO2 GHGs. Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly announced at COP26 the launch of a Global Methane Pledge, an initiative which over 100 countries joined, committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030, including “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. The impacts of these orders, pledges, agreements and any legislation or regulation promulgated to fulfill the United States’ commitments under the Paris Agreement, COP26, or other international conventions cannot be predicted at this time. In other political actions, President Biden issued an executive order in January 2021 suspending new leasing activities for oil and gas exploration and production on non-Indian federal lands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices that take into consideration potential climate and other impacts associated with oil and gas activities on such lands and waters. The suspension of the federal leasing activities prompted legal action by several states against the Biden Administration, resulting in issuance of a nationwide permanent injunction by a federal district judge in Louisiana in August 2022, effectively halting implementation of the leasing suspension. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of states, municipalities and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. 
Moreover, our and our customers’ access to capital may be impacted by climate change policies. Stockholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies but concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy-related sectors. Institutional investors who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainability lending practices that favor “clean” power sources such as wind and solar and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Many of the largest U.S. banks have made “net zero” carbon emission commitments and have announced that they will be assessing financed emissions across their portfolios and taking steps to quantify and reduce those emissions. At COP26, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (“GFANZ”) announced that commitments from over 450 firms across 45 countries had resulted in over $130 trillion in capital committed to net zero goals. The various sub-alliances of GFANZ generally require participants to set short-term, sector-specific targets to transition their financing, investing, and/or underwriting activities to net zero emissions by 2050. These and other developments in the financial sector could lead to some lenders restricting or eliminating access to capital for or divesting from certain industries or companies, including the oil and natural gas sector, or requiring that borrowers take additional steps to reduce their GHG emissions. Additionally, there is the possibility that financial institutions will be pressured or required to adopt policies that limit funding to the fossil fuel sector. In late 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it had joined the Network for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”), a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. In November 2021, the Federal Reserve issued a statement in support of the efforts of the NGFS to identify key issues and potential solutions for the climate-related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory authorities. The Federal Reserve has also announced that six of the largest U.S. banks will participate in a pilot climate scenario analysis, expected to conclude at the end of 2023. While we cannot predict what policies may result from this, a material reduction in the capital available to the fossil fuel industry could make it more difficult to secure funding for acquisition, exploration, development, production, transportation, and processing activities, which could impact our service-related business and operations. To the extent the rules impose additional reporting obligations, we and our customers could incur increased costs. Furthermore, the SEC proposed rules that, amongst other matters, will require climate-related disclosures from registrants, including data on Scope 1 and 2 and, in some cases, Scope 3 GHG emissions. While we cannot predict the final form and substance of such rules, to the extent the rules impose additional reporting obligations, we and our customers could incur increased costs. Separately, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) has also announced that it is scrutinizing existing 

10



climate-change related disclosures in public filings, increasing the potential for enforcement if the SEC was to allege that an issuer’s existing climate disclosures were misleading or deficient. 
Finally, increasing concentrations of GHG in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and other climatic events, as well as chronic shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns. These climatic developments have the potential to cause physical damage to our assets and thus could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations. Additionally, changing meteorological conditions, particularly temperature, may result in changes to the amount, timing, or location of demand for energy or our production. While our consideration of changing climatic conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design is intended to reduce the uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce, our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part on the effectiveness of our facilities and our disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning, which may not have considered or be prepared for every eventuality.
 We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. The OSHA’s hazard communication standard, the EPA’s Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and comparable state regulations and any implementing regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. We have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with worker safety requirements. Additionally, there are legal requirements relating to human exposure to crystalline silica that are applicable to certain of our operations. For example, OSHA has implemented rules establishing a more stringent permissible exposure limit for exposure to respirable crystalline silica as well as other regulatory initiatives protective of our employees, including in connection with hydraulic fracturing-related activities. These workplace legal requirements remain subject to future change, including in respect of permissible exposure limits, required controls and personal protective equipment. Further, the inhalation of respirable crystalline silica is associated with health risks including, for example, the lung disease silicosis and these health risks have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the hydraulic fracturing industry. Concerns over silicosis and other potential adverse health effects, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of hydraulic fracture sand, may have the effect of discouraging our customers' use of hydraulic fracture sand. The actual or perceived health risks of handling hydraulic fracture sand could materially and adversely affect hydraulic fracturing service providers, including us, through reduced use of hydraulic fracture sand, the threat of product liability or the filing of lawsuits naming us as a defendant, increased scrutiny by federal, state and local regulatory authorities of us and our customers or reduced financing sources available to the hydraulic fracturing industry.
Additionally, as part of the services we provide, we engage third parties that operate as motor carriers and therefore, are subject to regulation by the DOT and analogous state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, regulatory safety, equipment testing, driver requirements and specifications, and insurance requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may impact our operations, including increased costs, such as changes in fuel emissions limits, hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period and limits on vehicle weight and size. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any legislative or regulatory changes or municipal ordinances applicable to our logistics operations will be enacted and to what extent any such legislation or regulations could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations. 
Intellectual Property
We continuously seek to innovate our product and service offerings to improve our operations and deliver increased value to our customers and our software team is constantly designing and building increased software capabilities to enable efficient supply chain planning and management for our customers. As such, we seek patent and trademark protections for our technology when we deem it prudent, and we aggressively pursue protection of these rights. We believe our patents, trademarks, and other protections for our proprietary technologies are adequate for the conduct of our business and that no single patent or trademark is critical to our business. In addition, we rely to a great extent on the technical expertise and know-how of our personnel to maintain our competitive position, and we take commercially 

11



reasonable measures to protect trade secrets and other confidential and/or proprietary information relating to the technologies we develop.
As of December 31, 2022, we had six issued patents in the United States, eight corollary patents issued in Canada and two corollary patents issued in Mexico; four pending utility patent applications in the United States, one in Canada, and two in Mexico. Each patent and patent application relates to our systems, services and other technologies. Our issued patents expire between 2032 and 2041, provided all of the maintenance fees are paid. We cannot make any assurances that any of our currently pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a granted patent, or whether the examination process will require us to narrow the present claims. Additionally, any issued patents may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them.
