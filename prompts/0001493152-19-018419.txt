Item 1. Business
Overview and Corporate History
 
VISIBER57 CORP. (the “Company”) formerly eBizware, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed on December 31, 2013. The Company is headquartered at Unit B19, 9/F, Efficiency House, 35 Tai Yau Street, San Po Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong. The Company was engaged in the electronic management and appointment of licensed producers in the insurance industry of the United States.
 
On August 12, 2016, in connection with the sale of a controlling interest in the Company, Mark W. DeFoor (the “Seller”), the Company’s then Chief Executive Officer and Director entered into and closed on that certain Share Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with 57 Society International Limited, (“57 Society”), a Hong Kong company, whereby 57 Society purchased from the Seller a total of 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Shares”) for an aggregate price of $321,000. The Shares acquired represented approximately 94.70% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. Following the closing of the Agreement, Mark W. DeFoor resigned from all positions held of the Company and Choong Jeng Hew was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company. The Company then ceased its activities in the electronic management and appointment of licensed producers in the insurance industry and abandoned that business model.
 
On March 23, 2017, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to change its name from eBizware, Inc. to VISIBER57 CORP. and its trading symbol to “VCOR” with an effective date of April 11, 2017. The Company is currently seeking new business opportunities or acquisitions.
 
On September 18, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to implement a 2.5-for-1 forward stock split (the “Forward Stock Split”) of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock, which became effective on November 8, 2019. Each one (1) share owned by a stockholder was exchanged for two-and-one-half (2.5) shares of common stock, and the number of shares of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding was increased proportionately based on the Forward Stock Split. The number of authorized shares was not adjusted. All issued and outstanding shares and per share amounts in the accompanying historical financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Forward Stock Split.
