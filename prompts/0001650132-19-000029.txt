Item 1. Business.
Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to “FCPT,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” include Four Corners Property Trust, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries.
History
We were incorporated as a Maryland corporation on July 2, 2015 as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Darden Restaurants, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries “Darden”), for the purpose of owning, acquiring and leasing properties on a net basis, for use in the restaurant and related food service industries. On November 9, 2015, Darden completed a spin-off of FCPT pursuant to which Darden contributed to us (i) 100% of the equity interest in entities that owned 418 properties in which Darden operates Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and other branded restaurants (the “Properties” or “Property”) and (ii) six LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants, including the properties or interests associated with such restaurants, located in the San Antonio, Texas area (the “Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business”). In exchange, we issued to Darden all of our common stock and paid to Darden $315.0 million in cash. Subsequently, Darden distributed all of our outstanding shares of common stock pro rata to holders of Darden common stock whereby each Darden shareholder received one share of our common stock for every three shares of Darden common stock held at the close of business on the record date as well as cash in lieu of any fractional shares of our common stock which they would have otherwise received (the “Spin-Off”).
Business Overview
We are a Maryland corporation and a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) which owns, acquires and leases properties for use in the restaurant and food-service related industries. Substantially all of our business is conducted through Four Corners Operating Partnership, LP (“FCPT OP”), a Delaware limited partnership of which we are a majority limited partner and our wholly owned subsidiary, Four Corners GP, LLC (“FCPT GP”), is its sole general partner. We believe that we have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for the taxable year ended December 31, 2018, and we intend to continue to operate in a manner that will enable us to maintain our qualification as a REIT.
Our revenues are primarily generated by leasing properties to Darden and other tenants through net lease arrangements under which the tenants are primarily responsible for ongoing costs relating to the properties, including utilities, property taxes, insurance, common area maintenance charges, and maintenance and repair costs. We focus on income producing properties leased to high quality tenants in major markets across the United States. We also generate revenues by operating the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business pursuant to franchise agreements with Darden. 
In addition to managing our existing properties, our strategy includes investing in additional restaurant and food service real estate properties to grow and diversify our existing restaurant portfolio. We expect this acquisition strategy will decrease our 
1

reliance on Darden over time. We intend to purchase properties that are well located, occupied by durable concepts, with creditworthy tenants whose operating cash flows are expected to meaningfully exceed their lease payments to us. We seek to improve the probability of successful tenant renewal at the end of initial lease terms by acquiring properties that have high levels of operator profitability compared to rent payments and have absolute rent levels that generally reflect market rates. 
In 2018, FCPT engaged in various real estate transactions for a total investment of $268.3 million, including capitalized transaction costs. Pursuant to these transactions, we acquired an additional 97 properties, aggregating 543 thousand square feet, and representing twenty brands, including Chili’s Grill & Bar, Red Lobster, Buffalo Wild Wings, Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, McDonald’s, Taco Bell, Texas Roadhouse, and BJ’s Restaurants. During the same period, FCPT sold two properties for $21.1 million, net of transaction costs. The proceeds from the sales were used for subsequent acquisitions via 1031 exchange transactions. 
As of December 31, 2018, our wholly-owned lease portfolio had the following characteristics:

• | 610 free-standing properties located in 45 states and representing an aggregate leasable area of 4.1 million square feet;


• | 99.9% occupancy (based on leasable square footage);


• | An average remaining lease term of 12.2 years (weighted by annualized base rent);


• | An average annual rent escalation of 1.5% through December 31, 2028 (weighted by annualized base rent); and


• | 77.2% investment-grade tenancy (weighted by annualized base rent).

Segments
We operate in two segments, real estate operations and restaurant operations. Our segments are based on our organizational and management structure, which aligns with how our results are monitored and performance is assessed. 
Our real estate operations segment consists of rental revenues primarily generated by leasing restaurant properties to tenants through net lease arrangements under which the tenant is primarily responsible for ongoing costs relating to the properties. Our real estate operations segment also includes expenses associated with continuing efforts to invest in additional restaurant and food service real estate properties and our corporate operating expenses. 
Our restaurant operations segment is conducted through a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) and consists of our Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business. The associated sales revenues, restaurant expenses and overhead on Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business’s six buildings and equipment comprise our restaurant operations. 
Our shares of common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “FCPT”.
Our executive offices are located at 591 Redwood Highway, Suite 1150, Mill Valley, California 94941, and our telephone number is (415) 965-8030.
Competitive Advantage
We believe that we have significant competitive advantages that support our core business of owning and leasing restaurant and food-service related properties as further outlined below.
Leading Nationwide REIT Focused on Restaurant Properties
We are focused on the ownership of properties used in the restaurant industry and have tailored our business strategy to address the needs of restaurant operators. We believe our scale, national reach, restaurant operations experience, and efficient lease structuring will help us achieve operational efficiencies and support future growth opportunities. In contrast to the majority of existing net-lease REITs that are diversified by retail industry and property type, we believe that our focus and expertise in the restaurant sector will generate data and insights to better support effective investment and asset management decisions. 
Large Addressable Market Potential in US Food Service 
By virtue of its large scale, we believe that the U.S. restaurant industry offers a sizable pool of attractive property acquisition targets across different types of restaurant properties, including quick service, take-out, casual dining, fast casual, and fine dining, to enable diversified growth for us. Our addressable market of restaurant real estate is substantial despite our narrow focus. 
2

According to the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Data, the food service industry had over $678 billion in sales in 2017, of which Quick Service Restaurants (“QSR”), Quick Casual Restaurants, and Casual Dining Restaurants (“CDR”) comprise approximately $485 billion combined. We plan to continue to focus on acquisitions that shift our portfolio to be more reflective of the national restaurant landscape, targeting QSR and some casual dining concepts, and with less focus on Italian and steak restaurants given the current portfolio concentration of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants. 
Furthermore, implementation of “asset light” strategies by restaurant companies may provide landlords like us an opportunity to enter into sale-leaseback transactions with franchisees or corporate-operated restaurants for their existing properties and to finance future restaurant development by these restaurant companies. We also believe there may be other attractive opportunities for growth outside the traditional restaurant sector. This may include one or more of the following: food service distribution facilities, cold storage facilities, retail properties, including non-restaurant properties located in-line with other restaurants, and other net leased real estate.
Competitively Positioned to Capitalize on Expansion Opportunities
We believe there is a large market opportunity to acquire additional restaurant properties and that a number of restaurant operators would be willing to monetize their real estate holdings while continuing to operate their existing core businesses through sale-leaseback transactions with an unrelated party not perceived to be a competitor, such as us. These restaurant operators could use the proceeds from the sale of their real estate assets for several different business purposes, including (i) reducing bank loans and lines of credit, (ii) reinvestment in existing operations, or (iii) for new business initiatives including opening new locations or pursuing acquisitions. We may also provide such restaurant operators with capital for expansion opportunities that they may not otherwise be in a position to pursue or at a cost of capital that is more attractive to the restaurant or retail operators than they may be able to receive through traditional debt financing arrangements.
Geographically Diverse Asset Portfolio
Properties in our leasing portfolio are located in 45 different states across the continental United States. The leasing portfolio properties in any one state do not account for more than 13% of our total rental revenue. We believe this geographic diversification will limit the effect of changes in any one market on our overall performance. 
Financially Secure Principal Tenant
Darden is currently our largest tenant representing approximately 77% of our tenant base by annualized base rent as of December 31, 2018. Darden owns and operates seven nationally recognized brands, including the five brands that are represented among the properties we lease to Darden: Olive Garden®, LongHorn Steakhouse®, Bahama Breeze®, Seasons 52® and Wildfish Seafood Grille®. Darden is investment grade rated at BBB/BBB/Baa2 (Fitch/S&P/Moody’s) and its liquidity position, leverage position and ability to generate significant free cash flow should provide it with the ability to pay the annual lease obligations to FCPT for the foreseeable future. Darden is subject to SEC reporting requirements, which provide ongoing transparency regarding its operating and financial performance. Darden’s filings with the SEC can be found on the SEC’s internet website at www.sec.gov. We do not intend the SEC’s website to be an active link or to otherwise incorporate the information contained on its website (including Darden’s filings with the SEC) into this report or other filings with the SEC. 
Long-Term, Net Lease Structure
Our properties are leased to our tenants on a net lease basis with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 12.2 years before any renewals and an average annual rent escalation of 1.5% through December 31, 2028 (weighted by annualized base rent), thereby providing a long-term, stable income stream. Under the leases, the tenant is responsible for maintaining the properties in accordance with prudent industry practice and in compliance with all federal and state standards. The maintenance responsibilities include, among others, maintaining the building, building systems including roofing systems and other improvements. In addition to maintenance requirements, the tenant is also generally responsible for insurance required to be carried under the leases, taxes levied on or with respect to the properties, payment of common area maintenance charges and all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the properties and the business conducted on the properties. At the option of the tenant, the leases will generally allow extensions for a certain number of multi-year renewal terms beyond the initial term and the tenant can elect which of the properties then subject to the leases to renew. The number and duration of the renewal terms for any given property may vary, however, based on the initial term of the relevant lease and other factors.

Brand Selection
We generally focus on nationally-recognized brands with hundreds of locations across the country. We believe this provides additional credit support in that our tenants’ restaurant concepts will stay viable in the long-term even if there are changes in their corporate ownership or structure. 
Management Team with Extensive Real Estate and Net Lease Experience
FCPT has a highly regarded management team with extensive retail net lease and public market REIT experience. The team is led by Bill Lenehan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Gerry Morgan, Chief Financial Officer; and James Brat, General Counsel. Prior to joining FCPT, Mr. Lenehan was on the Darden Board of Directors and chair of its Real Estate and Finance Committee. 
Our Business Objectives and Strategy
Our primary goal is to create long-term stockholder value by executing our investment objectives to maximize the value of our assets, to acquire assets with growth and diversification opportunities due to favorable lease structures and attractive submarket demographics, and to provide attractive and growing quarterly cash dividends. We do not currently have a fixed schedule of the number of acquisitions we intend to make over a particular time period, but rather, we intend to pursue those acquisitions that meet our investing and financing objectives where we can earn a return above our weighted-average cost of capital adjusted to reflect counterparty risk.
The key components of our business strategy, beyond managing our properties in accordance with our leases, include:
Acquire Additional Restaurant Properties: We plan to continue to focus on growing and diversifying our property portfolio by acquiring restaurant properties in the QSR and some CDR segments. These transactions may take many forms including, sale-leaseback transactions with restaurant operators, one-off acquisitions or acquisitions of portfolios of properties, which may include non-restaurant properties, from other REITs and other public and private real estate owners. We will employ a disciplined, opportunistic acquisition strategy and price transactions appropriately based on, among other things, the mix of assets acquired, length and terms of the lease, location and submarket attractiveness, and the credit worthiness of the existing tenant.
Acquire Additional Outparcel Properties: We plan to continue to seek out opportunities to leverage our experience in past transactions and acquire additional outparcel properties from mall and shopping center companies, providing the mall and shopping center companies with capital to expand or reinvest into their existing operations.
Re-lease Properties: Over time we will face re-tenanting risk and opportunity. If our tenants elect to cease operations at any of our properties, we will need to find a replacement tenant at the end of the lease term or earlier if a tenant abandons one of our properties prior to the end of the lease term. We plan to use leasing expertise and relationships developed through our national operations to replace tenants under any expiring or abandoned leases. 
Develop New Tenant Relationships: Our focus in the restaurant and related food service industry will allow us to cultivate new relationships with potential tenants and restaurant operators in order to expand the mix of tenants operating our properties and, in doing so, reduce our concentration with Darden.
Maintain Balance Sheet Strength and Liquidity: We intend to maintain a capital structure that provides the resources and financial flexibility to support the growth of our business. Our principal sources of liquidity will be our cash generated through operations, our revolving credit facility which has an undrawn capacity as of February 19, 2019 of $250 million, our ability to access the public equity markets, and our ability to access bank and private placement debt markets. Through disciplined capital spending and working capital management, we intend to maximize our cash flows and maintain our targeted balance sheet and leverage ratios.
Operate the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business: We operate the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business through Kerrow Holdings, LLC (“Kerrow”). Although we intend to derive the majority of our revenue from leasing properties on a net basis to restaurant and retail operators, the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business will provide us with a diversified revenue stream and equip us with the expertise to better analyze other restaurant properties that could serve as expansion opportunities.

Investment and Financing Policies
Our investment objectives are to increase cash flow, provide quarterly cash dividends, maximize the value of our assets and acquire assets with cash flow growth potential. We intend to continue to invest primarily in restaurant properties. However, over time, we believe we have the potential to diversify into other food service and related retail property types beyond the restaurant industry.
We expect that future investments in properties, including any improvements or renovations of currently owned or newly-acquired restaurant properties, will be financed, in whole or in part, with cash flow from our operations, borrowings under our $250 million revolving credit facility, or the proceeds from issuances of common stock, preferred stock, debt or other securities. Our investment and financing policies and objectives are subject to change periodically at the discretion of our Board of Directors without a vote of stockholders. We also have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we may issue equity financing through the instruments and on the terms most attractive to us at such time. In December 2016, the Company entered into an “At-the-Market” (“ATM”) sales agreement under which it can sell common stock with an aggregate value of up to $150 million through broker-dealers. In January 2017, we achieved an investment grade rating of BBB- from Fitch Ratings.
Flexible UPREIT Structure
We operate in what is commonly referred to as an UPREIT structure, in which substantially all of our properties and assets are held through FCPT OP. It is managed by FCPT GP, which accordingly controls the management and decisions of FCPT OP. Conducting business through FCPT OP allows us flexibility in the manner in which we structure and acquire properties. In particular, an UPREIT structure enables us to acquire additional properties from sellers in exchange for limited partnership units in FCPT OP. As a result, this structure potentially may facilitate our acquisition of assets in a more efficient manner and may allow us to acquire assets that the owner would otherwise be unwilling to sell to us.
Our Portfolio
At December 31, 2018, we owned 616 properties, all within the continental United States. Of these properties, 610 were held for investment, with an aggregate leasable area of approximately 4.1 million square feet, were located in 45 states, and had a weighted average remaining lease term of 12.2 years before any lease renewals. The remaining six properties, representing the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business, are operated by Kerrow subject to franchise agreements with Darden (“Franchise Agreements”). Three of these restaurants are subject to ground leases.
The following table summarizes the rental properties by brand as of December 31, 2018:

Leases with Darden
The estimated annual cash rent based on current rates for the leases in place with Darden is approximately $96.3 million, with average annual rent escalations of 1.5% each year. Darden also entered into guaranties, pursuant to which it guarantied the obligations of the tenants under substantially all of the leases entered into in respect of the Properties. The Properties are leased to one or more of Darden’s operating subsidiaries pursuant to the leases, which are net leases. The leases provide for an average remaining initial term of approximately 11.4 years as of December 31, 2018, with no purchase options provided that Darden will have a right of first offer with respect to our sale of any property, if there is no default under the lease, and we will be prohibited from selling any Properties to (i) any nationally recognized casual or fine dining brand restaurant or entity operating the same or (ii) any other regionally recognized casual or fine dining brand restaurant or entity operating the same, with 25 or more units. At the option of Darden, the leases will generally allow extensions for a certain number of renewal terms of five years each beyond the initial term and Darden can elect which of our properties then subject to the leases to renew. The number and duration of the renewal terms for any given Property may vary, however, based on the initial term of the relevant lease and other factors.
Darden is currently the source of a majority of our revenues, and its financial condition and ability and willingness to satisfy its obligations under the leases and its willingness to renew the leases upon expiration of the initial base term thereof significantly impacts our revenues and our ability to service our indebtedness and make distributions to our stockholders. There can be no 
6

assurance that Darden will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under its leases with us, and any inability or unwillingness on its part to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, on our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and on our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. We also cannot assure you that Darden will elect to renew the lease arrangements with us upon expiration of the initial base terms or any renewal terms thereof or, if such leases are not renewed, that we can re-market the affected properties on the same or better terms. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - We are dependent on our major tenants successfully operating their businesses, and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.”
Franchise Agreements
Pursuant to the Franchise Agreements, Darden grants the right and license to our subsidiary, Kerrow, to operate the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business. The Franchise Agreements include, among other things, a license to display trademarks, utilize trade secrets and purchase proprietary products from Darden. Other services to be included pursuant to the Franchise Agreements are marketing services, training and access to certain LongHorn® operating procedures. The Franchise Agreements also contain provisions under which Darden may provide certain technical support for the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business. The fees and conditions of these franchising services are on terms comparable to similar franchising services negotiated on an arm’s length basis and consistent with industry standard provisions. 
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive market and face competition from other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, restaurant and retail operators, lenders and other investors, some of whom are significantly larger and have greater resources and lower costs of capital. These institutions may accept greater risk or lower returns, allowing them to offer more attractive terms to prospective tenants or for the acquisition of restaurant properties. Our restaurant operations also face active competition with national and regional chains and locally-owned restaurants for guests, management and hourly personnel.
Governmental Regulations Affecting Properties
Property Environmental Considerations
As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Although we do not operate or manage most of our properties, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any of our current or former properties at or from which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous material, as well as other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the contamination.
In addition to these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property’s value, we or our tenants could be subject to other liabilities, including governmental penalties for violation of environmental, health and safety laws, liabilities for injuries to persons for exposure to hazardous materials, and damages to property or natural resources. Furthermore, some environmental laws can create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination or can restrict the manner in which a property may be used because of contamination. We also could be liable for the costs of remediating contamination at third party sites, e.g., landfills, where we send waste for disposal without regard to whether we comply with environmental laws in doing so.
Although the leases require our tenants to indemnify us for environmental liabilities, and although we intend to require our other operators and tenants to undertake to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities, including environmental liabilities they cause, the amount of such liabilities could exceed the financial ability of Darden, or such other tenant or operator to indemnify us. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell, develop or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.
As of February 19, 2019, we have not been notified by any governmental authority of, nor is management aware of, any non-compliance or liability with respect to environmental laws that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.
7

Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
The properties, as commercial facilities, are required to comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and similar state and local laws and regulations (collectively the “ADA”). Investigation of a property may reveal non-compliance with the ADA. The tenant has the primary responsibility for complying with the ADA, but we may incur costs if the tenant does not comply. As of February 18, 2019, we have not been notified by any governmental authority of, nor is management aware of, any non-compliance with the ADA that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.
Other Regulations
State and local fire, life-safety and similar entities regulate the use of the properties. The tenant has the primary responsibility for complying with regulations but failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants, or restrictions to conduct business on such properties.
Insurance
Our current lease agreements generally require, and new lease agreements that we enter are expected to require, that our tenants maintain all customary lines of insurance on our properties and their operations, including comprehensive insurance and hazard insurance. The tenants under the Leases may have the ability to self-insure or use a captive provider with respect to its insurance obligations. We believe that the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants are customary for similarly situated companies in our industry. However, we cannot make any assurances that Darden or any other tenants in the future will maintain the required insurance coverages, and the failure by any of them to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. 
Employees
As of February 1, 2019, we had 361 employees, of which 345 were employed at our Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business. None of these employees are represented by a labor union.
