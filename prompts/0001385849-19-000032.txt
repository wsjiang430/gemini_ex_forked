Business Overview
Energy Fuels is engaged in conventional and in situ (“ISR”) uranium extraction and recovery, along with the exploration, permitting, and evaluation of uranium properties in the United States. The Company also extracts and recovers vanadium as market conditions warrant. Energy Fuels owns the Nichols Ranch Uranium Recovery Facility in Wyoming (the “Nichols Ranch Project”), which is an operating uranium recovery facility, and the Alta Mesa Project in Texas (the "Alta Mesa Project"), which is a fully-permitted ISR uranium production facility currently on standby. In addition, Energy Fuels owns the White Mesa Mill in Utah (the “White Mesa Mill” or “Mill”), which is the only conventional uranium and vanadium recovery facility operating in the United States. The Company also owns uranium and uranium/vanadium properties and projects in various stages of exploration, permitting, and 
11

evaluation, as well as fully-permitted uranium and uranium/vanadium projects, and a uranium/copper project, on standby. The White Mesa Mill is currently recovering vanadium pentoxide (“V2O5”) from existing tailings pond solutions which result from past mineral processing operations. The Mill can also recover vanadium from mineralized material produced from certain of its projects in Colorado and Utah and is evaluating recovering copper as a by-product from a uranium/copper project in Arizona. In addition, Energy Fuels recovers uranium from other uranium-bearing materials not derived from conventional material, referred to as “alternate feed materials,” at its White Mesa Mill.
ISR Operations
The Company conducts its ISR activities through (i) its Nichols Ranch Project in northeast Wyoming, which it acquired in June 2015 through its acquisition of Uranerz Energy Corporation (“Uranerz”), and (ii) its Alta Mesa Project in south Texas, which the Company acquired in June 2016 through its acquisition of Mesteña Uranium, LLC (“Mesteña”), which is now named EFR Alta Mesa LLC ("EFR Alta Mesa"). 
The Nichols Ranch Project includes: (i) a licensed and operating ISR processing facility (the “Nichols Ranch Plant”); (ii) licensed and operating ISR wellfields (the “Nichols Ranch Wellfields”); (iii) additional licensed ISR wellfields planned for future production (the “Jane Dough Property”), and; (iv) a licensed satellite ISR uranium project (the “Hank Project”), which will include an ISR satellite processing plant (the “Hank Satellite Plant”) that, when constructed, will produce loaded-resin, and associated planned wellfields (the “Hank Property”). See “The Nichols Ranch ISR Project” under Item 2 below. Also through the acquisition of Uranerz, the Company acquired the West North Butte property (the “West North Butte Property”), the North Rolling Pin property (the “North Rolling Pin Property”), and the Reno Creek property (the “Reno Creek Property”), as well as the Arkose Mining Venture (the “Arkose Mining Venture”), which is a joint venture of Wyoming ISR properties held 81% by Energy Fuels. The Company subsequently sold the Reno Creek Property to Uranium Energy Corp. in May 2018. See “Non-Material Mineral Properties - Other ISR Projects” under Item 2 below.
The Nichols Ranch Project is an operating ISR facility that recovers uranium through a series of injection and recovery wells. Using groundwater fortified with oxygen and sodium bicarbonate, uranium is dissolved within a deposit. The uranium-bearing groundwater is then collected in a series of recovery wells and pumped to the Nichols Ranch Plant where the uranium is extracted from the water. The Nichols Ranch Plant creates a yellowcake slurry that is transported by truck to the White Mesa Mill, where it is dried and packaged into drums that are shipped to uranium conversion facilities.
Construction of the Nichols Ranch Plant, other than the elution, drying and packaging circuits, was completed in 2013, and it commenced uranium recovery activities in the second quarter of 2014. In September of 2015, the Company commenced construction of an elution circuit at the Nichols Ranch Plant, which was completed and began operations in February 2016. During 2018, a total of 140,191 pounds of U3O8 were recovered from the Nichols Ranch Project. The Company is evaluating undertaking Uranium Readiness activities at the Nichols Ranch Project (see “2018 and 2019 Corporate Developments” below). 
The Alta Mesa Project is a fully licensed, permitted and constructed ISR processing facility that has an operating capacity of 1.5 million pounds of uranium per year and comprises a total of 195,501 contiguous acres of land. The Alta Mesa Project is currently on standby and ready to resume production as market conditions warrant. It is expected to be able to reach commercial production levels with limited required capital within approximately twelve months of a production decision. See “The Alta Mesa Project” under Item 2 below. The Company is evaluating undertaking Uranium Readiness activities at the Alta Mesa Project (see “Subsequent Events” below). 
Conventional Operations
The Company conducts its conventional uranium and vanadium extraction and recovery activities through its White Mesa Mill, which is the only operating conventional uranium and vanadium processing facility in the United States. The White Mesa Mill, located near Blanding Utah, is centrally located such that it can be fed by a number of the Company’s uranium, uranium/vanadium and uranium/copper projects in Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, as well as by ore purchases or toll milling arrangements with third parties in the region as market conditions warrant.
The White Mesa Mill is licensed to process 2,000 tons of mineralized material per day. It is primarily a uranium recovery facility, but can also recover vanadium. The Company is also evaluating recovering copper as a by-product of uranium recovery from a project in Arizona. In addition, the Mill can recycle other uranium-bearing materials not derived from conventional ore, referred to as "alternate feed materials," for the recovery of uranium, alone or in combination with other metals.
The White Mesa Mill has historically operated on a campaign basis, whereby mineral processing occurs as mill feed, contract requirements, and market conditions warrant. Over the years, the Company’s own, and third-party owned, conventional uranium properties in Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico have been both active and on standby, from time-to-time, in response to changing market conditions. From 2007 through 2014, running on a campaign basis, the White Mesa Mill recovered on average over 1 million pounds of U3O8 per year from conventional sources, including its La Sal Project, Daneros Project, and Tony M 
12

property in Utah; its Arizona 1 and Pinenut Projects in Arizona; and alternate feed materials. During 2016, the Mill recovered a total of 680,000 lbs. of U3O8, of which 433,000 pounds were recovered from conventional materials from the Company's Pinenut Project and 248,000 pounds from processing alternate feed materials. During 2017, the Mill recovered 310,000 pounds of U3O8 from processing pond solutions and 1,000,000 pounds from processing alternate feed materials, of which a total of 360,000 pounds were for the Company's account and 950,000 pounds were for the account of third parties. During 2018, the Mill recovered 215,719 pounds of U3O8 from processing pond solutions and 561,628 pounds from processing alternate feed materials, of which a total of 82,709 pounds were for the Company's account and 448,919 pounds were for the account of third parties under a tolling arrangement. In late 2018, the White Mesa Mill transitioned to producing vanadium from pond solutions, which is expected to be the focus of the Mill’s operations in 2019, subject to continued favorable market conditions for vanadium.
The Company continues to receive and process alternate feed materials at the White Mesa Mill. At the Company’s permitted Canyon Project, an underground drilling project and shaft were completed in the first quarter of 2018. The timing to extract and process mineralized material from the Canyon Project will be based on market conditions, available financing, and sales requirements. The Company’s Pinenut Project, where mineral extraction activities occurred until September 2015, is now depleted and reclamation activities have commenced. The Company is also pursuing a small-scale test mining campaign targeting vanadium at its La Sal Complex, and is evaluating undertaking various Uranium Readiness activities at its La Sal and Canyon mines (see “Subsequent Events” below). All of the Company’s other conventional properties and projects are currently in the permitting process or on standby pending improvements in market conditions. No third-party conventional properties are active at this time.
The Company also owns the Sheep Mountain Project (the “Sheep Mountain Project”), which is a conventional uranium extraction project located in Wyoming. Due to its distance from the White Mesa Mill, the Sheep Mountain Project is not expected to be a source of feed material for the Mill. The Sheep Mountain Project consists of permitted open pit and underground extraction components (the “Sheep Mountain Extraction Operation”) and a planned processing facility to process extracted mineralized material (the “Sheep Mountain Processing Operation”), which has not yet been permitted.
The Company’s principal conventional properties include the following:

• | the White Mesa Mill, a 2,000 ton per day uranium and vanadium processing facility, which is also evaluating recovering copper as a by-product of uranium recovery from the Company's Canyon Project, located near Blanding, Utah, held through the Company’s subsidiary EFR White Mesa LLC.

Mineral Exploration
13

Energy Fuels holds a number of exploration properties in the Colorado Plateau, White Canyon, Grants, Arizona Strip, and Powder River Basin Districts. Energy Fuels conducted intermittent exploration drilling on numerous projects in the period from February 2007 through December 2013. Several of those projects have been abandoned or sold. No further exploration drilling has been performed at these properties since 2013. See “Non-Material Mineral Properties” under Item 2 below.
Development of the Business -- Major Transactions over the Past Five Years
Over the past five years, the Company has completed the following major transactions:

• | In two transactions in 2014, the Company sold its interest in the Pinon Ridge uranium/vanadium mill project located in western Colorado, that the Company had previously planned to develop, along with a number of other non-core uranium properties;


• | In June 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Uranerz. Under that transaction, the Company acquired the Nichols Ranch Project, the Hank Project, the Reno Creek Property, the West North Butte Property, the North Rolling Pin Property, the Company’s interest in the Arkose Mining Venture, uranium sales contracts, and other assets, as well as the shares of Uranerz, which holds those assets;


• | In two separate transactions in February and November of 2015, the Company acquired 100% ownership of the Wate Project through the acquisition of Wate Mining Company LLC;

2018 Corporate Developments
On January 16, 2018, the Company and Ur-Energy announced that they had jointly filed a Petition for Relief with the U.S. Department of Commerce (“DOC”) under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (as amended) from Imports of Uranium Products that Threaten National Security (the "Section 232 Petition"). The Section 232 Petition describes how uranium and nuclear fuel from state-owned and state-subsidized enterprises in Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and China potentially represent a threat to U.S. national security. The Section 232 Petition seeks remedies which will set a quota to limit imports of uranium into the U.S., effectively reserving 25% of the U.S. nuclear market for U.S. uranium production. Additionally, the Section 232 Petition suggests implementation of a requirement for U.S. federal utilities and agencies to buy U.S. uranium in accordance with the President’s Buy American Policy.
Effective February 1, 2018, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) appointed Mark S. Chalmers as President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and a Director of the Company. On January 31, 2018, Stephen P. Antony retired as CEO and as a Director of the Company. In addition, effective as of March 2, 2018, David C. Frydenlund was appointed Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, replacing Daniel G. Zang, who left the Company on March 1, 2018. Effective February 14, 2018, W. Paul Goranson was appointed Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) of the Company and Matthew J. Tarnowski was appointed Chief Accounting Officer (“CAO”) and Controller of the Company.
Effective March 12, 2018, Barbara A. Filas was appointed to serve as a Director of the Company, filling a vacancy on the Board. 
On May 1, 2018, the Company closed the sale of its non-core Reno Creek property in Wyoming to Uranium Energy Corp. (“UEC”) for $5.39 million, including $2.94 million in cash and $2.45 million in common shares of UEC.
On June 25, 2018, the Company announced that it had been added as a member of the broad-market Russell 3000® Index, as part of the 2018 Russell indexes reconstitution. Annual reconstitution of the Russell indexes captures the 3,000 largest U.S. stocks as of May 11, ranking them by total market capitalization. Membership in the Russell 3000® Index, which remains in place for one year, means automatic inclusion into the large-cap Russell 1000® Index or small-cap Russell 2000® Index, as well as the appropriate growth and value style indexes.
On July 18, 2018, the US Department of Commerce announced the initiation of its investigation pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act in response to the Company’s Section 232 Petition (the “Section 232 Investigation”).
On August 14, 2018, the Company announced the acquisition and extinguishment of royalties on the Nichols Ranch Project, as well as the acquisition of a significant royalty on a number of properties owned by Cameco Corporation in northern Wyoming. 
On September 12, 2018, the Company announced it had repaid and retired the entire outstanding principal balance on its Wyoming Industrial Development Revenue Bond, totaling $8.3 million, thereby eliminating future interest and principal payments.
14

On September 27, 2018, the Company announced it was commencing vanadium production from the pond solutions at its 100% owned White Mesa Mill. The Company estimates the pond solutions contain approximately four (4) million pounds of recoverable V2O5, and the Company expects to produce approximately 200,000 to 225,000 pounds of V2O5 per month for a period of 16 to 20 months, subject to market conditions, costs, and recoveries. Vanadium recovery commenced in late December 2018 and the first batches of finished vanadium product (“black flake”) were produced in January 2019.
On November 5, 2018, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to its U.S. registration statement, qualifying for distribution up to $24.5 in aggregate common shares under the ATM. Then, on the same date, the Company filed a new base shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC allowing the Company to issue common shares, warrants, subscription receipts, preferred shares, debt securities, or any combination of such securities as units, in amounts, and at prices, and on terms to be determined based on market conditions at the time of sale, and as set forth in an accompanying prospectus supplement, for an aggregate offering amount of up to US$150 million in the U.S. during the 36-month period that the statement remains effective. On December 27, 2018, the Company received a receipt for a corresponding base shelf prospectus in Canada for an aggregate offering amount in Canada of up to US$150 million.
Company Strategy
Energy Fuels intends to continue to strengthen its position as a leading uranium extraction and recovery company in the United States, supporting that goal through uranium recovery, alternate feed materials processing, third-party processing, and potential land clean-up work. In addition, the Company produces vanadium along with uranium from certain of its properties, as market conditions warrant. Through the operating White Mesa Mill, the operating Nichols Ranch Project, the standby Alta Mesa Project, our large uranium and vanadium resource base, and existing conventional projects on standby, under construction, and in permitting, the Company’s strategy is to maintain and increase its ability to increase uranium production in improved market conditions. 
As a result of the foregoing, we intend to engage in the following activities:

• | Produce from existing wellfields (wellfields #1 through #9) at Nichols Ranch and defer further wellfield development at Nichols Ranch until uranium prices improve;


• | Continue alternate feed processing and recovery of uranium from uranium dissolved in the Mill’s ponds, as well as pursue additional alternate feed materials, third party processing and other sources of feed for the Mill, including potential material generated from land cleanup work;


• | Continue to ramp-up and sustain the recovery of vanadium from pond solutions at the Mill while vanadium prices remain supportive of continued production;


• | Continue to carry out engineering, procurement and construction management activities at the Canyon Project in 2020, and maintain the property on standby until uranium prices improve;


• | Continue evaluating the possibility of recovering copper at the White Mesa Mill as a by-product from the Canyon Project and pursue any permitting actions that may be required;


• | Continue to maintain standby projects and facilities (including the Canyon Project, Alta Mesa Project, the La Sal Project and the Daneros Project) in a state of readiness for the purpose of restarting mining activities, as market conditions may warrant. At this time, all of the Company’s conventional projects are expected to remain on standby until market conditions warrant restarting mining activities, or are in the evaluation or permitting process;


• | Continue permitting activities for the Roca Honda Project through the end of 2019;


• | Continue to pursue an appropriate trade remedy under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (as amended) from Imports of Uranium Products that Threaten U.S. National Security;


• | Continue to evaluate the sale or abandonment of non-core assets that the Company does not believe contribute to shareholder value in order to reduce costs and/or receive sales proceeds; and


• | Continue to pursue additional cost cutting measures.

Subsequent Events
On January 7, 2019, the Company announced that it commenced a campaign to recover vanadium pentoxide (“V2O5”) from existing tailings pond solutions at the White Mesa Mill, which result from past mineral processing operations. In early January 
15

2019, the Company produced its first batches of vanadium concentrate, also known as “black flake.” This is Energy Fuels’ first vanadium production since 2013, and the first time the Company has recovered vanadium from tailings pond solutions at the Mill. The Company estimates there are up to four (4) million pounds of recoverable vanadium dissolved in these Mill pond solutions. The Company had originally intended to commence this campaign in November 2018 but elected to delay commencement to December 2018 in order to accommodate additional uranium production at the Mill.
On January 7, 2019, the Company announced that it also expects to launch a number of key uranium readiness ("Uranium Readiness") initiatives in 2019 intended to enhance the Company’s ability to more quickly and effectively respond to improved uranium market conditions that may result from the ongoing Section 232 Investigation in the United States or improvements in global uranium market fundamentals. During 2019, the Company plans to invest a total of approximately $4.2 million in initiatives at the following projects:

• | La Sal Complex: The Company expects to continue the current test-mining program targeting vanadium at its La Sal mine. The Company is also planning to begin refurbishing and potentially test-mining a second uranium/vanadium mine within the La Sal Complex, the fully-permitted Pandora mine. The purpose of the test-mining program is to evaluate different mining approaches that selectively target high-grade vanadium zones, thereby potentially increasing productivity and mined grades for vanadium and decreasing mining costs per pound of V2O5and U3O8


• | Nichols Ranch ISR Project: The Company has purchased and expects to install new ion exchange capacity, and upgrade other equipment, at the Company’s 100% owned Nichols Ranch in situ recovery (“ISR”) Plant in Wyoming. These upgrades will increase flow capacity through the plant and are thereby expected to reduce operating costs per pound and significantly increase the uranium production capacity of Nichols Ranch.


• | Alta Mesa ISR Project: The Company expects to complete a 200-hole surface drilling program at the Company’s 100%-owned Alta Mesa ISR Project in South Texas, in order to increase and upgrade the uranium resources and extend the life-of-mine production profile of this project.


• | Canyon Project: The Company expects to continue to evaluate the copper metallurgy and perform other development work at this key low-cost uranium and copper project.

On February 12, 2019, the Company announced that it is now producing high-purity vanadium from existing tailings pond solutions at the White Mesa Mill at commercial rates of approximately 175,000 to 200,000 pounds of V2O5 per month and that shipments of vanadium have commenced for sale to customers. Ramp-up is expected to continue in the coming weeks, and the Company continues to expect to reach full production rates of 200,000 to 225,000 pounds of high-purity V2O5 per month by the end of Q1-2019 or sooner. The Company also announced that it had begun vanadium shipments, with initial quantities being allocated for conversion to ferrovanadium that will be sold into spot metallurgical markets. The Company expects to sell finished vanadium product into the metallurgical industry, as well as other markets that demand a higher purity product, including the aerospace, chemical, and potentially the vanadium battery industry. 
Uranium Sales
As a result of current uranium market conditions, both ISR and conventional uranium recovery are being maintained at reduced levels until such time as market conditions improve sufficiently, either as a result of potential relief under the ongoing Section 232 Investigation or through improved market fundamentals. 
The Company has entered into no uranium sales commitments in 2019; therefore, all 2019 uranium production is expected to be added to existing inventories. Energy Fuels’ significant uranium inventory provides the Company with financial flexibility, and the Company believes its existing inventories and new production may be worth significantly more in the future. However, if suitable uranium price increases are observed in 2019, or if cash needs arise, the Company may elect to complete some discretionary uranium sales in 2019.
Overview of Uranium Market
The primary commercial use of uranium is to fuel nuclear power plants for the generation of electricity. All of the uranium extracted from Energy Fuels’ projects is expected to be used for this purpose.
According to the World Nuclear Association (“WNA”), as of February 2019, there were 445 operable nuclear reactors world-wide, which required approximately 143 million pounds of U3O8 fuel in 2017 at full operation. Worldwide, there are currently 57 new reactors under construction with an additional 126 reactors on order or in the planning stage and 383 which have been proposed.
According to data from TradeTech LLC (“TradeTech”), the world continues to require more uranium than it produces from primary extraction, largely due to increasing uranium demands in Asia. The gap between demand and primary supply is filled by stockpiled inventories and secondary supplies.
16

According to the WNA, the United States currently has 98 operating reactors, four (4) reactors actively under construction, and another 42 reactors on order, planned or proposed. According to the Nuclear Energy Institute ("NEI"), in 2017 the United States produced approximately 20.0% of its electricity from nuclear technology, while achieving an average capacity factor of 92%, leading all other sources by a wide margin. In addition, in 2016, nuclear energy avoided 554 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency (“EIA”), U.S. utilities purchased approximately 43.0 million pounds of U3O8 in 2017. However, in 2018 the U.S. only produced approximately 1.47 million pounds of U3O8. 
Uranium is not traded on an open market or organized commodity exchange such as the London Metal Exchange, although the New York Mercantile Exchange provides financially-settled uranium futures contracts. Typically, buyers and sellers negotiate transactions privately and directly. Spot uranium transactions typically involve deliveries that occur immediately and up to 12 months in the future. Term uranium transactions typically involve deliveries that occur more than 12 months in the future, with long-term transactions involving delivery terms of at least three years. Uranium prices, both spot and term, are published by two independent market consulting firms, TradeTech and The Ux Consulting Company (“Ux”), on a weekly and monthly basis. Other brokers, including Numerco Ltd., Uranium Markets LLC, and Evolution Markets Inc., also publish daily broker average uranium prices.
The spot and term prices of uranium are influenced by a number of global factors. For example, both the spot and term prices of uranium were negatively impacted by the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant in March 2011. The events at Fukushima created heightened concerns regarding the safety of nuclear plants and led to both temporary and permanent closures of nuclear plants around the world. The Fukushima incident has created downward pressure on uranium prices over the past eight years, which is still being felt today. In contrast, China is pursuing an aggressive nuclear program, with 45 units now operating, 13 new units under construction (compared to only eleven operable units ten years ago in January 2009), 43 units which are planned, and 170 units that have been proposed, according to February 2019 WNA data.
Historically, most nuclear utilities have sought to purchase a portion of their uranium needs through mid- and long-term supply contracts, while other portions are bought on the spot market. Like sellers, buyers seek to balance the security of supply with the opportunity to take advantage of lower prices caused by volatility in prices. For this reason, both buyers and sellers track current spot and term prices for uranium carefully, make considered projections as to future prices, and negotiate with one another on transactions which each deems favorable to their respective interests.

According to monthly price data from TradeTech, uranium prices during 2018 were up $3.25, or 14% for the year. Monthly spot prices began the year at $23.75 per pound of U3O8 on December 31, 2017 and ended the year at $27.00 per pound, reaching a high of $29.10 per pound for the month of November 2018 and a low of $21.00 per pound for the months of March and April 2018. According to Trade Tech, the spot price was $28.10 per pound on March 8, 2019. TradeTech price data also indicated that long-term U3O8 prices began 2018 at $31.00 per pound and ended 2018 at $32.00 per pound. The high long-term price for 2018 was $32.00 per pound for September and December, and the low long-term price was $28.00 per pound for March through June. The long-term price at March 8, 2019 was $32.00 per pound. The Company believes the weak uranium markets are the result of excess uranium supplies caused by large quantities of secondary uranium extraction and excess inventories, the availability of low-priced spot material, the delayed restart of Japanese reactors, insufficient production cut-backs especially from state-owned and state-subsidized uranium and uranium fuel entities, premature reactor closures, and continued weak uranium demand.
Uranium Market Outlook and Uranium Marketing Strategy
World demand for clean, reliable, and affordable baseload electricity is growing. As a result of the expected growth of nuclear energy, the Company believes the long-term fundamentals of the uranium industry remain positive. The Company believes prices must rise to higher levels to support the new primary production that will be required to meet the increasing demand we expect to see as more nuclear units are constructed around the world. According to TradeTech, world uranium requirements continue to exceed primary mine production, with the gap being bridged by secondary supplies and excess uranium inventories in various forms that have already been mined. In addition, it is the Company's belief that additional mine production cutbacks will be required to bring the market into balance in the short and medium terms. However, a large portion of global uranium production is state-owned and state-subsidized, and therefore not subject to normal market fundamentals. It is for this reason that the Company and Ur-Energy submitted the Section 232 Petition to the DOC in 2018 to initiate an investigation into the effects of uranium imports on U.S. national security. In July 2018, the DOC initiated the Section 232 Investigation. Petitioners proposed a quota system that limits uranium and uranium fuel imports, effectively reserving 25% of the U.S. nuclear market for U.S. uranium producers. In 2018, it was estimated that less than 2% of U.S. reactor demand was met by new production from U.S. uranium mines. The Company has believed for several years that market forces will cause uranium prices, and long-term contracting levels in particular, to return to levels that are sufficient to incentivize new mine production. However, it is the Company's belief that non-free market forces have delayed this recovery. The 232 Investigation may result in remedies that help address this situation.
The Company believes prices likely hit a bottom in 2016, and despite considerable market uncertainty in 2018, the lows of 2016, which began to improve in 2017, were not repeated in 2018. During the year, several positive developments occurred. In May 2018, the State of New Jersey passed legislation supporting nuclear energy in the state, and uranium was included on a draft list published by the U.S. Department of Interior of 35 minerals which are considered critical to the economic and national security of the US (TradeTech NMR May 25, 2018). Paladin announced that it was placing its Langer Heinrich mine in Namibia on care and maintenance (TradeTech NMR, May 25, 2018). Kazakhstan announced cuts that would result in 2018 production being 12.5% lower than 2016 (TradeTech NMR, June 8, 2018). Two new uranium funds also advanced. Yellowcake plc raised £150 million and purchased approximately 8 million pounds of U3O8 in mid-July (TradeTech NMR, July 13, 2018). In Japan, the government reaffirmed its 20-22% nuclear power share by 2030 in its draft revised Strategic Energy Plan (TradeTech NMR May 18, 2018). Also, Kyushu Electric announced the restart of the 9th reactor to return to service (Genkai 4) in Japan (TradeTech NMR, June 22, 2018). In July 2018, Cameco announced that the McArthur River/Key Lake suspension in Canada was “extended for indeterminate duration," and that Cameco’s total production in 2019 would be only be about nine million pounds of U3O8 versus expected contract delivery commitments of 25.0 to 27.0 million pounds of U3O8. Furthermore, Cameco announced that it would purchase 8.0 to 9.0 million pounds of U3O8 in 2018 and likely more in 2019 (TradeTech NMR, July 27, 2018). On July 18, 2018, the DOC initiated the Section 232 Investigation into U.S. uranium imports (TradeTech NMR, July 27, 2018). Kazakhstan announced that uranium production was 6% lower in the first half of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 (TradeTech NMR, August 17, 2018).

The Company believes that certain uranium supply and demand fundamentals are pointing to higher prices in the future, including significant production cuts and increased demand from utilities, financial entities, traders, and producers. However, the Company also believes that while uranium market conditions have improved in 2018, they still remain weak primarily as a result of excess uranium supplies caused by large quantities of secondary uranium supplies, excess inventories, and thus far insufficient primary production cut-backs. The Company also continues to believe that the Company’s joint filing of the Section 232 Petition, discussed below, has injected uncertainty into the market, causing utilities and other market participants to be less aggressive in their buying and selling activities at this time.
In the short- and medium-terms, market challenges remain. The world continues to be oversupplied with uranium, mainly due to large quantities of secondary and other inelastic uranium supplies (including enricher underfeeding and state-owned and state-subsidized uranium and nuclear fuel production), high levels of excess inventories, insufficient producer cut-backs, premature reactor shutdowns, and delays in new reactor construction, There remains a great deal of uncertainty in uranium prices regarding the timing and level of the recovery, as fundamental, political, technical, and other factors could cause prices to be significantly above or below currently expected ranges.
The Company’s marketing strategy is to seek a base of earnings and cash flow through sales of a portion of its uranium into term contracts, to the extent such contracts are available at satisfactory prices. To gain exposure to increasing uranium prices, the Company seeks to sell a portion of its planned uranium extraction into contracts with market-related formulas, if available at satisfactory prices, and through future spot and term sales. Further exposure to increasing uranium prices can be generated through the Company’s ability to bring additional uranium extraction online in the future in response to increasing prices, which can be sold on a market-related or fixed basis at then prevailing prices.
During 2018, the pricing on all of the Company’s contracts, other than the spot contract referenced above, were at their floors or at prices fixed by the contract. During 2018, the Company sold 650,000 pounds of U3O8 at a weighted- average price of $49.27 per pound. This included 400,000 pounds of sales under contracts at a price of $61.30 per pound and 150,000 pounds into contracts based on spot market prices at a weighted average price of $26.74 per pound.
The Company completed the remaining uranium deliveries under all its long-term contracts. Therefore, all of the Company’s current uranium production is 100% unhedged, and all uranium sales in 2019 and beyond will be made on the spot market or pursuant to new long-term contracts to the extent such contracts may be available on satisfactory terms. While the Company does not currently forecast the need to complete any spot sales in 2019 for cash generation purposes, uranium inventories, along with expected uranium production in 2019, are expected to provide the Company with the flexibility to complete spot sales in 2019 if market conditions warrant.
The Vanadium Market 
The White Mesa Mill has historically recovered vanadium along with uranium from certain of its properties on the Colorado Plateau, including from the La Sal Project and Rim Mine, as well as from properties owned by third-parties on the Colorado Plateau through toll milling and similar arrangements, when the price of vanadium has been high enough to justify its recovery. 
In addition, in December 2018, the Company commenced a campaign to recover V2O5 from existing tailings pond solutions at the Company’s White Mesa Mill, which result from past mineral processing operations. In early January 2019, the Company produced its first batches of vanadium concentrate, also known as “black flake”. This is Energy Fuels’ first vanadium production since 2013, and the first time the Company has recovered vanadium from tailings pond solutions at the Mill.
Vanadium is a metallic element that, when converted into ferrovanadium ("FeV") (an alloy of vanadium and iron), is used primarily as an additive to strengthen and harden steel. According to market consultant Roskill, over 90% of FeV is used in the steel industry. In addition, vanadium is used in the aerospace and chemical industries, and continues to see interest in energy storage technologies, including vanadium redox flow batteries. China is the largest global producer of vanadium, with additional production coming from Russia, South Africa, and Brazil (Roskill). Vanadium (as V2O5) prices were up sharply in 2018, with mid-point spot prices beginning the year at $9.75 per pound, and ending the year at $15.50 per pound, reaching a high of $28.83 per pound in November 2018 (Metal Bulletin). Vanadium prices are currently at $17.28 per pound.
According to Roskill, prices have risen primarily as a result of tightening supplies in China, including the shutdown of vanadium producing facilities for environmental reasons, and increased demand in China, which is requiring the use of rebar that contains increased quantities of vanadium.
In the past, Energy Fuels has sold its vanadium both as V2O5 and as FeV through spot sales to industry end-users and trading companies. The Company is currently producing V2O5 from pond solutions and beginning to sell finished product to end-users. The Company is also pursuing a small-scale test mining campaign targeting vanadium at the La Sal Complex.
The Copper Market 
19

The White Mesa Mill has produced vanadium and other metals, such as tantalum, along with its uranium recovery, but has not to date produced copper. Due to the discovery of significant quantities of copper mineralization at the Canyon Project, the Company is investigating potential alternatives for recovering copper as a byproduct of uranium recovery at the White Mesa Mill.
Copper is a malleable and ductile metallic element that has a number of industrial uses, including as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a building material, in industrial machinery, and as a component of certain metal alloys. According to the International Copper Study Group ("ICSG"), an intergovernmental organization that operates as the international commodity board for copper, the major product categories of the copper trade are copper concentrates, copper blister and anode, refined copper cathode and ingots, copper scrap, copper semis, and a small amount of copper powders and compounds. Copper is mainly shipped by producers to fabricators as cathode, wire rod, billet, cake (slab), or ingot. Two of the key components of the copper market are the spot price (settlement price for a transaction today) and the future price. A futures or option contract defines the price of the delivery, the quantity of the product, the delivery date(s), and delivery location(s) and other aspects. Three main commodity exchanges provide the facilities to trade copper: the London Metal Exchange ("LME"), Commodity Exchange Division of the New York Mercantile Exchange ("COMEX/NYMEX"), and the Shanghai Futures Exchange ("SHFE"). 
According to the United States Geological Survey ("USGS"), the top global primary copper producers in 2016 were Chile, Peru, China, the United States, and Australia. In 2016, the U.S. had 24 mines that recovered copper with the top copper producing states being Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, and Montana. In addition, in 2016, the U.S. had three primary smelters, three electrolytic and four fire refineries, and fifteen electrowinning facilities that operated. According to Mining.com, the top copper producing companies globally are Codelco, Freeport-McMoRan, Glencore International, BHP Billiton, and Southern Copper. In addition to primary mining, recycling is also a significant source of copper, and recycled copper is indistinguishable from primary copper ("ICSG"). According to Investopedia, the price of copper is driven by a number of factors including strength and weakness in the U.S. dollar, oil prices, global demand, including China, the cost of production, labor relations, natural disasters/phenomena, and geopolitical events. The spot price of copper rose by approximately 28% during 2018 (London Metal Exchange). According to Goldman Sachs, the price of copper rose in 2018 primarily due to currency effects, global growth, and demand factors. Copper prices are currently at $3.08 per pound. 
Competition
The uranium industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with mining and exploration companies for uranium sales, the acquisition of uranium mineral properties, and the procurement of equipment, materials and personnel necessary to explore, develop, and extract uranium from such properties. There is competition for a limited number of uranium acquisition opportunities, including competition with other companies having substantially greater financial resources, staff and facilities than the Company. As a result, the Company may encounter challenges in acquiring attractive properties, and exploring and advancing properties currently in the Company’s portfolio. In addition, Energy Fuels competes with other uranium recovery companies, along with traders, brokers, financial institutions, converters, enrichers, and other market actors, including some that are state-owned and state-subsidized, for uranium sales. Due to the Company’s limited capital and personnel and the relative size of its operations, the Company may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to some other companies with regards to exploration and, if warranted, development of mining properties and securing uranium sales. The Company believes that competition for acquiring mineral prospects and completing uranium sales will continue to be intense in the future.
The availability of funds for exploration, evaluation, permitting and construction of uranium projects is limited, and the Company may find it difficult to compete with larger and more established uranium exploration and production companies for capital. The Company’s inability to continue exploration, advancement, and the acquisition of new properties due to lack of funding could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future operations and financial position.
Government Regulation
The Company’s properties and facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations which are overseen and enforced by multiple federal, state and local authorities. These laws govern exploration, construction, extraction, recovery, processing, exports, various taxes, labor standards, occupational health and safety, waste disposal, protection and remediation of the environment, protection of endangered and protected species, toxic and hazardous substances, and other matters. Uranium minerals exploration, extraction, recovery, and processing are also subject to risks and liabilities associated with the perceived potential for pollution of the environment and disposal of waste products occurring as a result of such activities.
Compliance with these laws and regulations may impose substantial costs on the Company and will subject the Company to significant potential liabilities. Changes in these regulations could require the Company to expend significant resources to comply with new laws or regulations or changes to current requirements and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business operations.

Environmental Regulations
Exploration, development, and extraction activities are subject to certain environmental regulations which may prevent or delay the continuance of our activities. In general, our exploration, evaluation, and extraction activities are subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation. Specifically, we are subject to legislation regarding emissions into the environment, water discharges, and storage and disposition of hazardous wastes. In addition, legislation has been enacted which requires facility sites to be reclaimed in accordance with such legislation. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our operations or financial condition to date.
Uranium milling in the U.S. is primarily regulated by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the “NRC”) pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Its primary function is to ensure the protection of employees, the public, and the environment from radioactive materials, and it also regulates most aspects of the uranium recovery process. The NRC regulations pertaining to uranium recovery facilities are codified in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
On August 16, 2004, the State of Utah became an Agreement State for the regulation of uranium mills. This means that the primary regulator for the White Mesa Mill is now the State of Utah Department of Environmental Quality (“UDEQ”) rather than the NRC. At that time, the Mill’s NRC Source Material License was transferred to the State of Utah and became a Radioactive Materials License, which was recently renewed in January 2018. The State of Utah incorporates, through its own regulations or by reference, all aspects of Title 10 pertaining to uranium recovery facilities. When the State of Utah became an Agreement State, it required that a Groundwater Discharge Permit (“GWDP”) be put in place for the White Mesa Mill. The GWDP is required for all similar facilities in the State of Utah, and specifically tailors the implementation of the state groundwater regulations to the Mill site. The State of Utah requires that every operating uranium mill have a GWDP, regardless of whether the facility discharges to groundwater. The GWDP for the Mill was finalized and implemented in March 2005, then renewed in January 2018 and reissued as Amendment 8 (Renewal) on February 16, 2018. The White Mesa Mill also maintains a permit approval for air emissions with the UDEQ, Division of Air Quality.
Conventional uranium extraction is subject to regulation by a number of agencies including: (1) local county and municipal government agencies; (2) the applicable state divisions responsible for mining and protecting the environment within Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming; (3) the BLM and the United States Forest Service (the “USFS”) on public lands under their jurisdiction; (4) the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”); (5) the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) for radon emissions from underground mines; and (6) other federal agencies (e.g., U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corp. of Engineers, and DOE), where certain conditions exist. In addition, a uranium processing facility at the Sheep Mountain Project will be subject to regulation under the NRC, as a uranium processing facility and for permanent disposal of the resulting tailings.
The provisions of the Atomic Energy Act and its regulations that are applicable to uranium milling also apply to our ISR facilities in Wyoming and Texas. The Nichols Ranch Project and the Alta Mesa Project each have a Source Material License. The Nichols Ranch Source Material License was originally issued by the NRC; however, the State of Wyoming became an NRC Agreement State on September 30, 2018 and the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (“WDEQ”) - Land Quality Division (“WDEQ-LQD”) subsequently assumed all management and oversight functions. Texas, an NRC Agreement State since 1963, issued the Alta Mesa Source Material License through its Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”). ISR facilities are also regulated by the State of Wyoming and State of Texas, respectively, and the EPA under the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In addition, ISR wellfields require an Underground Injection Control Permit under the Safe Drinking Water Act, as administered by the EPA. ISR operations are subject to regulations by the U.S. Occupational, Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), rather than MSHA.
Reclamation bonds or the equivalent have been posted for each of the Company’s material properties that have structures or facilities. Energy Fuels is required to have export licenses issued by the NRC for its uranium exports. Such licenses are obtained by the Company as required.
Land Tenure
The Company’s land holdings are held either by leases from the fee simple owners (private parties or the State) or unpatented mining claims located on property owned and managed by the U.S. Federal Government. Annual fees must be paid to maintain unpatented mining claims, but work expenditures are not required. Holders of unpatented mining claims are generally granted surface access to conduct mineral exploration and extraction activities. However, additional permits and plans are generally required prior to conducting exploration or mining activities on such claims.
On July 9, 2009, BLM issued a Notice of Proposed Withdrawal (“2009 Notice”) under which it proposed that a total of approximately one million acres of public lands around the Grand Canyon National Park be withdrawn from location and entry under the Mining Law of 1872 (the “Mining Law”), subject to valid existing rights. In the 2009 Notice, BLM stated that the purpose of the withdrawal, 
21

if determined to be appropriate, would be to protect the Grand Canyon watershed from any adverse effects of locatable hardrock mineral exploration and mining. The 2009 Notice segregated the lands from location and entry under the mining laws for up to two years to allow time for various studies and analyses, including appropriate NEPA analysis. In order to allow more time for BLM to complete its NEPA analysis, the U.S. Department of the Interior (the “DOI”) published Public Land Order 7773 on June 21, 2011, which effected a six-month emergency withdrawal of the area. The emergency withdrawal prevented the lands from being open to location and entry under the Mining Law upon expiration of the two-year segregation while the DOI completed the decision–making process on the proposed withdrawal. The emergency withdrawal was effective from July 21, 2011 to January 20, 2012. During the two-year segregation and six-month emergency withdrawal, the BLM, along with its cooperating agencies, completed various studies and analyses of resources in the withdrawal area, including an Environmental Impact Statement ("EIS") under the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"). These studies and analyses were undertaken to provide the basis for the final decision regarding whether to proceed with the proposed withdrawal or to select an alternative action. Based on this analysis, on January 9, 2012, the DOI announced its final decision to withdraw from location and entry under the Mining Law, subject to valid existing rights, the total of approximately one million acres of lands originally proposed in the 2009 Notice (the “Withdrawn Lands”), for a 20-year period. Lawsuits challenging this decision were filed by various industry groups and interested parties.
As a result of the 2009 withdrawal from location and entry, no new mining claims may be staked on the Withdrawn Lands and no new Plans of Operations may be approved, other than Plans of Operations on mining claims that were valid at the time of withdrawal and that remain valid at the time of plan approval. Case law indicates that a miner establishes valid Congressionally provided rights under the Mining Law through certain unilateral acts, and that such acts are presumptively recognized as valid claims in which the holder has valid existing rights unless and until the DOI or U.S. Federal Courts declare otherwise. However, the Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”) and U.S. Forest Service (“USFS”), each at their discretion, may perform a mineral examination and Mineral Report, which involves an economic evaluation of a project, in order to reflect an agency’s belief about certain mining claims that may be used in support of a future mining claim contest on the validity of existing rights. All the Company’s properties located on the Arizona Strip, with the exception of its Wate property and certain exploration properties held by the Company’s subsidiary, Arizona Strip Partners LLC, are located within the Withdrawn Lands. A mineral examination on the Company’s EZ Project will need to be completed by BLM, in conjunction with its review of the Company’s proposed Plan of Operations for that project. Mineral examinations were not required for the Company’s Arizona 1 and Pinenut projects, which had previously approved Plans of Operations and were previously active. Although the Company’s Canyon Project also has an approved Plan of Operations, and a mineral examination is not required, the USFS voluntarily performed a mineral examination on that project in 2012 in order to clarify the agency’s own position on the underlying claims and concluded that the Canyon Project’s claims constituted valid existing rights. The USFS also concluded that no additional approvals were required on the Canyon Project that would trigger any further NEPA analysis as a major federal action.
The Company believes that all its material projects within the Withdrawn Lands are on valid mining claims that will each withstand a mineral examination. However, market conditions may postpone or prevent the performance of mineral examinations on certain properties and, if a mineral examination is performed on a property, there can be no guarantee that the mineral examination would not result in one of more of the Company’s mining claims being deemed invalid, which could prevent a project from proceeding.
President Obama additionally designated the Bears Ears National Monument by executive order in December of 2016, which comprised 1.35 million acres of land in San Juan County, Utah. The designated land included a portion of the County road which the Company relies on for access to its Daneros Project as well as abutted a portion of the property boundary of the White Mesa Mill and encompassed two water sampling sites the Company monitors for the Mill. In December 2017, President Trump issued a Proclamation that amended President Obama’s 2016 Proclamation and reduced the monument to two parcels encompassing a total of 201,876 acres, releasing 1.15 million acres. That Proclamation has been challenged in Federal Court. The closest boundaries of the reduced monument to any of the Company’s operations are respectively approximately 6 miles from the White Mesa Mill and approximately 15 miles from the Daneros Project. It is possible that the Daneros Project and/or the White Mesa Mill could become subject to additional requirements, restrictions and costs if the original designation is upheld in Court.
Employees
As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company and its subsidiaries have approximately 104 full-time employees. We operate in established mining areas where we have found sufficient available personnel for our business plans.
