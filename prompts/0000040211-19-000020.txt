RAIL NORTH AMERICA
Rail North America is composed of our operations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Rail North America primarily provides railcars pursuant to full-service leases under which it maintains the railcars, pays ad valorem taxes and insurance, and provides other ancillary services. These railcars have estimated useful economic lives of 27 to 45 years and an average age of approximately 20 years. Rail North America has a large and diverse customer base, serving approximately 860 customers. In 2018, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of Rail North America’s total lease revenue, and the top ten customers combined accounted for approximately 18% of Rail North America’s total lease revenue. Rail North America leases railcars for terms that generally range from one to ten years, which vary based on railcar types and market conditions. The average remaining lease term of the North American fleet was approximately 40 months as of December 31, 2018. Rail North America’s primary competitors are Union Tank Car Company, Wells Fargo Rail, the CIT Group, Trinity Industries Leasing Company, SMBC Rail Services, LLC, the Andersons Rail Group, and American Railcar Industries, Inc. Rail North America competes primarily on the basis of lease rate, maintenance capabilities, customer relationships, engineering expertise, and availability of railcars. 
Rail North America purchases new railcars from a number of manufacturers, including Trinity Rail Group, LLC, American Railcar Industries, Inc., National Steel Car Ltd., and Freightcar America. We also acquire railcars in the secondary market. In 2014, we entered into a long-term supply agreement with Trinity Rail Group, LLC ("Trinity") a subsidiary of Trinity Industries. Under the terms of that agreement, we agreed to order 8,950 newly built railcars over a four-year period from March, 2016 through March, 2020. We may order either tank or freight cars; however, we expect that the majority of the order will be for tank cars. As of December 31, 2018, 7,992 railcars have been ordered, of which 5,670 railcars have been delivered. On May 24, 2018, we amended our long-term supply agreement with Trinity to extend the term to December 2023. We agreed to purchase an additional 4,800 tank cars (1,200 per year) beginning in January 2020 and continuing through the expiration of the extended term.
On July 30, 2018, we entered into a multi-year railcar supply agreement with American Railcar Industries, Inc., pursuant to which we will purchase 7,650 newly built railcars. The order encompasses a mix of tank and freight cars that are to be delivered over a five-year period, beginning in April 2019. Under the terms of this agreement, ARI will deliver 450 railcars in 2019, with the remaining 7,200 to be delivered ratably over the four-year period of 2020 to 2023. The agreement also includes an option to order up to an additional 4,400 railcars subject to certain restrictions.
On November 12, 2018, we entered into an agreement to purchase a fleet of up to 3,100 railcars from ECN Capital Corporation. As of December 31, 2018, we had acquired 2,832 railcars, with the balance to be acquired in early 2019. 
Rail North America also owns a fleet of locomotives, consisting of 644 four-axle and 36 six-axle locomotives as of December 31, 2018. Locomotive customers are primarily regional and short-line railroads, industrial users, and Class I railroads. Lease terms vary from month-to-month to ten years. As of December 31, 2018, the average remaining lease term of the locomotive fleet was approximately two years. Rail North America's primary competitors in locomotive leasing are Wells Fargo Rail, CIT Group Inc., and Progress Rail Services Corporation. Competitive factors in the market include lease rates, customer service, maintenance, and availability. 
Rail North America also remarkets its rail assets, and such remarketing activities generate gains which may contribute significantly to Rail North America’s segment profit.

Maintenance
Rail North America operates an extensive network of maintenance facilities in the United States and Canada dedicated to performing safe, timely, efficient, and high-quality railcar maintenance services for customers. Services include interior cleaning of railcars, routine maintenance and general repairs to the car body and safety appliances, regulatory compliance work, wheelset replacements, interior blast and lining, exterior blast and painting, and car stenciling. To the extent possible, railcar maintenance is scheduled in a manner that minimizes the amount of time the car is out of service. At December 31, 2018, Rail North America’s maintenance network consisted of: 

• | Six major maintenance facilities that can complete all types of maintenance services.


• | Four maintenance facilities that primarily focus on routine cleaning, repair, and regulatory compliance services.


• | Five customer-dedicated sites operating within specific customer facilities that offer services tailored to the needs of our customers’ fleets.


• | Fifteen locations with mobile units that travel to many track-side field locations to provide spot repairs and interior cleaning services, thus avoiding the need to send a railcar to a major maintenance facility. Eleven of these locations operate as independent maintenance repair units that are not affiliated with physical locations.

The maintenance network is supplemented by a number of preferred third-party maintenance providers. In certain cases, we have entered into fixed-capacity contracts with these third parties under which Rail North America has secured access to maintenance capacity. In 2018, wholly owned and third-party maintenance facilities performed approximately 55,000 service events, including multiple independent service events for the same car. In 2018, third-party maintenance network expenses accounted for approximately 25% of Rail North America’s total maintenance network expenses (excluding repairs performed by railroads). Approximately 75% of the maintenance hours, incurred for our tank cars and specialty freight cars during 2018, were performed internally at our own maintenance facilities.
Our maintenance activities are substantially dedicated to servicing our wholly owned railcar fleet pursuant to the provisions of our lease contracts. Additionally, our customers periodically utilize our services that are not included in the full-service lease agreement, such as repairs of railcar damage or other customer-specific requirements. Revenue earned from these types of maintenance services is recorded in other revenue.
Affiliates
Adler Funding LLC ("Adler") is a 12.5% owned railcar leasing partnership that was formed in 2010 with UniCredit Bank AG, Sperber Rail Holdings Inc., and LBT Holding Corporation. Rail North America has provided leasing, maintenance and asset remarketing services to Adler, for which it received a base service fee and a performance-based asset remarketing fee. As of December 31, 2018, all railcar assets have been sold, and the partnership is in the process of winding down remaining activities.
RAIL INTERNATIONAL
Rail International is composed of our operations in Europe ("GATX Rail Europe" or "GRE"), India ("Rail India"), and Russia ("Rail Russia"). GRE leases railcars to customers throughout Europe pursuant to full-service leases under which it maintains the railcars and provides value-adding services according to customer requirements. These railcars have estimated useful lives of 30 to 40 years and an average age of approximately 18 years. GRE has a diverse customer base with approximately 210 customers. In 2018, two customers each accounted for more than 10% of GRE's total lease revenue and the top ten customers combined accounted for approximately 60% of GRE's total lease revenue. GRE's lease terms generally range from one to ten years and as of December 31, 2018, the average remaining lease term of the European fleet was approximately 21 months. GRE competes principally on the basis of customer relationships, lease rate, maintenance expertise, and availability of railcars. Its primary competitors are VTG Aktiengesellschaft, the Ermewa Group, Nacco, Wascosa AG, and On Rail.
GRE acquires new railcars primarily from Greenbrier-Astra Rail (Wagony Swidnica sp. z.o.o and Astra Rail Industries S.A.), Tatravagónka a.s., and Legios Loco a.s. Additionally, GRE's Ostróda, Poland maintenance facility assembles several hundred tank cars each year. As of December 31, 2018, GRE had commitments to acquire approximately 1,500 newly manufactured railcars to be delivered 
5

in 2019, primarily from Tatravagónka a.s., and Greenbrier. The majority of the railcars to be delivered in 2019 have committed leases in place with customers.
Rail India began operations in 2012 as the first company registered to lease railcars under the Indian Railways Wagon Leasing Scheme. As of December 31, 2018, Rail India owned 2,053 railcars with estimated useful lives of 20-25 years. Rail India's leases are net leases and have terms generally ranging from three to 12 years. As of December 31, 2018, the average remaining lease term of the Indian fleet was approximately six years. Rail India has a small customer base with approximately ten customers in the container, steel and automotive transport sector, as well as the public sector. As of December 31, 2018, Rail India had entered into contracts to acquire approximately 1,100 railcars to be delivered in 2019, all of which have committed leases in place with customers.
As of December 31, 2018, Rail Russia owned 354 railcars and had commitments to acquire 26 railcars to be delivered in 2019, all of which have committed leases in place with customers.
Maintenance
As of December 31, 2018, GRE operates a maintenance facility in Ostróda, Poland. In the second quarter of 2018, GRE closed its railcar maintenance facility in Hannover, Germany. The maintenance facility in Ostróda, Poland performs significant repairs, regulatory compliance and modernization work for owned railcars, and assembles railcars. This service center is supplemented by a number of third-party repair facilities, which in 2018 accounted for approximately 42% of GRE's fleet repair costs.
Similar to our Rail North America segment, GRE's customers periodically require maintenance services that are not included in the full-service lease agreement. These services are generally related to the repair of railcar damage caused by customers and railways. Revenue earned from these maintenance activities is recorded in other revenue.
In India, all railcar maintenance is performed by Indian Railways or third-parties authorized by Indian Railways, in accordance with regulatory requirements.
In Russia, all railcar maintenance is performed by third-party repair facilities either owned or authorized by Russian Railways, in accordance with regulatory requirements.
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
Portfolio Management is composed primarily of our ownership in a group of joint ventures with Rolls-Royce plc that lease aircraft spare engines, as well as five liquefied gas-carrying vessels (the "Norgas Vessels"). In prior years, Portfolio Management generated leasing, marine operating, asset remarketing, and management fee income through a collection of diversified wholly owned assets and joint venture investments. In 2015, we made the decision to exit the majority of these ancillary investments, including six chemical parcel tankers, a number of inland marine vessels, and our 50% interest in the Cardinal Marine joint venture. These investments were all sold as of December 31, 2017. See the Portfolio Management section in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further details.

Affiliates
The Rolls-Royce & Partners Finance companies (collectively the “RRPF affiliates”) are a group of seventeen 50% owned domestic and foreign joint ventures with Rolls-Royce plc (or affiliates thereof, collectively “Rolls-Royce”), a leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft jet engines. The RRPF affiliates are primarily engaged in two business activities: lease financing of aircraft spare engines to a diverse group of commercial aircraft operators worldwide and sale-leaseback financing of aircraft spare engines to Rolls-Royce for use in their engine maintenance programs. As of December 31, 2018, the RRPF affiliates, in aggregate, owned 452 engines, of which 253 were on lease to Rolls-Royce. Aircraft engines generally have an estimated economic useful life of 25 years when new and, depending on actual hours of usage and with proper maintenance, may achieve extended service well beyond the useful life estimates. As of December 31, 2018, the average age of these engines was approximately 11 years. Lease terms vary but typically range from 3 to 12 years. Rolls-Royce acts as manager for each of the RRPF affiliates and also performs substantially all required maintenance activities.
Owned and Managed Assets
Historically, Portfolio Management's wholly owned portfolio consisted of marine assets operating in pooling arrangements, assets subject to operating and finance leases, and secured loans. As of December 31, 2018, Portfolio Management's remaining owned assets consisted primarily of the Norgas Vessels operating under a pooling arrangement. The Norgas Vessels specialize in the transport of pressurized gases and chemicals, such as liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas, and ethylene, primarily on shorter-term spot contracts for major oil and chemical customers worldwide.
Portfolio Management also manages portfolios of assets for third parties which generate fee and residual sharing income through portfolio administration and the remarketing of these assets. As of December 31, 2018, Portfolio Management's managed activities consisted primarily of managing leases of three power plants.
ASC
ASC operates the largest fleet of U.S.-flagged vessels on the Great Lakes, providing waterborne transportation of dry bulk commodities such as iron ore, coal, limestone aggregates, and metallurgical limestone. End markets served include steel making, domestic automobile manufacturing, electricity generation, and non-residential construction. Customer service, primarily in the form of scheduling flexibility, vessel availability, reliability, and operating safety, is key to ASC’s success. ASC’s sailing season generally runs from April 1 through December 31; however, depending on customer demand and weather conditions, vessels may commence operations in March and continue to operate into January of the following year.
At December 31, 2018, ASC’s fleet consisted of 12 vessels with a net book value of $257.0 million. All vessels are compliant with applicable regulatory guidelines. The vessels are diesel powered, with an average age of 41 years and estimated useful lives of 65 years. For 2019, 11 of ASC’s vessels are generally available for both service contracts and spot business; the remaining vessel is dedicated to a time charter agreement that is scheduled to expire following the 2021 sailing season. ASC’s vessels operate exclusively in the fresh water of the Great Lakes and as a result, with proper maintenance and periodic refurbishment, may achieve extended service well beyond the useful life estimates. 
All of ASC’s vessels are equipped with self-unloading equipment, enabling them to discharge dry bulk cargo without shore-side assistance. This equipment enables the vessels to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. ASC’s vessels are capable of transporting 
7

and unloading almost any free flowing, dry bulk commodity. In 2018, ASC served 21 customers, with the top five customers accounting for 88% of total revenue. 
The following table sets forth ASC's fleet as of December 31, 2018:

Great Lakes Vessels | Length (feet) | Capacity (gross tons)
M/V American Spirit | 1004' | 62,400 
M/V Burns Harbor | 1000' | 80,900 
M/V Indiana Harbor | 1000' | 80,900 
M/V Walter J. McCarthy, Jr | 1000' | 80,900 
M/V American Century | 1000' | 78,850 
M/V American Integrity | 1000' | 78,850 
M/V St. Clair | 770' | 44,800 
M/V American Mariner | 730' | 37,300 
M/V H. Lee White | 704' | 35,400 
M/V John J. Boland | 680' | 34,000 
M/V Sam Laud | 634'-10" | 24,300 
M/V American Courage | 634'-10" | 23,800 

ASC’s vessels operate pursuant to customer contracts that stipulate freight volume commitments and may also be supplemented with additional spot volume opportunities. In 2018, ASC operated 11 vessels and carried 26.2 million net tons of cargo. The number of vessels deployed by ASC in any given year is dependent on customer volume requirements.
ASC’s primary competitors on the Great Lakes are Interlake Steamship Company, Great Lakes Fleet, Inc., Grand River Navigation, Central Marine Logistics, and VanEnkevort Tug and Barge. ASC principally competes on the basis of service capabilities, customer relationships, and price.
The United States shipping industry is subject to the Jones Act, which requires all commercial vessels transporting goods between U.S. ports to be built, owned, operated and manned by U.S. citizens, and registered under the U.S. flag.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS
Patents, trademarks, and licenses are not material to our businesses taken as a whole.
SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS 
ASC’s fleet is inactive for a significant portion of the first quarter of each year due to the winter conditions on the Great Lakes.
CUSTOMER BASE
GATX, taken as a whole, is not dependent upon a single customer nor does it have any significant customer concentrations. Segment concentrations, if material, are described above.
See "Note 13. Concentrations" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONS 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 2,225 persons, of whom approximately 42% were union workers covered by collective bargaining agreements.
See "Note 13. Concentrations" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our employees and concentration of labor force.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Our operations, facilities and properties are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws cover discharges to waters; air emissions; toxic substances; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and hazardous materials; and the investigation and remediation of contamination. These laws have the effect of increasing the cost and liability associated with leasing and operating assets, and violations can result in significant fines, penalties, or other liabilities. Environmental risks and compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations are inherent in rail and marine operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials.
We are subject to, and may from time to time continue to be subject to, environmental cleanup and enforcement actions in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we operate. In particular, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, generally imposes joint and several liability for investigation, cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Accordingly, we have been and may, in the future, be named as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA and other federal, state, local, and foreign laws or regulations for all or a portion of the costs to investigate and clean up sites at which certain contaminants may have been discharged or released by us, our current lessees, former owners or lessees of properties, or other third parties. Environmental remediation and other environmental costs are accrued when considered probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2018, environmental costs were not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For further discussion, see "Note 22. Legal Proceedings and Other Contingencies" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
