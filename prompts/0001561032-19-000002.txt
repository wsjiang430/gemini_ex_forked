Item 1. Business
We invest in healthcare real estate, focusing on seniors housing properties and medical office buildings ("MOB"), located in the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 191 properties located in 31 states and comprised of 9.1 million rentable square feet.
We were incorporated on October 15, 2012 as a Maryland corporation that elected to be taxed as a REIT beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Substantially all of our business is conducted through Healthcare Trust Operating Partnership, L.P. (our "OP").
In February 2013, we commenced our initial public offering ("IPO") on a "reasonable best efforts" basis of up to $1.7 billion of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at a price of $25.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts. We closed our IPO in November 2014 and as of such date we had received cumulative proceeds of $2.0 billion from our IPO. As of December 31, 2018, we have received total proceeds of $2.3 billion, net of shares repurchased under the SRP (see Note 8 — Common Stock to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and including $292.0 million in proceeds received under the DRIP.
On April 3, 2018, we published a new estimate of per share asset value ("Estimated Per-Share NAV") equal to $20.25 as of December 31, 2017. Our previous Estimated Per-Share NAV was equal to $21.45 as of December 31, 2016. We intend to publish Estimated Per-Share NAV periodically at the discretion of the Board, provided that such estimates will be made at least once annually.
We have no employees. The Advisor has been retained by us to manage our affairs on a day-to-day basis. We have retained the Healthcare Trust Properties, LLC (the "Property Manager") to serve as our property manager. The Advisor and Property Manager are under common control with AR Global, and these related parties receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for services related to managing our business and investments. Healthcare Trust Special Limited Partnership, LLC (the "Special Limited Partner"), which is also under common control with AR Global, also has an interest in us through ownership of interests in our OP.
On December 22, 2017, we purchased all of the membership interests in indirect subsidiaries of American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust III, Inc. (“HT III”) that own the 19 properties which comprised substantially all of HT III’s assets (the “Asset Purchase”), pursuant to a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated as of June 16, 2017. HT III was sponsored and advised by an affiliate of our Advisor.

(1) | Annualized rental income on a straight-line basis for the leases in place in the property portfolio as of December 31, 2018, which includes tenant concessions such as free rent, as applicable, as well as gross revenue from our SHOPs (as defined below).

Business Strategy
We seek to protect and enhance long-term stockholder value by creating stable, reliable and growing income streams generated through the ownership of a balanced and diversified portfolio of healthcare real estate. Our investment strategy is guided by three core principles: (1) maintaining a balanced, well-diversified portfolio of high quality assets; (2) pursuing accretive and opportunistic investment opportunities; and (3) maintaining a strong and flexible capital structure.
We have invested, and expect to continue investing, primarily in MOBs and seniors housing properties. In addition, we may invest in facilities leased to hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, long-term acute care centers, surgery centers, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, special medical and diagnostic service providers, laboratories, research firms, pharmaceutical and medical supply manufacturers and health insurance firms. While we may invest in facilities across the healthcare continuum, our primary investment focus going forward is MOBs and Seniors Housing — Operating Properties ("SHOP"). Our SHOP investments are held through a structure permitted under the provisions of RIDEA (as defined below). We generally acquire a fee interest in any property we acquire (a "fee interest" is the absolute, legal possession and ownership of land, property, or rights), although we may also acquire a leasehold interest (a "leasehold interest" is a right to enjoy the exclusive possession and use of an asset or property for a stated definite period as created by a written lease). We have and may continue to acquire properties through a joint venture or the acquisition of substantially all of the interests of an entity which in turn owns the real property. We also may make preferred equity investments in an entity.
We have, and may in the future, enter into management agreements with healthcare operators to manage communities that are placed in a structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification Empowerment Act of 2007 ("RIDEA"). Under the provisions of RIDEA, a REIT may lease "qualified healthcare properties" on an arm's length basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an "eligible independent contractor." We view RIDEA as a structure primarily to be used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points with long term growth prospects or drive growth by: (i) transitioning the asset to a new operator that can bring scale, operating efficiencies, or ancillary services; or (ii) investing capital to reposition the asset.
A smaller part of our business may involve originating or acquiring loans secured by or related to the same types of properties in which we may invest directly. Likewise, we may invest in securities of publicly-traded and private companies primarily engaged in real estate businesses, including REITs and other real estate operating companies, and securities issued by pass-through entities of which substantially all of the assets consist of qualifying assets or real estate-related assets. For example, we may purchase the common stock, preferred stock, debt, or other securities of these entities or options to acquire these securities. Examples of loans we may invest in include, but are not limited to, investments in first, second and third mortgage loans, wraparound mortgage loans, construction mortgage loans on real property and loans on leasehold interest mortgages. We also may invest in participations in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans unsecured loans.
Maintaining a Balanced, Well Diversified Portfolio of High Quality Assets
We seek balance and diversity within our portfolio. This extends to the mix of tenancy, geography, operator/managers and payors within our facilities.

As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, none of our tenants (together with their affiliates) had annualized rental income on a straight-line basis representing 10% or greater of total annualized rental income on a straight-line basis for the portfolio.

Georgia | 10.1% | 10.7% | 10.2%
Iowa | * | * | 10.5%
Michigan | 13.1% | 11.6% | * 
Pennsylvania | 10.2% | 10.8% | 12.0%

_______________

* | State's annualized rental income on a straight-line basis was not greater than 10% of total annualized rental income on a straight-line basis for all portfolio properties as of the period specified.

Investing in Healthcare-related Facilities
Healthcare-related facilities include MOBs and outpatient facilities, seniors housing properties, such as assisted and independent living and memory care facilities, as well as hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, long-term acute care centers, surgery centers, skilled nursing facilities, specialty medical and diagnostic facilities, research laboratories and pharmaceutical buildings. While we may invest in facilities across the healthcare continuum, our primary investment focus going forward is MOBs and SHOPs.
Medical Office Building and Outpatient Facilities 
As of December 31, 2018, we owned 111 MOBs and outpatient facilities totaling 3.9 million square feet. These facilities typically contain physicians' offices and examination rooms, and may also include pharmacies, hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services such as diagnostic imaging centers, rehabilitation clinics and ambulatory surgery centers. These facilities can be located on or near hospital campuses and require significant plumbing, electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate diagnostic imaging equipment such as x-rays or other imaging equipment, and may also have significant plumbing to accommodate physician exam rooms. In addition, MOBs are often built to accommodate higher structural loads for certain equipment and may contain specialized construction such as cancer radiation therapy vaults for cancer treatment. 
There are a variety of types of MOBs: on campus, off campus, affiliated and non-affiliated. On campus MOBs are physically located on a hospital's campus, often on land leased from the hospital. A hospital typically creates strong tenant demand which leads to high tenant retention. Off campus properties are located independent of a hospital's location. Affiliated MOBs may be located on campus or off campus, but are affiliated with a hospital or health system. In some respects, affiliated MOBs are similar to on campus MOBs because the hospital relationship drives tenant demand and retention. Finally, non-affiliated MOBs are not affiliated with any hospital or health system, but may contain physician offices and other healthcare services. We favor affiliated MOBs versus non-affiliated MOBs because of the relationship and synergy with the sponsoring hospital or health system and buildings not affiliated with the hospital or health system but anchored or entirely occupied by a long-tenured physician practice. 
The following table reflects the on campus, off campus, affiliated and non-affiliated MOB composition of our portfolio as of December 31, 2018:

MOB Classification | Number of Buildings | Rentable Square Feet
On Campus | 21 | | 1,248,668
Off Campus | 90 | | 2,637,533
Total | 111 | | 3,886,201
Affiliated | 84 | | 3,141,339
Non-affiliated | 27 | | 744,862 
Total | 111 | | 3,886,201

Seniors Housing Properties 
As of December 31, 2018, we owned 58 seniors housing properties under a structure permitted by RIDEA, our SHOP segment, and four seniors housing properties under long term leases, which are included within our triple net leased healthcare facilities segment. Under RIDEA, a REIT may lease qualified healthcare properties on an arm's length basis to a TRS if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an eligible independent contractor. Seniors housing properties primarily consist of independent living facilities, assisted living facilities and memory care facilities. These facilities cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs and need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Services provided by our operators or tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.
Assisted Living and Memory Care Facilities
Assisted living facilities are licensed care facilities that provide personal care services, support and housing for those who need help with activities of daily living, such as bathing, eating and dressing, yet require limited medical care. The programs and services may include transportation, social activities, exercise and fitness programs, beauty or barber shop access, hobby and craft activities, community excursions, meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents. ALFs are often in apartment-like buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments. Certain ALFs may offer a separate facility that provides a higher level of care for residents requiring memory care as a result of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. Levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations. As of December 31, 2018, our seniors housing properties included approximately 2,425 assisted living units and 1,139 memory care units.
Independent Living Facilities 
Independent living facilities are designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded by their peers with services such as housekeeping, meals and activities. These residents generally do not need assistance with activities of daily living, however, in some of our facilities, residents have the option to contract for these services. As of December 31, 2018, our seniors housing properties included 1,012 independent living units. However, independent living facilities on their own are not treated as qualified health care properties eligible to be held through a RIDEA structure.
Hospitals, Post-Acute Care and Other Facilities 
Our hospitals, post-acute care and other facilities are leased to tenants that provide healthcare services. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 18 other healthcare-related assets, including hospitals and post-acute care facilities. Hospitals can include general acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, long-term acute care hospitals and surgical and specialty hospitals. These facilities provide inpatient diagnosis and treatment, both medical and surgical, and provide a broad array of inpatient and outpatient services including surgery, rehabilitation therapy as well as diagnostic and treatment services. Post-acute facilities offer restorative, rehabilitative and custodial care for people not requiring the more extensive and complex treatment available at acute care hospitals. Ancillary revenues and revenues from sub-acute care services are derived from providing services beyond room and board and include occupational, physical, speech, respiratory and intravenous therapy, wound care, oncology treatment, brain injury care and orthopedic therapy, as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other services. Certain facilities provide some of the foregoing services on an outpatient basis. Inpatient rehabilitation services provided by our operators and tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for by private sources or through the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Healthcare Industry
Healthcare is the single largest industry in the United States based on Gross Domestic Product ("GDP"). According to the National Health Expenditures Projections, 2018 - 2027 report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"): (i) national health expenditures are projected to grow 4.8% in 2019 and at an average annual growth rate of 5.5% for 2018 through 2027 and (ii) the healthcare industry is projected to increase from 17.9% of U.S. GDP in 2017 to 19.4% by 2027. This growth in expenditures is projected to lead to significant growth in healthcare employment. According to the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, the healthcare industry was one of the largest industries in the United States, providing approximately 20.2 million seasonally adjusted jobs as of December 31, 2018. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of healthcare occupations (healthcare practitioners and technical occupations and healthcare support) is projected to grow 18% from 2016 to 2026, adding approximately 2.4 million new jobs. This growth is expected due to an aging population and the projected increase in the number of individuals who have access to health insurance. We believe that the continued growth in employment in the healthcare industry will lead to growth in demand for medical office buildings and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry.
8

In addition to the growth in national health expenditures and corresponding increases in employment in the healthcare sector, the nature of healthcare delivery continues to evolve due to the impact of government programs, regulatory changes and consumer preferences. We believe these changes have increased the need for capital among healthcare providers and increased incentives for these providers to develop more efficient real estate solutions in order to enhance the delivery of quality healthcare. In particular, we believe the following demographic factors and trends are creating an attractive environment in which to invest in healthcare properties.
Demographics
The aging of the U.S. population has a direct effect on the demand for healthcare as older persons generally utilize healthcare services at a rate well in excess of younger people. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the "CDC"), 6.9% of all adults aged 65 years and over during the first half of 2018 needed help with personal care from another person. For both sexes combined, adults aged 85 years and over (19.6%) were nearly three times as likely as adults aged 75 to 84 (8.7%) to need help with personal care from other persons; adults aged 85 and over were nearly six times as likely as adults aged 65 to 74 (3.7%) to need help with personal care from other persons.  Also, according to the CDC, symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease generally do not appear until after the age of 60. Starting at age 65, the risk of developing the disease doubles every five years, and is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults and the fifth leading cause for those aged 65 or older. Up to 5 million Americans currently have Alzheimer’s disease and by 2060 the number is expected to more than triple to 14 million due to the aging of the population. 
We believe that the aging population, improved chronic disease management, technological advances and healthcare reform will positively affect the demand for medical office buildings, seniors housing properties and other healthcare-related facilities and generate attractive investment opportunities. The first wave of Baby Boomers, the largest segment of the U.S. population, began turning 65 in 2011. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. population over 65 will grow to 1.6 billion in 2050, up from 47 million in 2015. This group will grow more rapidly than the overall population.  Thus, its share of the population will increase to 16.7% in 2050, from 8% in 2015. Patients with diseases that were once life threatening are now being treated with specialized medical care and an arsenal of new pharmaceuticals. Advances in research, diagnostics, surgical procedures, pharmaceuticals and a focus on healthier lifestyles have led to people living longer. Finally, we believe that healthcare reform in the United States will continue to drive an increase in demand for medical services, and in particular, in the post-acute and long term services which our tenants and operators provide.
Pursuing Accretive and Opportunistic Investment Opportunities
Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future which will be accretive to our earnings and will generate attractive returns to our stockholders. We invest in medical office buildings, seniors housing and certain other healthcare real estate primarily through acquisitions, although we may also do so through development and joint venture partnerships. In determining whether to invest in a property, we focus on the following: (1) the experience of the obligor's/partner's management team; (2) the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property; (3) the credit of the obligor/partner; (4) the security for any lease or loan; (5) the real estate attributes of the building, its age and location; (6) the capital committed to the property by the obligor/partner; and (7) the operating fundamentals of the applicable industry. We conduct market research and analysis for all potential investments. In addition, we review the value of all properties, the interest rates and covenant requirements of any facility-level debt to be assumed at the time of the acquisition and the anticipated sources of repayment of any existing debt that is not to be assumed at the time of the acquisition.
We monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our proactive and comprehensive asset management process generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections, and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our Advisor's internal asset managers actively manage and monitor the medical office building portfolio with a comprehensive process including tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs, and market conditions among other things. In monitoring our portfolio, our Advisor's personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze property-specific data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends.
Maintaining a Strong and Flexible Capital Structure
We utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund our investment activity. Our debt and equity levels are determined by management in consultation with the Board. For short-term purposes, we may borrow from our Revolving Credit Facility and our Fannie Mae Master Credit Facilities, which include a secured credit facility (the "KeyBank Facility") with KeyBank together with a secured credit facility (the "Capital One Facility") with Capital One Multifamily Finance, LLC, an affiliate of Capital One (the Capital One Facility and the KeyBank Facility are referred to herein individually as a "Fannie Mae Master Credit Facility" and together as the "Fannie Mae Master Credit Facilities"). On March 13, 2019, we amended and restated our existing senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Prior Credit Facility”), which was scheduled to mature on March 21, 2019, by entering into our New Credit Facility with primarily the same lenders that were lenders under the Prior Credit Facility, with Keybank National Association 
9

remaining as agent for the lenders. Our New Credit Facility consists of two components, the Revolving Credit Facility and our Term Loan. At the closing under our New Credit Facility, we had a total borrowing capacity thereunder of $263.1 million based on the value of the borrowing base thereunder. Of this amount, $233.6 million was outstanding including $150.0 million outstanding under our Term Loan, and $83.6 million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, while $29.5 million remained available for future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Like the Prior Credit Facility, our New Credit Facility is secured by a pledged pool of the equity interests and related rights in wholly owned subsidiaries that directly own or lease the eligible unencumbered real estate assets comprising the borrowing base thereunder. As of December 31, 2018, the Fannie Mae Master Credit Facilities are secured by mortgages on 22 properties, in aggregate. We may seek and even replace current borrowings with longer-term capital such as senior secured or unsecured notes or other forms of long-term financing. We may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness, which we assume as part of the acquisition. In addition, we may obtain financing secured by previously unencumbered properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis. In our agreements with our lenders, we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness, including restrictions on permitted investments, distributions and maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio, among other things. As of December 31, 2018, our total debt leverage ratio (total debt divided by total assets) was approximately 45.2% and we had total borrowings of $1.1 billion.
Tax Status
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Commencing with that taxable year, we have been organized and operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT. In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other things, distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements. If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Even if we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. 
Competition
The market for MOBs, seniors housing and other healthcare-related real estate is highly competitive. We compete in all of our markets based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property's design to prospective tenants' needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties to acquire, tenants to occupy our properties and purchasers to buy our properties. These competitors include other REITs, private investment funds, specialty finance companies, institutional investors, pension funds and their advisors and other entities. There are also other REITs with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours, and others may be organized in the future. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants. In addition, these same entities seek financing through similar channels.
Healthcare Regulation
Overview
The healthcare industry is one of the most regulated industries in the United States and is currently experiencing rapid regulatory change and uncertainty. The legal challenges and legislative initiatives to roll back the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "Affordable Care Act" or "ACA") continue and the outcomes are uncertain. The regulatory uncertainty and the potential impact on our tenants and operators could have an adverse material effect on their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations.
Our tenants and operators must comply with a wide-range of complex federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and the healthcare industry, in general, is the subject to increased enforcement and penalties in all areas. Fraud and abuse continues to be an enforcement priority at both the federal and state levels including, but not limited to, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal Physician Self-Referral Statute (commonly known as the "Stark Law"), the FCA, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law ("CMPL"), and a range of other federal and state regulations relating to waste, cost control, and healthcare management. The business and operations of our tenants and therefore our business could be materially impacted by, among other things, a significant expansion of applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations, continued judicial and legislative changes to the ACA, future attempts to reform healthcare, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, and changes or increased emphasis on certain enforcement priorities.
10

Additionally, the ongoing political and legal challenges to the ACA leave its future uncertain. In December 2018, a Texas federal judge ruled that the ACA's individual mandate violates the Constitution and therefore the entire ACA violates the Constitution. The decision will most likely be appealed. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") responded by clarifying that the US District Court decision did not halt the enforcement of the ACA. The confusion around the state of the ACA, the shift towards less comprehensive health insurance coverage, higher deductibles, and increased consumer cost-sharing on health expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our tenants’ financial conditions and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations.
Our tenants and operators are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws, regulations and industry standards which govern business operations, physical plant and structure, patient and employee health and safety, access to facilities, patient rights - including privacy, price transparency, fewer restrictions on access to care - and security of health information. Our tenants’ and operators’ failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of licensure, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines or other penalties, suspension or exclusion from the government sponsored Medicare and Medicaid programs, loss of accreditation or certification, reputational damage or closure of a facility. In addition, both government and private third-party payors will likely continue their efforts to drive down reimbursement. The Medicare and Medicaid programs have adopted a variety of initiatives which have been incorporated and expanded by private insurance carriers, including health maintenance organizations and other health plans, to extract greater discounts and impose more stringent cost controls upon healthcare provider operations. Examples include, but are not limited to, changes in reimbursement rates and methodologies such as bundled payments, capitation payments, and discounted fee structures. Our tenants and operators may also face significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees. All of these changes could impact our operators’ and tenants’ ability to pay rent or other obligations to us.
Licensure, Certification and Certificate of Need
Our tenants operate hospitals, assisted living facilities, skilled nursing facilities and other healthcare facilities that receive reimbursement for services from third-party payors, including the government sponsored Medicare and Medicaid programs and private insurance carriers. To participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, operators of healthcare facilities must comply with the regulations previously referenced, as well as with licensing, certification and, in 35 states plus the District of Columbia, with certificate of need (“CON”) requirements. Licensing and certification requirements also subject our tenants to compliance surveys and audits which are critical to the ongoing operations of the facilities. 
In granting and renewing these licenses and certifications, the state regulatory agencies consider numerous factors relating to a facility’s operations, including, but not limited to, the plant and physical structure, admission and discharge standards, staffing, training, patient and consumer rights, medication guidelines and other rules. If an operator fails to maintain or renew any required license, certification or other regulatory approval, or to correct serious deficiencies identified in compliance surveys, the operator could be prohibited from continuing operations at a facility. 
A loss of licensure or certification, as well as a change in participation status, could also adversely affect an operator's ability to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which, in turn, could adversely affect the operator's ability to satisfy its contractual obligations, including making rental payments under, and otherwise complying with the terms of, its leases with us. In addition, if we have to replace an operator, we may experience difficulties in finding a replacement because our ability to replace the operator may be affected by federal and state laws governing changes in control and ownership.
Similarly, in order to receive Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, our healthcare facilities must meet the applicable conditions of participation established by HHS relating to the type of facility and its equipment, personnel and standard of medical care, as well as comply with other federal, state and local laws and regulations. Healthcare facilities undergo periodic on-site licensure surveys, which generally are limited if the facility is accredited by The Joint Commission or other recognized accreditation organizations. A loss of licensure or certification could adversely affect a facility's ability to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which, in turn, could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its contractual obligations, including making rental payments under, and otherwise complying with, the terms of the operator's or facility's leases with us.
In most states, skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are subject to various state CON laws requiring governmental approval prior to the development or expansion of healthcare facilities and services. The approval process in these states generally requires a facility to demonstrate the need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. CONs, where applicable, can also be conditions to regulatory approval of changes in ownership or control of licensed facilities, addition of beds, investment in major capital equipment, introduction of new services, termination of services previously approved through the CON process and other control or operational changes.
In CON states, regulators are increasingly concentrating their activities on outpatient facilities and long-term care as those are expanding sectors of the health care industry. CON laws and regulations may restrict an operator's ability to expand properties and grow the operator's business in certain circumstances, which could have an adverse effect on the operator's or tenant's revenues and, in turn, negatively impact their ability to make rental payments under, and otherwise comply with the terms of their leases with us.
11

Fraud and Abuse Enforcement
Various federal and state laws and regulations are aimed at actions that may constitute fraud and abuse by healthcare entities and providers who participate in, submit or cause to be submitted claims for payment to, or make or receive referrals in connection with government-funded healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The federal laws include, for example, the following:

• | The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 USC Section 1320a-7b(b)(b) of the Social Security Act) which prohibits the knowing and willful solicitation, offer, payment or acceptance of any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind in return for: (i) referring an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program; or (ii) purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in party under a federal health care program;


• | The Federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition (42 USC Section 1395nn which is commonly referred as the "Stark Law"), which prohibits referrals by physicians of Medicare patients to providers of a broad range of designated healthcare services in which the physicians (or their immediate family members) have ownership interests or certain other financial arrangements, unless an exception applies, and prohibits the designated health services entity from submitting claims to Medicare for those services resulting from a prohibited referral;


• | The False Claims Act ("FCA") (13 USC Sections 3729-3733) creates liability for any person who submits a false claim to the government or causes another to submit a false claim to the government or knowingly makes a false record or statement to get a false claim paid by the government. In what is known as reverse false claims, the FCA imposes liability where a person acts improperly to avoid having to pay money to the government. The FCA also creates liability for people who conspire to violate the FCA; and 


• | The CMPL (42 USC 1320a-7a for healthcare) authorizes HHS to impose civil penalties administratively for fraudulent acts. The scope of the Office of the Inspector General's authority to enforce the CMPL was increased in 2016.

Courts have interpreted the fraud and abuse laws broadly. Sanctions for violating these federal laws include substantial criminal and civil penalties such as punitive sanctions, damage assessments, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These laws also impose an affirmative duty on operators to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from the Medicare and other government programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to, or more expansive than, the federal fraud and abuse laws. States have also adopted and are enforcing laws that increase the regulatory burden and potential liability of healthcare entities including, but not limited to, patient protections, such as minimum staffing levels, criminal background checks, sanctions for employing excluded providers, restrictions on the use and disclosure of health information, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal penalties.
In the ordinary course of their business, the operators at our properties are regularly subject to inquiries, audits and investigations conducted by federal and state agencies that oversee applicable laws and regulations. Increased funding for investigation and enforcement efforts, accompanied by an increased pressure to eliminate government waste, has led to a significant increase in the number of investigations and enforcement actions over the past several years, a trend which is not anticipated to decrease considerably. Significant enforcement activity has been the result of actions brought by regulators, who file complaints in the name of the United States (and, if applicable, particular states) under the FCA or equivalent state statutes. Also, the qui tam and whistleblower provisions of the FCA allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the government was defrauded. Individuals have tremendous potential financial gain in bringing whistleblower claims as the statute provides that the individual will receive a portion of the money recouped. Additionally, violations of the FCA can result in treble damages. 
Violations of federal or state law or FCA actions against an operator of our properties could have a material adverse effect on the operator's liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Such a negative impact on an operator's financial health could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its contractual obligations, including making rental payments under, and otherwise complying with the terms of, its leases and other agreements with us. Federal and state fraud and abuse laws may also restrict the terms of our rental agreements with our tenants.
Privacy and Security of Health Information
Various federal and state laws protect the privacy and security of health information. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, its implementing regulations and related federal laws and regulations (commonly referred to as "HIPAA") protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information by limiting its use and disclosure. Many states have implemented similar laws to limit the use and disclosure of patient specific health information. The federal government has increased its HIPAA enforcement efforts over the past few years, which has increased the number of audits and enforcement actions, some of which have resulted in significant penalties to healthcare providers. For example, in October 
12

2018, Anthem, Inc. agreed, in addition to implementing various corrective measures, to pay a record $16 million to HHS’s Office for Civil Rights in settlement of HIPAA violations stemming from the largest data breach in United States history. Violations of federal and state privacy and security laws could have a material adverse effect on the operator’s financial condition or operations, which could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its contractual obligations, including making rental payments under, and otherwise complying with the terms of, its leases and other agreements with us. 
Reimbursement
The reimbursement methodologies for healthcare facilities are constantly changing and federal and state authorities may implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact healthcare operations. For example, the ACA enacted certain reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates for various healthcare providers, as well as certain other changes to Medicare payment methodologies.
The ACA has faced ongoing legal challenges, including litigation seeking to invalidate some or all of the law or the manner in which it has been interpreted. The uncertain status of the ACA and of the state Medicaid programs, among other things, affect our ability to plan for the future.
Federal and state budget pressures also continue to escalate and, in an effort to address actual or potential budget shortfalls, Congress and many state legislatures may continue to enact reductions to Medicare and Medicaid expenditures through cuts in rates paid to providers or restrictions in eligibility and benefits. 
The expansion in health insurance coverage under the ACA is likely going to continue to erode in 2019 as cuts in advertising and outreach during the marketplace open-enrollment periods, shorter open enrollment periods, and other changes have left many Americans uncertain about their ability to access and be eligible for coverage. Additionally, the repeal of the individual mandate penalty included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA"), recent actions to increase the availability of insurance policies that do not include ACA minimum benefit standards, and support for Medicaid work requirements will likely impact the market. Accordingly, current and future payments under federal and state healthcare programs may not be sufficient to sustain a facility’s operations, which could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its contractual obligations, including making rental payments under, and otherwise complying with the terms of, the facility’s leases and other agreements with us.
In addition to legislative and executive actions relating to the scope of the ACA, increased enforcement will likely continue to impact the financial framework for healthcare operators and facilities. For example, CMS is focused on reducing what it considers to be payment errors by identifying, reporting, and implementing actions to reduce payment error vulnerabilities. In November 2018, CMS announced its successes in reducing the 2018 Medicare improper payment rate and specifically called out the successes of its actions to address improper payments in home health and skilled nursing facility claims.
In addition, CMS is currently in the midst of transitioning Medicare from a traditional fee for service reimbursement model to a capitated system, which means medical providers are given a set fee per patient regardless of treatment required, and value-based and bundled payment approaches, where the government pays a set amount for each beneficiary for a defined period of time, based on that person’s underlying medical needs, rather than based on the actual services provided. Providers and facilities are increasing responsible to care for and be financially responsible for certain populations of patients under the population health models and this shift in patient management paradigm is creating and will continue to create unprecedented challenges for providers.
Another notable Medicare health care reform initiative, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) established a new payment framework, called the Quality Payment Program, which modified certain Medicare payments to “eligible clinicians,” including physicians, dentists, and other practitioners. MACRA represents a fundamental change in physician reimbursement. The implications of MACRA continue to be uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace. MACRA reporting requirements and quality metrics may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment, leading to further consolidation of the industry. These and other shifts in payment and risk sharing within an outcome-based model are leading to, among other trends, increasing use of management tools to oversee individual providers and coordinate their services. The focus on utilization puts downward pressure on the number and expense of services provided as payors are moving away from a fee for service model. The continued trend toward capitated, value-based, and bundled payment approaches has the potential to diminish the market for certain healthcare providers, particularly specialist physicians and providers of particular diagnostic technologies. This could adversely impact the medical properties that house these physicians and medical technology providers.
Certain of our facilities are also subject to periodic pre- and post-payment reviews and other audits by governmental authorities, which could result in recoupments, denials, or delay of payments. Additionally, the introduction and explosion of new stakeholders competing with traditional providers in the health market, including companies such as Amazon.com Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Apple Inc., CVS Health Corporation, as well as telemedicine, telehealth and mhealth, are disrupting the heath industry and could lead to new trends in payment. All of the factors discussed-recoupment of past payments or denial or delay of future payments-could adversely affect an operator’s ability to satisfy its contractual obligations, including making rental payments under, and otherwise complying with the terms of its leases and other agreements with us.

We regularly assess the financial implications of reimbursement rule changes on our tenants, but we cannot assure you that current rules or future updates will not materially adversely affect our operators and tenants, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on their ability to pay rent and other obligations to us. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Healthcare Industry — Reductions or changes in reimbursement from third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, or delays in receiving these reimbursements could adversely affect the profitability of our tenants and hinder their ability to make rent payments to us” and “— A reduction in Medicare payment rates for skilled nursing facilities may have an adverse effect on the Medicare reimbursements received by certain of our tenants.”
Other Regulations 
Our investments are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments.
Environmental Regulations
As an owner of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental, health and safety matters. These laws and regulations address, among other things, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, fuel, oil management, wastewater discharges, air emissions, radioactive materials, medical wastes, and hazardous wastes, and in certain cases, the costs of complying with these laws and regulations and the penalties for non-compliance can be substantial. Even with respect to properties that we do not operate or manage, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any property from which there is or has been an actual or threatened release of a regulated material and any other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release. Such costs typically are not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property's value. In addition, we may be liable for certain other costs, such as governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources, as a result of any such actual or threatened release.
Under the terms of our lease and management agreements, we generally have a right to indemnification by the tenants, operators and managers of our properties for any contamination caused by them. However, we cannot assure you that our tenants, operators and managers will have the financial capability or willingness to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations to us, and any such inability or unwillingness to do so may require us to satisfy the underlying environmental claims.
We did not make any material capital expenditures in connection with environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances and regulations in 2018 and do not expect that we will be required to make any such material capital expenditures during 2019.
Employees 
We have no employees. Instead, the employees of our Advisor and other affiliates of AR Global perform a full range of services for us, including acquisitions, property management, accounting, legal, asset management and investor relations services. We are dependent on these affiliates for services that are essential to us, including asset acquisition decisions, property management and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that any of these companies were unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to provide such services ourselves by hiring our own workforce or obtaining such services from an unrelated party at potentially higher costs.
