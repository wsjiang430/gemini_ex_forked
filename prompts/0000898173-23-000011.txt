​
OUR BUSINESS
​
Our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy. We remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O’Reilly values, including hard work, superior customer service and expense control. Our mission is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing a higher level of customer service and a better value position than our competitors to both DIY and professional service provider customers.
​
Competitive Advantages
​
We believe our effective dual market strategy, superior customer service, technically proficient store personnel, strategic distribution network and experienced management Team make up our key competitive advantages, which cannot be easily duplicated. 
​

​

Proven Ability to Execute Our Dual Market Strategy:
For more than 40 years, we have established a track record of effectively serving, at a high level, both DIY and professional service provider customers. We believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage. The execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of automotive aftermarket parts consumers, capitalizing on our existing store and distribution infrastructure, operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors and enhancing service levels offered to DIY customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service provider customers.
​
In 2022, we derived approximately 56% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 44% of our sales from our professional service provider customers. Historically, we have increased our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to DIY customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business, which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation. We believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business, due to our systems, knowledge, industry-leading parts availability and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket, augmented by our approximately 725 full-time sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer. We will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on growing our DIY business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy in both existing and new markets.
​
Superior Customer Service:
We seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant in-store experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products. We believe the satisfaction of DIY and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide, in a timely fashion, the correct automotive products needed to complete their repairs. Accordingly, each O’Reilly store carries, or has same or next day availability to, a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications. We continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores and within our network, based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system, market vehicle registration data, failure rates and management’s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace. We have no material backorders for the products we sell.
​
We seek to attract new DIY and professional service provider customers and retain existing customers by offering superior customer service, the key elements of which are identified below:


● | superior in-store service through highly-motivated, technically-proficient store personnel (“Professional Parts People”);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an extensive selection and superior availability of products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | many enhanced service programs, including battery and electrical testing, battery, wiper and bulb replacement and check engine light code extractions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | attractive stores in convenient locations;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | competitive pricing, supported by a good, better, best product assortment designed to meet all of our customers’ quality and value preferences;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a robust point-of-sale system integrated with our proprietary electronic catalog, which contains a wide variety of product images, schematics and technical specifications and equips our Team Members with highly effective tools to source products in our extensive supply network;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | online ordering for our professional customers through our proprietary professional customer platform, www.FirstCallOnline.com, with local delivery available; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | online ordering, featuring “chat with a parts professional,” parts look up assistance for our DIY customers through our retail platform, www.OReillyAuto.com, with convenient store locations for pick up in store orders or home delivery.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Technically Proficient Professional Parts People:
Our highly-motivated, technically-proficient Professional Parts People provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly over less specialized retail operators. We require our Professional Parts People to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard part repairs, in order to better serve the technically-oriented professional service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis. Such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our DIY customers who value the expert assistance provided by our Professional Parts People. See our “Team Members and Human Capital Management” disclosure of the “Business” section of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about our technically proficient professional parts people.

​

Strategic Regional Tiered Distribution Network:
We believe our commitment to a robust, regional, tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hard-to-find parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network. Our strategic, regional, tiered distribution network includes distribution centers (“DCs”) and Hub stores. Our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more DCs, which provides for efficient inventory control and management. We currently operate 28 regional DCs, which provide our stores with same-day or overnight access to an average of 154,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”), many of which are hard-to-find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers. To augment our robust distribution network, we operate a total of 383 Hub stores that also provide delivery service and same-day access to stores within the surrounding areas to an average of 49,000 SKUs, with Hubs in select markets carrying further enhanced inventory levels up to approximately 94,000 SKUs. More than 95% of our stores receive multiple same-day deliveries and deliveries on weekends of hard to find parts from our DCs and Hub stores. We believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business. 
​
Experienced Management Team:
Our Company philosophy is to “promote from within,” and the vast majority of our senior managers, district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the Company. We augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience, technical proficiency or subject matter expertise. We have a strong management Team that has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 30 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in April of 1993. See our “Team Members and Human Capital Management” disclosure of the “Business” section of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about our experienced management Team.
​
Growth Strategy
​
Aggressively Open New Stores:
We intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket. During 2022, we opened 170 net, new domestic stores and 17 new stores in Mexico. In 2023, we plan to open 180 to 190 net, new stores, which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new, contiguous markets. The sites for these new stores have been identified, and to date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to O’Reilly stores. We typically open new stores by


(i) | constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory;
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | acquiring an independently owned auto parts store (“jobber store”), typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets (other than realty) of such store; or
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | purchasing multi-store chains.
------+-------------------------------

​
New store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution. Other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns, demographic lifestyle segmentation, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, vehicles in operation, number and type of existing automotive repair facilities and competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius.
​
We target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network. While we have, and continue to face, aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets, we believe we have competed effectively, and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively, in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets. We also believe that with our dual market strategy, we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas, which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket. Therefore, we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy.
​
Grow Sales in Existing Stores:
Profitable comparable store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy. To achieve improved sales and profitability at existing O’Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers. We believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business, it is customer satisfaction, whether of the DIY consumer or professional service provider, resulting from superior customer service, that generates sustainable increased sales and profitability.
​

​

Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions:
The automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented, and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains, like O’Reilly, to operate more efficiently and effectively than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation. Our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new domestic and international markets.
​
Continually Enhance Store Design and Location:
Our current prototype store design features optimized square footage, high ceilings, convenient interior store layouts, in-store signage, multilingual signage, bright lighting, convenient ingress and egress, ample parking and dedicated counters to serve professional service provider customers, each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies to enhance overall customer service. We continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance. During 2022, while experiencing macroeconomic constraints to construction timing and the supply of material and equipment, we relocated 11 stores and performed minor to major updates or renovations to approximately 1,300 additional stores. We believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in comparable store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network, which is strategically located to best attract and serve our customers. 
​
Omnichannel Growth Strategy:
Our Omnichannel growth strategies reflect the continued evolution of customer preferences in researching and completing purchases. More than ever before, our customers’ purchase decisions are informed by a range of interactions, whether in-person, over the phone, or through a variety of digital channels, as they seek to find the professional parts knowledge and the product availability they need to meet their automotive repair and maintenance needs. Our Omnichannel growth strategies are focused on offering our customers an enhanced and seamless research and buying experience through any of these channels. We have long been known for excellent customer service and continue to grow the functionality and user-friendliness of our digital platforms, including www.OReillyAuto.com and www.FirstCallOnline.com, to enhance our customers’ shopping experience. Many of our customers interact over multiple channels to research and complete a purchase, and the functionality and features of our digital sites complement the outstanding customer service provided in our brick and mortar locations.
​
Team Members and Human Capital Management
​
Our tradition for 66 years has been to treat all of our Team Members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our “Live Green” culture, which emphasizes the importance of each Team Member’s contribution to the success of O’Reilly. This focus on professionalism and respect has created an industry-leading Team, and we consider our relations with our Team Members to be excellent. 
​
We are committed to providing a work environment that allows Team Members to feel highly valued and to be productive and effective in their jobs by maintaining an inclusive environment and healthy work/life balance, which we believe increases employee engagement. Our ongoing emphasis on diversity and inclusion, including our policies, recruitment and selection procedures, onboarding processes and training efforts, positively builds upon our successful “promote from within” philosophy and growth strategies. 
​
Talent Acquisition, Retention and Training:
Our Company knows the value of a tenured Team, which is why our philosophy is to “promote from within” first. As management opportunities arise, we look first within the Company and promote those who have performed well, have the right expertise and have shown leadership potential before looking outside the Company; however, we augment this philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience, customer service excellence, subject matter expertise, and strong culture fit. This comprehensive approach increases Team Member commitment and has resulted in a very experienced leadership Team. As of December 31, 2022, our strong management Team was comprised of 226 senior managers who average 20 years of service, 293 corporate managers who average 16 years of service and 591 district managers who average 14 years of service.
​
Each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers, in addition to parts specialists, retail and/or installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store. Each of our 591 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 10 stores, which provides our stores with strong operational support.
​
We offer a variety of specific training programs that address a broad spectrum of topics from store and distribution center operations to customer service. We believe our highly trained Team of Professional Parts People is essential in providing superior customer service to both DIY and professional service provider customers. A significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers; therefore, our Professional Parts People are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products. In addition, we have found that the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance from Professional Parts People, particularly when purchasing hard 

8



​

parts. The ability of our Professional Parts People to provide such assistance to the DIY customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat DIY business.
​
We screen prospective Team Members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts and repairs or automotive aptitude. New store Team Members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our Company, as well as the requirements for their specific position. Additionally, during their first year of employment, our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide high levels of service to our customers. Once all of the required training has been satisfied, our parts specialists become eligible to take the O’Reilly Certified Parts Professional test. Passing the O’Reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (“ASE”).
​
All of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers. For this reason, select Team Members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager. These Team Members then spend at least one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers. Each Team Member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development.
​
Additionally, store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service, leadership, inventory management and store profitability, as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model. Store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position, including attending a week-long manager development program at the corporate headquarters in Springfield, Missouri. Store and district managers also receive continuous training through online training programs, field workshops, regional meetings and our annual leadership conference.
​
Diversity and Inclusion:
At O’Reilly, valuing diversity and inclusion is about creating an environment in which our Team Members feel included, respected and have opportunities to do their best work and achieve their greatest potential. We believe diversity within the workplace is crucial in running our business and building the best Team of Professional Parts People to serve our customers. We are committed to recruiting and building a diverse team through inclusive talent acquisition, ongoing leadership development and actively identifying emerging talent. We have worked to expand opportunities for all of our Team Members through programs designed to prepare them to take on more responsibilities at every level of the organization. We firmly believe that promoting from within is a differentiator in maximizing our diversity across the entire company. In order to ensure our diversity and inclusion efforts are successful, we survey our Team Members, provide enhanced, collaborative learning through diversity and inclusion training and resources, and build network groups, action plans and programs aimed at improving our work environments for our Team Members and customers.
​
Compensation, Benefits and Recognition:
Our compensation philosophy has always been to incentivize Team Members to “run it like you own it,” and we continually evaluate and benchmark our comprehensive compensation programs to ensure they remain competitive, providing an important tool to attract and retain the best and most qualified Team Members in every market. We provide financial incentives to all store Team Members through various incentive compensation programs. Store team members have the opportunity to earn incentive pay that increases their base hourly wage consistent with their individual performance or the performance of their store. Store managers, district managers, region directors and division vice presidents have the ability to earn additional compensation above their salary or base hourly wage based upon the performance of their stores. In addition, beginning with the district manager level, we augment our competitive programs with share-based compensation. We believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our Team Members.
​
Just as pay, benefits, and growth opportunities are critically important to our Team Members’ success, we believe it is equally important to recognize Team Members for a job well done. We regularly present many awards that range from recognizing individual service longevity to performance, allowing peer-to-peer recognition or management nomination of an individual’s excellent performance. 
​
Team Composition:
We recognize that each and every one of our Team Members plays a very important role in our ability to provide outstanding customer service and achieve consistent, successful performance. As of January 31, 2023, we employed 87,745 Team Members (71,612 full-time Team Members and 16,133 part-time Team Members), of whom 71,582 were employed at our stores, 11,789 were employed at our DCs and 4,374 were employed at our corporate and regional offices. Ours is an increasingly technical business creating the need for knowledgeable Professional Parts People, and our ongoing focus on developing a technically proficient Team has resulted in the growth of the mix of our full-time work force, increasing from 65% at January 31, 2020 to 82% at January 31, 2023. While full-time Professional Parts People play a vital role in our ongoing success, the flexibility of incorporating part-time employment into our work force is also 

9



​

an important component of providing excellent customer service. Many of our part-time Team Members choose to work at O’Reilly while attending school, or during other transitional periods in their lives, or simply because of their passion for cars and knowledge of auto parts. Part-time Team Members have the opportunity to become career Professional Parts People because of our promote from within philosophy, and many of our leaders today began their careers as part-time Team Members in our stores or distribution centers. 
​
A union represents 435 Team Members in 47 stores in the Greater Bay Area in California and has for many years. There are 52 Team Members that drive over-the-road trucks in two of our domestic DCs that are also represented by a labor union. Additionally, two unions represent approximately 1,076 Team Members in Mexico. We consider our current relationship with these unions and union Team Members to be excellent. With the exception of the previously described Team Members, our Team Members are not represented by labor unions. 
​
Additional information about our Team Member population and human capital management practices can be found in our most recent Sustainability, Social, and Governance report, which is available on our website at www.OReillyAuto.com. Our Sustainability, Social, and Governance report is not, and will not be deemed to be, a part of this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
​
Store Network
​
New Store Site Selection:
In selecting sites for new stores, we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution. Other key factors we consider in the site selection process are


● | population density;
--+--------------------


● | demographics, including age, life style and per capita income;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | market economic strength, retail draw and growth patterns;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | number, age and percent of makes and models of registered vehicles;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the number, type and sales potential of existing automotive repair facilities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the number of auto parts stores and other competitors within a predetermined radius;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | physical location, traffic count, size, economics and presentation of the site;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | financial review of adjacent existing locations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | the type and size of store that should be developed.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

​
When entering new, more densely populated markets, we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale. After opening this initial cluster of new stores, we begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas. As these store clusters mature, we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas. This strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market.
​
Store Locations and Size:
As a result of our dual market strategy, we are able to profitably operate in both large, densely populated markets and small, less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket. Our U.S. stores, on average, carry approximately 22,000 SKUs and average approximately 7,500 total square feet in size. At December 31, 2022, we had a total of approximately 45 million square feet in our 5,929 domestic stores. Our domestic stores are served primarily by the nearest DC, which averages 154,000 SKUs, but also have same-day access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 383 Hub stores that average 12,700 square feet in size and carry an average of 49,000 SKUs, with Hubs in select markets carrying further enhanced inventory levels up to an approximately 94,000 SKUs.
​
We believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity. Consequently, most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking, easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers.

Distribution Systems
​
We believe that our tiered distribution model provides industry-leading parts availability and store in-stock positions, while optimizing our inventory investment by controlling the depth of our store stocked inventory. Our distribution expansion strategy, supported by our ongoing, significant capital investments, complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores, and additional penetration into existing markets, in the regions surrounding each DC. As of December 31, 2022, we had a total growth capacity of 150 to 300 U.S. stores in our distribution network. Further enhancing our distribution capabilities in 2023, we plan to open our first DC in Puerto Rico and a large DC in Guadalajara, Mexico.
​
Distribution Centers:
As of December 31, 2022, we operated 28 domestic DCs comprised of approximately 12.1 million operating square feet (see the “Properties” table in Item 2 of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about DC operating square footages). Our DCs stock an average of 154,000 SKUs and most DCs are linked to and have access to multiple other regional DCs’ inventory. Our DCs provide five-night-a-week delivery, primarily via a Company-owned fleet, to substantially all of our stores in the continental United States. In addition, stores within an individual DC’s metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the DC’s “city counter,” many of which receive this service seven days per week. Our DCs provide service to not only the stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic Hub locations, which redistribute products to surrounding stores. Our national Hub store network provides additional service throughout the week, and on weekends, to surrounding stores.
​
As part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2023, we plan to


● | continue to enhance our distribution network through the engineering, design, expansion or relocation of new or current DCs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | continue to utilize routing software to enhance logistics efficiencies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | continue to implement labor management software to improve DC productivity and overall operating efficiency;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | continue to define and implement best practices in all DCs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | make proven, return-on-investment based capital enhancements to material handling equipment in DCs, including conveyor systems, picking modules, lift equipment and computer hardware; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | continue to augment our robust distribution network, when and where appropriate, through the use of strategically located Hubs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Hub Stores:
We currently operate a total of 383 strategically located Hub stores. In addition to serving DIY and professional service provider customers in their markets, Hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area and access to an expanded selection of SKUs on a same-day basis. Our Hub store network consists of 383 Hubs that average approximately 12,700 square feet and carry an average of 49,000 SKUs, with Hubs in select markets carrying further enhanced inventory levels up to approximately 94,000 SKUs.
​
Products and Purchasing
​
Our stores offer DIY and professional service provider customers a wide selection of products for domestic and imported automobiles, vans and trucks. Our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized, well-advertised, premium name brand products, such as AC Delco, Armor All, Bosch, Castrol, Dorman, Fel-Pro, Gates Rubber, Lucas Oil, Mobil1, Monroe, Moog, Pennzoil, Prestone, Standard, STP, Turtle Wax, Valvoline, Wagner, and Wix, and a wide selection of quality proprietary private label products, which span the entire good, better and best value spectrum, under our BesTest®, BrakeBest®, Cartek®, Import Direct®, MasterPro®, MicroGard®, Murray®, Omnispark®, O’Reilly Auto Parts®, Precision®, Power Torque®, Super Start®, Syntec®, and Ultima® brands. Our proprietary private label products are produced by respected automotive manufacturers, meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and consist of house brands and nationally recognized proprietary bands, which we have acquired or developed over time. Our “good” proprietary brands provide a great combination of quality and value, a characteristic important to our DIY customers, while our “better” and “best” proprietary brands offer options for our more heavy-duty DIY customers, as well as our professional service provider customers, who often prefer higher quality products that can be relied upon to support and grow their businesses.
​
We have no long-term contracts with material purchase commitments with any of our suppliers, nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts. We believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell. It is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers. We have entered into various programs 

12



​

and arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases. As a whole, we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good.
​
We purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 815 suppliers, the five largest of which accounted for approximately 24% of our total purchases in 2022. Our largest supplier in 2022 accounted for approximately 7% of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3% to 6% of our total purchases.
​
Marketing
​
Retail and Online Marketing:
Our integrated marketing strategy and Omnichannel efforts include national media channels, in-store, digital and social media activation, as well as marketing the O’Reilly brand through automotive event sponsorships and on-site appearances throughout the country. Our O’Rewards loyalty program encourages repeat customers, as they accumulate points from their O’Reilly purchases that are redeemable for rewards at various purchase levels. Our marketing efforts also target the Spanish-speaking market through broadcast media, print and sports marketing, as well as sponsorships of local and regional events.
​
Professional Marketing:
To develop our continued relationships with professional service providers and installers, we employ Territory Sales Managers in nearly every market to ensure complete sales territory coverage and personalized service for professional customers. Flyers, quick reference guides and catalogs are distributed on a regular basis to all professional service providers, including paint and body shops and fleet maintenance customers to encourage brand and program awareness. In addition, our professional customer program, First Call, also offers a proprietary ordering and other services platform called www.FirstCallOnline.com, dedicated Professional Service Specialists in stores, multiple daily deliveries and access to training opportunities, shop management, maintenance supplies and the Certified Auto Repair program, which offers professional service providers with the business tools they need to profitably grow and market their business. 
​
INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT
​
The automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavy-duty vehicles after the original sale. The total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately $357 billion, according to the Auto Care Association. This market is made up of four segments: labor share of professional service provider sales, auto parts share of professional service provider sales, DIY sales and tire sales. We estimate that O’Reilly’s addressable market within this industry is approximately $130 billion to $140 billion, which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales at wholesale and DIY sales at retail. We do not sell tires or perform for-fee automotive repairs or installations. 
​
Competition
​
The sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas, including customer service, product availability, store location, brand recognition and price. We compete in both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market. We compete primarily with


● | national retail and wholesale automotive parts chains (such as AutoZone, Inc., Advance Auto Parts, CARQUEST and NAPA);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regional retail and wholesale automotive parts chains;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | wholesalers or jobber stores (some of which are associated with national automotive parts distributors or associations such as NAPA, CARQUEST, Bumper to Bumper and Auto Value);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | automobile dealers; and
--+------------------------


● | mass merchandisers and online retailers that carry automotive replacement parts, maintenance items and accessories (such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc.).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We compete on the basis of customer service, which includes merchandise selection and availability, technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel, price, store layout, the Omnichannel experience and convenient and accessible store locations. Our dual market strategy requires significant capital, including the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket.
​

​

Inflation and Seasonality
​
We have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition costs increased due to price increases industry wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.
​
To some extent our business is seasonal, primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales, profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.
​
Regulations
​
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business, as well as the health and safety of our Team Members and customers, including, but not limited to, those related to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, the recycling of batteries and used lubricants and the ownership and operation of real property.
​
As part of our operations, we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with, for example, our used oil, oil filter and battery recycling programs. We currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third-party suppliers. The batteries and used lubricants are collected by our Team Members, deposited into supplier-provided containers and pallets and then recycled by the third-party suppliers. In general, our agreements with such suppliers contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination, which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off-site properties (including as a result of waste disposal) and to our properties, when caused by the supplier.
​
Compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date. However, we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations.
