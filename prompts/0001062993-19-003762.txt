 Corporate Overview
The Company has identified the global tourism market as its first investment target. As it currently exists, the tourism industry is fragmented into various geographic regions. We believe that approaching this industry from a global perspective is an emerging market with tremendous growth potential. We plan to set up and/or acquire offices in various regions of the world and through them, develop the local tourism industry and expand our local tourism market. Ultimately, we plan to unify and manage our regional offices and to market our global services through the internet. 
 We have set up three subsidiaries, Airchn Travel Global, Inc. in Seattle, Washington ("ATGI") and Airchn Travel (Canada) Inc. in Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada ("ATCI") and Airchn Travel (Beijing) Inc. in Beijing, China ("ATBI"). We plan to set up additional subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Japan and Korea in the near future. Our Beijing office has been closed as of June 30, 2019 due to lack of business and to reduce operating costs. 
 We are engaged in services such as airline and cruise ticketing, customized and packaged tours, travel blogs, travel magazines, sales of travel related merchandise, group hotel reservations, business travel arrangements, conference travel arrangements, car rental and admission ticket sale for local tourist attractions.
