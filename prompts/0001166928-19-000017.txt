ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General Development of Business
West Bancorporation, Inc. (the Company or West Bancorporation) is an Iowa corporation and a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHCA).  The Company was formed in 1984 to own West Bank, an Iowa-chartered bank headquartered in West Des Moines, Iowa.  West Bank is a business-focused community bank that was organized in 1893. The Company’s primary activity during 2018 was the ownership of West Bank. The Company’s and West Bank’s only business is banking, and therefore, no segment information is presented in this report.
As a financial holding company, the Company has additional flexibility to engage in a broader range of financial activities through affiliates than are permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. While the Company does not currently have a plan to engage in any new activities, as a financial holding company, it has the ability to respond more quickly to market developments and opportunities. 
The Company operates in three markets: central Iowa, which is generally the greater Des Moines metropolitan area; eastern Iowa, which is the area including and surrounding Iowa City and Coralville, Iowa; and the Rochester, Minnesota, area.
The Company’s financial performance goal is to be in the top quartile of our benchmarking peer group, which at the end of 2018 consisted of 15 Midwestern, publicly traded financial institutions. The Company and West Bank achieved strong results in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as measured by the following four key metrics: 

l | Return on average assets: | 1.31 | %
l | Return on average equity: | 15.68 | %
l | Efficiency ratio (1): | 48.92 | %
l | Texas ratio: | 0.93 | %

 (1) As presented, this is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Part II, Item 7 - "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for additional details.

Based on peer group analysis using data from the nine months ended September 30, 2018, which is the latest available data, the Company’s results and ratios for the fiscal year 2018 were better than those of each member of our defined peer group for each of the measures shown above, except for five peers that had a higher return on average assets. We currently believe our fiscal year 2018 results will similarly compare with the results of our peer group once comparable peer results are available for the fiscal year 2018.
2018 was a year of milestones for the Company. West Bancorporation reported record net income and total assets in 2018 and paid its highest level of dividends in the Company’s history. West Bank celebrated 125 years of building strong relationships with individuals, families and businesses who value our dedication to community banking. West Bank also celebrated five years of serving the Rochester, Minnesota market. 
During 2018, the Company received a number of financial performance recognitions, including the following:

• | West Bancorporation received national recognition from investment bank and research firm Raymond James in the annual Raymond James Community Bankers Cup, which identifies America’s top performing publicly traded community banks with assets between $500 million and $10 billion. The Raymond James Community Bankers Cup recognizes the top 10% of exchange-traded community banks based on various profitability, operational efficiency, and balance sheet metrics. Raymond James ranked West Bancorporation number seven in the nation for 2017. This is the fifth consecutive year we have made this list. 


• | West Bancorporation was ranked number 12 among the publicly traded banks with assets between $1 billion and $5 billion in Bank Director Magazine’s 2017 Bank Performance Scorecard. In addition to this ranking, West Bancorporation was ranked number 21 in the nation across banks of all sizes in the same Bank Performance Scorecard. The rankings were based on five measures related to profitability, capitalization and asset quality. This is the sixth consecutive year we have made this list. 

The Company continued to grow in 2018, as loans outstanding at the end of 2018 totaled $1.72 billion compared to $1.51 billion at the end of 2017, an increase of 14.0 percent. Total deposits grew 4.6 percent at December 31, 2018 from the balances as of December 31, 2017. We believe the pipeline for new business is good, as we continue to focus efforts on sales through strengthening existing relationships and developing new relationships. We are confident in our ability to cultivate quality relationships and deliver excellent service.
To meet the changing needs of customers and improve the efficiency of resources, the Company consolidated the Iowa City and Coralville branches in the fourth quarter of 2018. Accordingly, the Company recognized a write-down of premises of $333 thousand related to the Iowa City branch facility. Eastern Iowa customers will continue to be served by our team at the Coralville branch and through our online and mobile banking platforms. 
One of the keys to our 2018 operating success was an improvement in net interest income as a result of an increase in the average volume of interest-earning assets. Also contributing to our higher 2018 earnings was the continued low level of nonperforming assets. As of December 31, 2018, total nonperforming assets were $1.9 million, or 0.08 percent of total assets, compared to $0.6 million, or 0.03 percent of total assets, as of December 31, 2017. The Company also benefited in 2018 from the lower federal income tax rate.
The Company declared and paid cash dividends on common stock totaling $0.78 per share in 2018 and declared a $0.20 quarterly dividend on January 23, 2019, payable on February 20, 2019 to stockholders of record on February 6, 2019. The Company expects to continue paying regular quarterly dividends in the future. In the opinion of management, the capital position of the Company was strong at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, the Company’s tangible common equity ratio at was 8.32 percent. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no intangible assets or preferred stock.
Description of the Company’s Business
West Bank provides full-service community banking and trust services to customers located primarily in the Des Moines, Coralville and Iowa City, Iowa, and Rochester, Minnesota, metropolitan areas. West Bank has eight offices in the Des Moines area, one office in Coralville and one office in Rochester. West Bank offers many types of credit to its customers, including commercial, real estate and consumer loans.  West Bank offers trust services, including the administration of estates, conservatorships, personal trusts and agency accounts.

West Bank offers a full range of deposit services, including checking, savings and money market accounts and time certificates of deposit. West Bank also offers internet, mobile banking and treasury management services, which help to meet the banking needs of its customers. Treasury management services offered to business customers include cash management, client-generated automated clearing house transactions, remote deposit and fraud protection services. Also offered are merchant credit card processing and corporate credit cards. 
West Bank’s business strategy emphasizes strong business and personal relationships between West Bank and its customers and the delivery of products and services that meet the individualized needs of those customers.  West Bank also emphasizes strong cost controls, while striving to achieve an above average return on equity and return on assets.  To accomplish these goals, West Bank focuses on small- to medium-sized businesses in its local markets that traditionally wish to develop an exclusive relationship with a single bank.  West Bank has the size to provide the personal attention required by local business owners and the financial expertise and entrepreneurial attitude to help businesses meet their financial service needs. 
The economies in our market areas are fairly diversified. The Des Moines, Iowa, metropolitan area has a population of approximately 635,000 and an unemployment rate of 2.3 percent. The major sources of employment in this area include financial services companies, healthcare providers and agribusiness industries along with local school districts and federal, state and local governments. Major employers include Wells Fargo & Co., Mercy Medical Center, UnityPoint Health, Hy-Vee Inc., Principal Financial Group and federal, state and local governments. The Iowa City, Iowa, metropolitan area has a population of approximately 97,000 and an unemployment rate of 2.1 percent. The major sources of employment in this area include educational institutions, healthcare providers, and local schools and governments. Major employers include the University of Iowa and University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. The Rochester, Minnesota, metropolitan area has a population of approximately 116,000 and an unemployment rate of 2.3 percent. The major sources of employment in this area include healthcare providers, technology and agribusiness industries, and local schools and government. Major employers include Mayo Clinic and IBM, and local schools and governments. 
The market areas served by West Bank are highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits.  West Bank competes with other commercial banks, many of which are subsidiaries of other bank holding companies, credit unions, mortgage companies and other financial service providers. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) Summary of Deposits, as of June 30, 2018, there were 36 banks operating within Polk County, Iowa, where seven of West Bank’s offices are located.  As of the same date, West Bank ranked fourth based on total deposits of all banking offices in Polk County.  As of June 30, 2018, there were 16 banks within Johnson County, Iowa, which includes the Coralville office. As of the same date, West Bank ranked fourth based on total deposits of all banking offices in Johnson County.  West Bank also has one office located in Dallas County, Iowa, and as of June 30, 2018, had 2.1 percent of the deposits in Dallas County, Iowa.  For the entire state of Iowa, West Bank ranked seventh in terms of deposit size as of June 30, 2018. As previously mentioned, West Bank also has one office located in Rochester, Minnesota, and as of June 30, 2018, had 1.1 percent of the deposits in Olmsted County, Minnesota. 
Some of West Bank’s competitors are locally controlled, while others are regional, national or international companies. The larger national or regional banks have certain competitive advantages due to their ability to undertake substantial advertising campaigns and allocate their investment assets to out-of-market geographic regions with potentially higher returns.  Such banks also offer certain services, such as international and conduit financing transactions, which are not offered directly by West Bank.  These larger banking organizations also have much higher legal lending limits than West Bank, and therefore, may be better able to service large regional, national and global commercial customers.
In order to compete to the fullest extent possible with the other financial institutions in its primary market areas, West Bank uses the flexibility and knowledge of its local management, Board of Directors and community advisors.  West Bank has a group of community advisors in each of its markets who provide insight to management on current business activity levels and trends. West Bank seeks to capitalize on customers who desire to do business with a local institution. This includes emphasizing specialized services, local promotional activities, and personal contacts by West Bank’s officers, directors and employees.  In particular, West Bank competes for loans primarily by offering competitive interest rates, experienced lending personnel with local decision-making authority, flexible loan arrangements, quality products and services, and proactive relationship management. West Bank competes for deposits principally by offering depositors a variety of straight-forward deposit products and convenient office locations and hours, along with electronic access and other personalized services.  
West Bank also competes with the general financial markets for funds.  Yields on corporate and government debt securities and commercial paper affect West Bank’s ability to attract and hold deposits.  West Bank also competes for funds with money market accounts and similar investment vehicles offered by brokerage firms, mutual fund companies, internet banks and others. The competition for these funds is based almost exclusively on yields to customers.
The Company and West Bank had approximately 163 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2018.

Supervision and Regulation
General 
FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, our growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the Iowa Division of Banking, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Furthermore, taxation laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), securities laws administered by the SEC and state securities authorities, and anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) have an impact on our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and accounting rules are significant to our operations and results.
Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than stockholders. These federal and state laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of our business; the kinds and amounts of investments we may make; reserve requirements; required capital levels relative to our assets; the nature and amount of collateral for loans; the establishment of branches; our ability to merge, consolidate and acquire; dealings with our insiders and affiliates; and our payment of dividends. In reaction to the global financial crisis and particularly following the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), we experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny. Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence filtered down in varying degrees to community banks over time and caused our compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase. After the 2016 federal elections, momentum to decrease the regulatory burden on community banks gathered strength. In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (Regulatory Relief Act) was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations. While the Regulatory Relief Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion, like us, and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these changes are intended to result in meaningful regulatory relief for community banks and their holding companies, including new rules that may make our capital requirements less complex. For a discussion of capital requirements, see “The Role of Capital.” It also eliminated questions about the applicability of certain Dodd-Frank Act reforms to community bank systems, including relieving us of any requirement to engage in mandatory stress tests, maintain a risk committee or comply with the Volker Rule’s complicated prohibitions on proprietary trading and ownership of private funds. We believe these reforms are favorable to our operations, but the true impact remains difficult to predict until rulemaking is complete and the reforms are fully implemented. 
The supervisory framework for U.S. banking organizations subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that are not publicly available and that can impact the conduct and growth of their business. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations. 
The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to the Company and West Bank, beginning with a discussion of the continuing regulatory emphasis on our capital levels. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision.

The Role of Capital
Regulatory capital represents the net assets of a banking organization available to absorb losses. Because of the risks attendant to their business, FDIC-insured institutions are generally required to hold more capital than other businesses, which directly affects their earnings capabilities. While capital has historically been one of the key measures of the financial health of both bank holding companies and banks, its role became fundamentally more important in the wake of the global financial crisis, as the banking regulators recognized that the amount and quality of capital held by banks prior to the crisis was insufficient to absorb losses during periods of severe stress. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, discussed below, establish strengthened capital standards for banks and bank holding companies, require more capital to be held in the form of common stock, and disallow certain funds from being included in capital determinations.  These standards represent regulatory capital requirements that are meaningfully more stringent than those in place previously.
Minimum Required Capital Levels. Banks have been required to hold minimum levels of capital based on guidelines established by the bank regulatory agencies since 1983. The minimums have been expressed in terms of ratios of “capital” divided by “total assets”. As discussed below, bank capital measures have become more sophisticated over the years and have focused more on the quality of capital and the risk of assets. Bank holding companies have historically had to comply with less stringent capital standards than their bank subsidiaries and have been able to raise capital with hybrid instruments such as trust preferred securities. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated the Federal Reserve to establish minimum capital levels for holding companies on a consolidated basis as stringent as those required for FDIC-insured institutions. A result of this change is that the proceeds of hybrid instruments, such as trust preferred securities, which holding companies could issue as capital, were excluded from capital over a phase-out period. However, if such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank holding companies with less than $15 billion of assets, they may be retained, subject to certain restrictions. Because we have assets of less than $15 billion, we are able to maintain our trust preferred proceeds as capital but we will not be able to raise capital in the future through the issuance of trust preferred securities.
The Basel International Capital Accords. The risk-based capital guidelines for U.S. banks since 1989 were based upon the 1988 capital accord known as “Basel I” adopted by the international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central banks and bank supervisors that acts as the primary global standard-setter for prudential regulation, as implemented by the U.S. bank regulatory agencies on an interagency basis. The accord recognized that bank assets for the purpose of the capital ratio calculations needed to be assigned risk weights (the theory being that riskier assets should require more capital) and that off-balance sheet exposures needed to be factored in the calculations. Basel I had a very simple formula for assigning risk weights to bank assets from 0 percent to 100 percent based on four categories. In 2008, the banking agencies collaboratively began to phase-in capital standards based on a second capital accord, referred to as “Basel II,” for large or “core” international banks (generally defined for U.S. purposes as having total assets of $250 billion or more, or consolidated foreign exposures of $10 billion or more) known as “advanced approaches” banks. The primary focus of Basel II was on the calculation of risk weights based on complex models developed by each advanced approaches bank. As most banks were not subject to Basel II, the U.S. bank regulators worked to improve the risk sensitivity of Basel I standards without imposing the complexities of Basel II. This “standardized approach” increased the number of risk-weight categories and recognized risks well above the original 100 percent risk weight. It is institutionalized by the Dodd-Frank Act for all banking organizations as a floor.
On September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement on a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations around the world, known as “Basel III”, to address deficiencies recognized in connection with the global financial crisis.
The Basel III Rule. In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in pertinent part, and, at the same time, promulgated rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (Basel III Rule). In contrast to capital requirements historically, which were in the form of guidelines, Basel III was released in the form of regulations by each of the regulatory agencies. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all banking organizations that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and state banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies, other than “small bank holding companies” who are relieved from compliance with the Basel III Rule. While holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $3 billion, like the Company, are considered small bank holding companies for this purpose, we have securities registered with the SEC and that disqualifies us from taking advantage of the relief. Banking organizations became subject to the Basel IIII Rule on January 1, 2015 and its requirements were fully phased-in as of January 1, 2019.
The Basel III Rule impacts both the definitions of the various forms of capital used to calculate the ratios and how assets will be weighted for the purpose of calculating such ratios. It increased the required quantity and quality of capital and required more detailed categories of risk weights of riskier, more opaque assets. For nearly every class of assets, the Basel III Rule requires a more complex, detailed and calibrated assessment of risk in the calculation of risk-weight amounts.

Not only did the Basel III Rule increase most of the required minimum capital ratios in effect prior to January 1, 2015, but it introduced the concept of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, which consists primarily of common stock, related surplus (net of Treasury stock), retained earnings, and Common Equity Tier 1 minority interests subject to certain regulatory adjustments. The Basel III Rule also changed the definition of capital by establishing more stringent criteria that instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (primarily noncumulative perpetual preferred stock that meets certain requirements) and Tier 2 Capital (primarily other types of preferred stock, subordinated debt and the allowance for loan losses, subject to limitations). A number of instruments that qualified as Tier 1 Capital under Basel I do not qualify, or their qualifications changed. For example, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, which qualified as simple Tier 1 Capital under Basel I, does not qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but qualifies as Additional Tier 1 Capital. The Basel III Rule also constrained the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets in capital and requires deductions from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital in the event that such assets exceed a certain percentage of a banking institution’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.
The Basel III Rule required minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015, as follows:

• | A ratio of minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital equal to 4.5 percent of total risk-weighted assets;


• | An increase in the minimum required amount of Tier 1 Capital from 4 percent to 6 percent of total risk-weighted assets;


• | A continuation of the minimum required amount of Total Capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) at 8 percent of total risk-weighted assets; and


• | A minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total quarterly average assets equal to 4 percent in all circumstances.

In addition, institutions that seek the freedom to make capital distributions (including for dividends and repurchases of stock) and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction must also maintain 2.5 percent in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to a capital conservation buffer (fully phased in as of January 1, 2019). The purpose of the conservation buffer is to ensure that banking institutions maintain a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses during periods of financial and economic stress. Factoring in the conservation buffer increases the minimum ratios depicted above to 7 percent for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 8.5 percent for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5 percent for Total Capital.
Well-Capitalized Requirements. The ratios described above are minimum standards in order for banking organizations to be considered “adequately capitalized.” Bank regulatory agencies uniformly encourage banks to hold more capital and be “well-capitalized” and, to that end, federal law and regulations provide various incentives for banking organizations to maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. For example, a banking organization that is well-capitalized may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications; and (iii) accept, roll-over or renew brokered deposits. Higher capital levels could also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. For example, the Federal Reserve’s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. Further, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions (i.e., Tier 1 Capital less all intangible assets), well above the minimum levels.
Under the capital regulations of the FDIC and Federal Reserve, in order to be well-capitalized, a banking organization must maintain:

• | A Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio to total risk-weighted assets of 6.5 percent or more;


• | A ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8 percent or more (6 percent under Basel I);


• | A ratio of Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 10 percent or more (the same as Basel I); and


• | A leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total adjusted average quarterly assets of 5 percent or greater.

It is possible under the Basel III Rule to be well-capitalized while remaining out of compliance with the capital conservation buffer discussed above.
As of December 31, 2018: (i) West Bank was not subject to a directive from the FDIC to increase its capital; and (ii) West Bank was well-capitalized, as defined by FDIC regulations. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had regulatory capital in excess of the Federal Reserve’s requirements and met the fully phased-in Basel III Rule requirements.

Prompt Corrective Action. The concept of being “well-capitalized” is part of a regulatory regime that provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take “prompt corrective action” to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions based on the capital level of each particular institution. The extent of the regulators’ powers depends on whether the institution in question is “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized,” in each case as defined by regulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators’ corrective powers include: (i) requiring the institution to submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) limiting the institution’s asset growth and restricting its activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to sell itself; (iv) restricting transactions between the institution and its affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rates that the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution. 
The Potential for Community Bank Capital Simplification. Community banks have long raised concerns with bank regulators about the regulatory burden, complexity, and costs associated with certain provisions of the Basel III Rule. In response, Congress provided a potential Basel III “off-ramp” for institutions, like us, with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. Section 201 of the Regulatory Relief Act instructed the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (CBLR) of between 8 and 10 percent. On November 21, 2018, the agencies proposed setting the CBLR at 9 percent of tangible equity to total assets for a qualifying bank to be well-capitalized. Under the proposal, a community banking organization would be eligible to elect the new framework if it has: less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of certain assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a CBLR greater than 9 percent. The electing institution would not be required to calculate the existing risk-based and leverage capital requirements of the Basel III Rule and would not need to risk weight its assets for purposes of capital calculations.
We are in the process of considering the CBLR proposal and will await the final regulation to determine whether we will elect the framework.
Regulation and Supervision of the Company
General. The Company, as the sole stockholder of West Bank, is a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status. As a bank holding company, we are registered with, and subject to regulation by, the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHCA). We are legally obligated to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to West Bank and to commit resources to support West Bank in circumstances where we might not otherwise do so. Under the BHCA, we are subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve and are required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports of our operations and such additional information regarding our operations as the Federal Reserve may require. 
Acquisitions and Activities/Financial Holding Company Election. The primary purpose of a bank holding company is to control and manage banks. The BHCA generally requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for any merger involving a bank holding company or any acquisition by a bank holding company of another bank or bank holding company. Subject to certain conditions (including deposit concentration limits established by the BHCA), the Federal Reserve may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States. In approving interstate acquisitions, the Federal Reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its FDIC-insured institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state institutions or their holding companies) and state laws that require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company. Furthermore, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to effect interstate mergers or acquisitions. For a discussion of the capital requirements, see “The Role of Capital” above.
The BHCA generally prohibits the Company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries. This general prohibition is subject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in, and to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve prior to November 11, 1999 to be “so closely related to banking ... as to be a proper incident thereto.” This authority would permit us to engage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including the ownership and operation of any entity engaged in consumer finance, equipment leasing, the operation of a computer service bureau (including software development), mortgage banking and brokerage services. The BHCA does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies.
11

Additionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the BHCA and elect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities, including securities and insurance underwriting and sales, merchant banking and any other activity that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines by regulation or order is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the Federal Reserve determines by order to be complementary to any such financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of FDIC-insured institutions or the financial system generally. In the third quarter of 2016, we elected to operate as a financial holding company. In order to maintain our status as a financial holding company, both the Company and West Bank must be well-capitalized, well-managed, and have at least a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating. If the Federal Reserve determines that we are not well-capitalized or well-managed, we will have a period of time in which to achieve compliance, but during the period of noncompliance, the Federal Reserve may place any limitations on us it believes to be appropriate. Furthermore, if the Federal Reserve determines that West Bank has not received a satisfactory CRA rating, we will not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities. As of December 31, 2018, we retained our election as a financial holding company, but we have not engaged in any activity and did not own any assets for which a financial holding company designation was required. The election affords the ability to respond more quickly to market developments and opportunities.
Change in Control. Federal law also prohibits any person or company from acquiring “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator. Control is conclusively presumed to exist upon the acquisition of 25 percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, but may arise under certain circumstances between 10 percent and 24.99 percent ownership. 
Capital Requirements. We have been subject to the complex consolidated capital requirements of the Basel III Rule since the U.S. federal banking agencies approved its implementation effective January 1, 2015. Only qualifying small bank holding companies were excluded from compliance with the Basel III Rule by virtue of the Federal Reserve’s “Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement”. Prior to 2018, our assets were in excess of the maximum permitted in the definition of a small bank holding company for this purpose; however, the Regulatory Relief Act expanded the category of holding companies that may rely on the policy statement by raising the maximum amount of assets they may hold to $3 billion, and the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule, effective August 30, 2018, to bring the policy statement in line with the law. As a result, qualifying holding companies with assets of less than $3 billion are not subject to the capital requirements of the Basel III Rule and are deemed to be “well-capitalized”. However, one of the qualifications for this treatment is that the holding company not have securities registered with the SEC. We are a public reporting company and have shares registered with the SEC. As such, we do not meet the qualifications of the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement. For a discussion of capital requirements, see “The Role of Capital” above.
Dividend Payments. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be affected by both general corporate law considerations and policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies. As an Iowa corporation, we are subject to the limitations of Iowa law, which allows us to pay dividends unless, after such dividend, (i) we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or (ii) our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amount that would be needed if we were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend payment, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders whose rights are superior to the rights of the stockholders receiving the distribution. 
As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends to stockholders if: (i) the company’s net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. The Federal Reserve also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends will have to maintain 2.5 percent in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer. See “The Role of Capital” above.

Monetary Policy.  The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has a significant effect on the operating results of financial or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the tools available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market transactions in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.
Federal Securities Regulation. Our common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Consequently, we are subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act.
Corporate Governance.  The Dodd-Frank Act addressed many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments, and authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate and solicit voters for their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of bank holding companies, regardless of whether such companies are publicly traded.
Regulation and Supervision of West Bank
General. West Bank is an Iowa-chartered bank. The deposit accounts of West Bank are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) to the maximum extent provided under federal law and FDIC regulations, currently $250,000 per insured depositor category. As an Iowa-chartered FDIC-insured bank, West Bank is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the Iowa Division of Banking, the chartering authority for Iowa banks, and the FDIC, designated by federal law as the primary federal regulator of insured state banks that, like West Bank, are not members of the Federal Reserve System (nonmember banks).
Deposit Insurance.  As an FDIC-insured institution, West Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC.  The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification. For institutions, like West Bank, that are not considered large and highly complex banking organizations, assessments are now based on examination ratings and financial ratios. The total base assessment rates currently range from 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points. At least semi-annually, the FDIC updates its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increases or decreases the assessment rates, following notice and comment on proposed rulemaking. The assessment base against which an FDIC-insured institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the DIF have been calculated since effectiveness of the Dodd-Frank Act is based on its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. This method shifted the burden of deposit insurance premiums toward those large depository institutions that rely on funding sources other than U.S. deposits.
The reserve ratio is the FDIC insurance fund balance divided by estimated insured deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act altered the minimum reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to FDIC-insured institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.  The reserve ratio reached 1.36 percent as of September 30, 2018 (most recent available), exceeding the statutory required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35 percent. The FDIC will provide assessment credits to insured depository institutions, like West Bank, with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion for the portion of their regular assessments that contribute to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15 percent and 1.35 percent. The FDIC will apply the credits each quarter that the reserve ratio is at least 1.38 percent to offset the regular deposit insurance assessments of institutions with credits.
FICO Assessments.   In addition to paying basic deposit insurance assessments, FDIC-insured institutions must pay Financing Corporation (FICO) assessments. FICO is a mixed-ownership governmental corporation chartered by the former Federal Home Loan Bank Board pursuant to the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 to function as a financing vehicle for the recapitalization of the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. FICO issued 30-year noncallable bonds of approximately $8.1 billion that mature in 2017 through 2019. FICO’s authority to issue bonds ended on December 12, 1991. Since 1996, federal legislation has required that all FDIC-insured institutions pay assessments to cover interest payments on FICO’s outstanding obligations. The FICO assessment rate is adjusted quarterly. 
Supervisory Assessments.  All Iowa banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the Iowa Division of Banking to fund the operations of that agency. The amount of the assessment is calculated on the basis of West Bank’s total assets. 
Capital Requirements.  Banks are generally required to maintain capital levels in excess of other businesses. For a discussion of capital requirements, see “The Role of Capital” above.
13

Liquidity Requirements. Liquidity is a measure of the ability and ease with which bank assets may be converted to cash. Liquid assets are those that can be converted to cash quickly if needed to meet financial obligations. To remain viable, FDIC-insured institutions must have enough liquid assets to meet their near-term obligations, such as withdrawals by depositors. In addition to liquidity guidelines already in place, the U.S. bank regulatory agencies implemented the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCR) in September 2014, which require large financial firms to hold levels of liquid assets sufficient to protect against constraints on their funding during times of financial turmoil. While the LCR only applies to the largest banking organizations in the country, we continue to review our liquidity risk management policies in light of these developments.
Dividend Payments. The primary source of funds for the Company is dividends from West Bank. Under the Iowa Banking Act, Iowa-chartered banks generally may pay dividends only out of undivided profits. The Iowa Division of Banking may restrict the declaration or payment of a dividend by an Iowa-chartered bank, such as West Bank. The payment of dividends by any FDIC-insured institution is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and an FDIC-insured institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be undercapitalized. As described above, West Bank exceeded its capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of December 31, 2018. Notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends, however, the FDIC and the Iowa Division of Banking may prohibit the payment of dividends by West Bank if either or both determine such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends will have to maintain 2.5 percent in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer. See “The Role of Capital” above.
State Bank Investments and Activities. West Bank is permitted to make investments and engage in activities directly or through subsidiaries as authorized by Iowa law. However, under federal law and FDIC regulations, FDIC-insured state banks are prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from making or retaining equity investments of a type, or in an amount, that are not permissible for a national bank. Federal law and FDIC regulations also prohibit FDIC-insured state banks and their subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, from engaging as principal in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank unless West Bank meets, and continues to meet, its minimum regulatory capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity would not pose a significant risk to the DIF. These restrictions have not had, and are not currently expected to have, a material impact on the operations of West Bank.
Insider Transactions. West Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on “covered transactions” between West Bank and its “affiliates.” The Company is an affiliate of West Bank for purposes of these restrictions, and covered transactions subject to the restrictions include extensions of credit to the Company, investments in the stock or other securities of the Company, and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of the Company as collateral for loans made by West Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.
Certain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by West Bank to its directors and officers, to directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, to principal stockholders of the Company and to “related interests” of such directors, officers and principal stockholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person who is a director or officer of the Company or West Bank, or a principal stockholder of the Company, may obtain credit from banks with which West Bank maintains a correspondent relationship. 
Safety and Soundness Standards/Risk Management. FDIC-insured institutions are expected to operate in a safe and sound manner. The federal banking agencies have adopted operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of such institutions that address internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings.
In general, the safety and soundness standards prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals. If an institution fails to operate in a safe and sound manner, the FDIC-insured institution’s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance. If an FDIC-insured institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal regulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency. Until the deficiency cited in the regulator’s order is cured, the regulator may restrict the FDIC-insured institution’s rate of growth, require the FDIC-insured institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances. Operating in an unsafe or unsound manner will also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal bank regulatory agencies, including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments.

During the past decade, the bank regulatory agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of sound risk management processes and strong internal controls when evaluating the activities of the FDIC-insured institutions they supervise. Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of financial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets. The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal and reputational risk. In particular, recent regulatory pronouncements have focused on operational risk, which arises from the potential that inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses. New products and services, third-party risk and cybersecurity are critical sources of operational risk that FDIC-insured institutions must address in the current environment. West Bank is expected to have active board and senior management oversight; adequate policies, procedures and limits; adequate risk measurement, monitoring and management information systems; and comprehensive internal controls.
Branching Authority.  Iowa banks, such as West Bank, have the authority under Iowa law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Iowa, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. The Dodd-Frank Act permits well-capitalized and well-managed banks to establish new interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) without impediments. Federal law permits state and national banks to merge with banks in other states subject to: (i) regulatory approval; (ii) federal and state deposit concentration limits; and (iii) state law limitations requiring the merging bank to have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) prior to the merger. 
Transaction Account Reserves. Federal Reserve regulations require FDIC-insured institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). For 2019, the first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempt from reserves and have a zero percent reserve requirement; for transaction accounts aggregating between $16.3 million to $124.2 million, the reserve requirement is 3 percent of those transaction account balances; and for net transaction accounts in excess of $124.2 million, the reserve requirement is 10 percent of the aggregate amount of total transaction account balances in excess of $124.2 million. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve.
Community Reinvestment Act Requirements. CRA requires West Bank to have a continuing and affirmative obligation in a safe and sound manner to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Federal regulators regularly assess West Bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its communities. Applications for additional acquisitions would be affected by the evaluation of West Bank’s effectiveness in meeting its CRA requirements.
Anti-Money Laundering.  The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act) is designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the U.S. financial system and has significant implications for FDIC-insured institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The USA PATRIOT Act mandates financial services companies to have policies and procedures with respect to measures designed to address any or all of the following matters: (i) customer identification programs; (ii) money laundering; (iii) terrorist financing; (iv) identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions; (v) currency crimes; and (vi) cooperation between FDIC-insured institutions and law enforcement authorities.
Privacy and Cybersecurity.  West Bank is subject to many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and procedures to protect non-public confidential information of their customers. These laws require West Bank to periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and permit consumers to opt out of their ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. They also impact West Bank’s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. In addition, West Bank is required to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. These security and privacy policies and procedures, for the protection of personal and confidential information, are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations.

Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate.  Concentration risk exists when FDIC-insured institutions deploy too many assets to any one industry or segment. A concentration in commercial real estate is one example of regulatory concern. The interagency Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices guidance (CRE Guidance) provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) commercial real estate loans exceeding 300 percent of capital and increasing 50 percent or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100 percent of capital. The CRE Guidance does not limit banks’ levels of commercial real estate lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies issued a statement to reinforce prudent risk-management practices related to CRE lending, having observed substantial growth in many markets, increased competitive pressures, rising CRE concentrations in banks, and an easing of CRE underwriting standards. The federal bank agencies reminded FDIC-insured institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise prudent risk-management practices to identify, measure, monitor and manage the risks arising from CRE lending. In addition, FDIC-insured institutions must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentration risk.
West Bank has historically exceeded, and continues to exceed, the 300 percent guideline for commercial real estate loans. Additional monitoring processes have been implemented to manage this increased risk. 
Consumer Financial Services. The historical structure of federal consumer protection regulations applicable to all providers of consumer financial products and services changed significantly on July 21, 2011, when the CFPB commenced operations to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all providers of consumer products and services, including West Bank, as well as the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over providers with more than $10 billion in assets. FDIC-insured institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, like West Bank, continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators. 
Because abuses in connection with residential mortgages were a significant factor contributing to the financial crisis, many new rules issued by the CFPB and required by the Dodd-Frank Act addressed mortgage and mortgage-related products, their underwriting, origination, servicing and sales. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded underwriting requirements applicable to loans secured by 1-4 family residential real property and augmented federal law combating predatory lending practices. In addition to numerous disclosure requirements, the Dodd Frank Act imposed new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders in an effort to strongly encourage lenders to verify a borrower’s ability to repay, while also establishing a presumption of compliance for certain “qualified mortgages”. The Regulatory Relief Act provided relief in connection with mortgages for banks with assets of less than $10 billion, and, as a result, mortgages West Bank makes are now considered to be qualified mortgages if they are held in portfolio for the life of the loan.
We do not currently expect the CFPB’s rules to have a significant impact on our operations, except for higher compliance costs.
