Corporate History and Background
We are a clinical stage biotechnology company committed to discovering and developing drug candidates to selectively modulate the Wnt pathway, a critical mediator of tissue repair, in a broad range of organs and tissues. We are located in South San Francisco, California.
On August 11, 2021, Consonance consummated a business combination, or the Business Combination, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, entered into on April 15, 2021 among Consonance, Merger Sub, and Legacy Surrozen. Legacy Surrozen is a Delaware company incorporated on August 12, 2015. Upon closing of the Business Combination, Consonance became a Delaware corporation and was renamed to "Surrozen, Inc.," Legacy Surrozen was renamed to "Surrozen Operating, Inc.," and Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy Surrozen, with Legacy Surrozen as the surviving company and, after giving effect to such merger, continuing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Surrozen.
Overview
Our mission is to transform the treatment of serious disease by fully exploiting the Wnt pathway. We are discovering and developing biologic drug candidates to selectively modulate the Wnt pathway, a critical mediator of tissue repair, in a broad range of organs and tissues, for human diseases. Building upon the seminal work of our founders and scientific advisors who discovered the Wnt gene and key regulators of the Wnt pathway, we have made breakthrough discoveries that we believe will overcome previous limitations in harnessing the potential of Wnt biology. These breakthroughs enable us to rapidly and flexibly design tissue-targeted therapeutics that modulate Wnt signaling. As a result of our discoveries, we are pioneering the selective activation of Wnt signaling, designing and engineering Wnt pathway mimetics, and advancing tissue-selective Wnt candidates.
Our lead product candidates are multi-specific, antibody-based therapeutics that mimic the roles of naturally occurring Wnt or R-spondin proteins, which are involved in activation and enhancement of the Wnt pathway, respectively. Given Wnt signaling is essential in tissue maintenance and regeneration throughout the body, we have the potential to target a wide variety of severe diseases, including certain diseases that afflict the intestine, liver, retina, cornea, lung, kidney, cochlea, skin, pancreas and central nervous system. In each of these areas, we believe our approach has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for the disease and substantially impact patient outcomes.
Our strategy is to exploit the full potential of Wnt signaling by identifying disease states responsive to Wnt modulation, design tissue-selective therapeutics, and advance candidates into clinical development in targeted indications with high unmet need. Our unique approach and platform technologies have led to the discovery and advancement of two lead product candidates.
We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in the second quarter of 2022 for SZN-1326, our candidate in development for moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, with ulcerative colitis, or UC, as our first proposed indication. SZN-1326, a Fzd5 targeted bi-specific antibody, is our first development candidate designed using Surrozen’s SWAP technology and targets the Wnt-signaling pathway in the intestinal epithelium. In preclinical animal models of acute and chronic colitis, SZN-1326 has been shown to transiently activate Wnt signaling in the diseased intestine, stimulate intestinal epithelial regeneration, reduce inflammation and reduce disease activity. In November 2022, we announced that we voluntarily paused enrollment in the single ascending dose, or SAD, portion of our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating SZN-1326 in healthy volunteers. Following the evaluation of the clinical data and further preclinical work, we will be re-initiating the Phase 1a clinical trial in healthy volunteers by mid-2023 based on the minimum anticipated biologically effective level (MABEL) and anticipate safety data by the end of 2023. We anticipate initiating a Phase 1b clinical trial in ulcerative colitis patients in 2024 and expect proof of concept data to be potentially available in the second half of 2024.
 We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in the second quarter of 2022 for SZN-043, our candidate in development for severe alcoholic hepatitis, or AH. SZN-043, a hepatocyte-specific R-spondin mimetic bispecific fusion protein targeting ASGR1, is the first development candidate using Surrozen’s SWEETS technology which is designed to mimic the regenerative properties of the protein R-Spondin by enhancing Wnt signaling in a cell-targeted manner. In multiple preclinical animal models of liver injury and fibrosis, SZN-043 has been shown to selectively activate Wnt signaling in the liver, stimulate transient hepatocyte proliferation, improve liver function and reduce fibrosis. We completed enrollment in the second cohort of the SZN-043 Phase 1a single ascending dose clinical trial in 2022 in healthy volunteers. We opened enrollment for the Phase 1a clinical trial in chronic liver disease, enrolled the first patient in the first quarter of 2023 and expect data to be available in the second half of 2023. We anticipate initiating a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis in 2024 and expect proof of concept data to be potentially available in the second half of 2024.
 

In the first quarter of 2022, we nominated SZN-413, a Fzd4 targeted bi-specific antibody, as a development candidate for the treatment of retinal vascular associated diseases. Fzd4 mediated Wnt signaling is known to play a critical role in retinal vascular integrity and function. Data generated in preclinical models of retinopathy demonstrated SZN-413 stimulated Wnt signaling and was able to induce normal retinal vessel regrowth while suppressing pathological vessel growth. In October 2022, we executed a Collaboration and Licensing Agreement, or CLA, with Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, or BI, to research, develop and commercialize Fzd4 bi-specific antibodies designed using our SWAP technology, including SZN-413. We anticipate the potential to identify the lead Fzd-4-targeted Wnt agonist product candidate by the end of 2023, which would trigger a $10.0 million milestone payment to us.
 Fundamental Importance of the Wnt Pathway and Our Founders’ Roles in Its Discovery
The Wnt pathway holds significant therapeutic promise in view of its ability to regulate stem cell renewal, proliferation and differentiation, and its central role in tissue regeneration. Over the past 30 years our founders and advisors have helped establish the fundamental importance of the Wnt pathway in tissue regeneration. Each has been on the forefront of the Wnt signaling pathway research, and their discoveries are the foundation of our approach to therapeutic development.
 Wnt proteins exert a wide variety of effects on target cells during development. Fundamentally, Wnts are growth stimulatory factors that promote cell proliferation. Compared to other growth factors, two distinctive aspects of Wnt proteins are their lack of specificity and their ability to give shape to growing tissues while inducing cells to proliferate, acting in the process as directional growth factors. Wnt signals can instruct new cells in such a way that organized body plans are generated. Moreover, Wnt proteins employ a number of receptor isoforms and sub-families, generating an array of combinatorial Wnt signaling critical for correctly shaping tissues during development, maintaining tissue architecture in adult life and repairing tissue injury.
 Dr. Roel Nusse and Dr. Harold Varmus discovered the first Wnt gene in 1982. Wnt signaling has now been shown to be critical to many essential normal functions. Dr. Nusse is a founder of our company and a member of our Scientific Advisory Board.
 Past Limitations in Targeting the Wnt Pathway for Drug Discovery
 Although modulation of Wnt signaling has held significant promise for decades, a number of characteristics of Wnt signaling have created obstacles to conventional protein therapeutic approaches. The key obstacles to drug development targeting the Wnt signaling pathway are described below:
 Potent Pathway Activation: While the activity of naturally occurring Wnt pathway agonists is well established, previous attempts to engineer synthetic Wnt and R-spondin ligands have not resulted in selective, potent activation of Wnt signaling.
 Selectivity: Naturally occurring Wnt ligands are not selective in their interactions. The same lack of selectivity is observed with naturally occurring R-spondin ligands and their interactions with the cell surface receptors. Moreover, components of the Wnt signaling pathway, which can be targeted with small molecules, are widely expressed and therefore cannot be selectively targeted.
 Manufacturing: Wnt ligands are highly hydrophobic, making them difficult to express, solubilize and purify and therefore difficult to manufacture.
 Our Wnt Therapeutics Platform
 Our Scientific Capabilities
 We believe that our breakthrough discoveries and technologies will enable us to overcome the challenges facing drug developers targeting the Wnt pathway. We believe we are potentially the first developer to manufacture synthetic, soluble Wnt mimetics. To date, we have developed potent, selective and manufacturable Wnt and R-spondin mimetics that are designed to replicate the role of naturally occurring Wnt and R-spondin proteins. In pursuit of our goal to develop a portfolio of Wnt product candidates that can repair tissue damage and regenerate functional tissues for patients, we are continuing to expand our platform through the development of novel technologies and capabilities required to research, develop, manufacture and ultimately commercialize therapeutic products that address unmet medical needs. Our core capabilities are described below:
 Wnt Biology Expertise: We have established a deep understanding of the Wnt pathway and its role in disease biology and have invested significantly in our people and technologies that enable us to selectively modulate Wnt signaling. Our research and development organization is led by world-class scientists. We have partnered with key thought leaders in the field, including those on our Scientific Advisory Board, and have developed significant expertise in various areas of biology relevant to the Wnt signaling pathway.
 Proprietary Antibody Discovery and Research Technologies: We have developed proprietary antibody discovery capabilities that have led to the discovery of two initial antibody technologies that enable us to potently and selectively modulate the Wnt pathway. Our SWAP (Surrozen Wnt signal Activating Protein) technology enables the design and development of Wnt-mimetics, and our SWEETS (Surrozen Wnt signal Enhancers Engineered for Tissue Specificity) technology enables the design and

development of R-spondin mimetics. Importantly, our approach provides a flexible and robust platform that has generated multiple antibodies that possess either tissue or cell selectivity based on preclinical studies.
 Additional Novel Wnt Modulating Technologies: We have developed and filed patent applications for additional Wnt modulating antibody technologies, and are committed to continuously integrating new insights, tools, technologies and capabilities to apply to additional diseases and areas.
 Genetic Mapping of Wnt Signaling: The role of Wnt signaling in disease and the differential expression of genes involved in Wnt signaling have not been well characterized across many disease states. We isolate RNA for gene expression to identify potential deficiencies in Wnt signaling in specific diseases. Through our genetic mapping, we have increased our understanding of Wnt biology in numerous diseases and Wnts’ involvement in diseases that had previously not been well-characterized.
 Protein Science Capabilities: We have invested in building capabilities in key areas of antibody discovery which include: in vitro and in vivo binder discovery, antibody optimization including humanization, structural biology, cell line construction, upstream and downstream process development and purification, bioanalytical characterization, developability assessments including stability and formulatability. These capabilities enable discovery of novel structures and sequences and optimization for pharmacokinetics, potency, selectivity, manufacturability and other drug-like properties.
 Our Scientific Approach
 By combining our Wnt biology expertise with our proprietary technologies and capabilities, we have been able to establish a broad array of therapeutic opportunities. Our approach includes:
 Identifying and characterizing areas where Wnt biology is critical to tissue structure and function. To date, we have investigated the importance of Wnt signaling in over 20 different tissue types and have prioritized multiple tissue types for further exploration, with a plan to continue to expand our efforts.
 Prioritizing disease opportunities where there is significant evidence based on our proprietary model systems and tool compounds that Wnt activation could play a role in tissue repair in severe disease.
 Focusing efforts and investments in diseases where the strength of our capabilities can potentially address key limitations of existing therapeutic approaches.
 Seeking to limit or eliminate the potential oncogenic risk from Wnt pathway activation through our selective activation in the target disease tissue, we focus on severe disease and limited treatment exposure, and mimicking a physiologic repair process that is self-limiting. In preclinical studies, we have observed that the predominant response to Wnt signaling is in diseased tissue.
 Our Technologies
 Our two initial proprietary technologies, SWAP and SWEETS, enable us to potently and selectively modulate Wnt signaling through the generation of Wnt and R-spondin mimetics. Using these technologies, we design and develop antibodies that modulate Wnt signaling. Product candidates generated by these technologies have demonstrated the ability to repair tissue damage in multiple preclinical models including colitis and liver injury. We have developed specific candidate molecules for each disease area based on the associated tissue biology, the role of Wnt signaling in disease versus normal tissue, and a functional assessment of our candidate molecules.
 Our SWAP and SWEETS technologies focus on key regulators of Wnt signaling, Wnt proteins and R-spondins.
 Wnt Activation: SWAP (Surrozen Wnt signal Activating Protein)
 Our SWAP molecules are designed to mimic the activity of naturally occurring Wnt proteins. They are bispecific full-length human (IgG) antibodies that, like Wnt proteins, directly activate the Wnt-signaling pathway in target tissue by binding to two of its natural co-receptors, Fzd and Lrp. With our SWAP technology, we combine Fzd and Lrp antibody-binding domains into bispecific antibodies to selectively activate Wnt signaling. We have generated and validated a broad library of SWAPs that have successfully activated Wnt-signaling. Our product candidates, SZN-1326 and SZN-413, utilize our SWAP technology and are designed to activate the Wnt pathway in injured tissue where certain Fzd receptors are expressed and the natural Wnt ligand is disturbed.
 Key characteristics of our SWAP technology include:
 Potency: Our Wnt mimetics are multivalent, designed to bind one or more Fzd receptors and one or more Lrp receptors. We demonstrated that the ability to bind to one or more receptors leads to highly potent Wnt signal activation as compared to a protein that can only bind to one Lrp receptor and one Fzd receptor.
 Selectivity: Our antibody-based proteins are capable of selective binding to individual Fzd and Lrp receptor isoforms and selective isoform binding has the potential to confer tissue selectivity.


Manufacturability: Our antibody platform is designed to produce molecules with properties suitable for manufacturing and to overcome the challenges of Wnt protein derivates. Unlike our antibodies, Wnt proteins are highly hydrophobic, making them difficult to express, solubilize and purify.
 Dr. Christopher Garcia, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and one of our founders, enabled our SWAP approach through the discovery of surrogate Wnt agonists. His surrogate ligands were water soluble, consisted of two domains and provided the building blocks for our SWAP technology.
 Subsequent discoveries made at Surrozen improved the potency and selectivity of the surrogate ligands discovered by Dr. Garcia. Our technology allows for targeting of Fzd and Lrp receptors, and we believe we can identify an optimized ratio of Fzds and Lrps required to activate Wnt signaling. We have also discovered that binding two different Fzds together with Lrp leads to efficient Wnt signal activation. Figure 1 below compares natural Wnt signaling to how our SWAP product candidates engage receptors on the cell surface to trigger Wnt signal activation.
 
Figure 1. Like endogenous Wnt (left side), our SWAP technology activates Wnt signaling by binding specific Fzd and Lrp receptors (right side)
 Wnt Amplification: SWEETS (Surrozen Wnt signal Enhancer Engineered for Tissue Specificity)
 Our SWEETS molecules are designed to amplify the body’s response to naturally occurring Wnt proteins. They are antibody-based molecules that, like R-spondin, enhance Wnt signaling by stabilizing Fzd receptors. Our SWEETS molecules are designed to modify the specificity of R-spondin activity such that it can be directed to a cell surface antigen of our choosing. Our SWEETS molecules consist of a full-length antibody fusion protein in which an antibody-binding domain of one of these antigens is combined with an R-spondin derivative. SZN-043 is our initial product candidate to utilize our SWEETS technology and is designed to selectively amplify the Wnt pathway in hepatocytes, the most abundant type of liver cell.
 R-spondin may be beneficial in adult tissue repair, particularly in situations where naturally occurring Wnt ligands are present but signaling is insufficient to repair tissue damage. One major challenge facing drug developers targeting the Wnt pathway in harnessing R-spondin-based Wnt amplification has been limiting R-spondin’s effects to a specific tissue of interest, which we believe we have overcome through:
 Reducing non-specific binding. Naturally occurring R-spondins are dependent on E3 ligases and leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptors, or LGRs, for activity. LGRs are widely expressed and result in R-spondins enhancing Wnt signaling in a broad variety of tissues. Based on preclinical studies, we have been able to eliminate the requirement for LGR binding through substitution of binding to different cell surface receptors; and


Targeting specific cell types. We have designed multiple antibodies targeted to several cell surface receptors. Based on preclinical studies, these antibodies have demonstrated specificity to multiple tissues and cell lineages. The engineered antibodies specifically upregulated Wnt-signaling with greater tissue specificity than non-targeted controls and stimulated proliferation
 Figure 2 below illustrates the effect of Fzd (and Lrp) stabilization on promoting Wnt signaling. On the left side of the image, unbound E3 ligases induce internalization and ubiquitination of Fzd receptors, leading to disruption of Wnt signaling. With our SWEETS technology, we have demonstrated tissue-targeted binding and sequestration of E3 ligases leading to the stabilization of Fzd and Lrp and promotion of Wnt signaling. With our SWEETS technology, we have been able to affect tissue-targeted binding and inhibition of E3 ligase promoted degradation of Fzd, leading to the promotion of Wnt signaling.
 
Figure 2. Our SWEETS technology leads to amplification of the Wnt signaling pathway by inhibition of Fzd degradation by the E3 ligase/proteasome pathway. Specificity of SWEETS binding is driven by an antigen-binding domain that can be targeted to specific cell surface protein
 Our Product Candidates and Research Programs
 We believe that both our SWAP and SWEETS technologies have the potential to generate a portfolio of product candidates that can harness the tissue repair activity of the Wnt pathway for a broad spectrum of severe diseases.
 The chart below represents a summary of our wholly owned product candidates:
 
Figure 3. Lead programs
 Our first product candidate, SZN-1326, is being developed as a novel treatment for moderate to severe IBD, with UC as our first proposed indication, and utilizes our proprietary SWAP technology to activate Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling plays a critical role in intestinal epithelial turnover and normal function. Abnormal signaling has been observed in patients with IBD and restoration of normal signaling is believed to play a role in the repair of damaged intestinal epithelial cells in IBD. SZN-1326 targets Fzd 5, Fzd 8 and Lrp 6 to activate Wnt signaling. We have observed that Fzd 5, Fzd 8 and Lrp 6 are expressed in the large bowel epithelium of UC tissue samples and that Fzd 5 is the most abundant, representing an attractive target for our therapeutic approach. IBD affects an estimated two million patients in the United States and is caused by damage to the intestinal barrier and an enhanced inflammatory response, which further exacerbates tissue damage. SZN-1326 is designed to activate Wnt-pathway signaling in intestinal epithelial cells. In multiple mouse models of IBD, SZN-1326 stimulated intestinal epithelial regeneration, characterized by restoration of the intestinal barrier and reduced histology severity score, lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and reduced disease activity. We will be re-initiating the Phase 1a clinical trial by mid-2023 based on the minimum anticipated biologically effective level (MABEL) and anticipate safety data by the

end of 2023. We anticipate initiating a Phase 1b clinical trial in ulcerative colitis patients in 2024 and expect proof of concept data to be potentially available in the second half of 2024.
 Our second product candidate, SZN-043, is being developed as a novel treatment for severe liver diseases, including severe AH, and utilizes our proprietary SWEETS technology. Severe AH is a disease with a 90-day mortality rate of 30% and has an estimated incidence of approximately 130,000 patients in the United States annually. In severe AH, damage to hepatocytes due to excessive alcohol use leads to jaundice, inflammation, impaired blood coagulation and increased risk of infections that may impact other organs such as the kidneys, brain and gastrointestinal system. We have designed SZN-043 to modulate naturally occurring Wnt signaling that is specifically targeted to hepatocytes. We have shown in preclinical models of liver injury that SZN-043 selectively and transiently stimulates hepatocyte proliferation, and restores liver function as measured by plasma ammonia. The selectivity of SZN-043 is achieved through the inclusion of an antibody binding domain selective for ASGR1 that is solely expressed on hepatocytes. We completed enrollment in the second cohort of the SZN-043 Phase 1a single ascending dose clinical trial in healthy volunteers in 2022. We opened enrollment for the Phase 1a clinical trial in chronic liver disease, enrolled the first patient in the first quarter of 2023 and expect data to be available in the second half of 2023. We anticipate initiating a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis in 2024 and expect proof of concept data to be potentially available in the second half of 2024.
 Our third product candidate, SZN-413, a Fzd4 targeted bi-specific antibody, is being developed as a novel treatment for retinal vascular-associated diseases and utilizes our proprietary SWAP technology to activate Wnt signaling. Fzd4-mediated Wnt signaling is known to play a critical role in retinal vascular integrity and function, and data with Fzd4-specific Surrozen Wnt modulating tool molecules have shown that selectively activating Wnt signaling can rescue a disease phenotype in a norrin knockout model. Data evaluating SZN-413 in preclinical models of retinopathy demonstrated that activation of Wnt signaling increased tight unction protein expression in retinal vascular endothelial cells and significantly reduced avascular area and pathological neovascular tuft formation in an oxygen-induced retinopathy mouse model. In October 2022, we executed a CLA with BI to research, develop and commercialize Fzd4 bi-specific antibodies designed using our SWAP technology, including SZN-413. We anticipate the potential to identify the lead Fzd-4-targeted Wnt agonist product candidate by the end of 2023.
 Our Research Programs
 We believe that both our SWAP and SWEETS technologies have the potential to generate a portfolio of product candidates that can harness the tissue regenerative activity of the Wnt pathway and potentially bring therapeutic benefit to patients suffering from a broad spectrum of diseases. Our goal in each of these programs is to activate the natural ability of tissues in the body to heal themselves by increasing the Wnt signaling pathway in a localized, transient, and, we believe, safe manner.
 By leveraging our scientific capabilities and approach, we have identified multiple potential tissue types to explore. We are currently focused on developing potential therapeutics for ocular diseases such as dry eye and fuch’s endothelial dystrophy.
 One of our more advanced preclinical programs targets the lacrimal gland. Tear-producing lacrimal glands rely on Wnt signaling for maintenance of function. Restoration of lacrimal gland function through activation of Wnt signaling is a potential therapeutic approach to treat dry eye, including dry eye associated with Sjogren’s Disease. Preclinical data demonstrated that our Wnt-modulating molecules activated Wnt signaling in the lacrimal gland and increased tear production in a mouse IL-1a lacrimal gland injury model. The chart below represents a summary of our research programs:

 Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to develop a portfolio of product candidates that can repair tissue damage and regenerate functional tissues for a variety of diseases. Consistent throughout our strategy is our goal to activate Wnt signaling only within targeted diseased tissue, focusing on severe diseases, and mimicking the self-limiting physiologic repair process. We plan to achieve this goal by:
 •Continuing to build on our pioneering research, insights and intellectual property in Wnt pathway modulation. Our scientific capabilities and approaches are built upon the groundbreaking work of our academic co-founders and have been developed further by our experienced team. We consider ourselves to be pioneers in the selective modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and intend to utilize our proprietary insights into Wnt biology and our proprietary technologies to further advance our research and exploration of its therapeutic potential.
 •Developing SZN-1326 for the treatment of moderate to severe IBD. We have shown that SZN-1326 leads to rapid repair of tissue damage and functional improvements in mouse models of IBD. We intend to initially develop SZN-1326 in patients with moderate to severe UC and then expand into the treatment of other intestinal diseases including CD. We will be re-initiating the Phase 1a clinical trial in healthy volunteers by mid-2023. We anticipate initiating a Phase 1b clinical trial in ulcerative colitis patients in 2024.
 •Developing SZN-043 for the treatment of liver disease.

We anticipate initiating a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis in 2024.
 •Developing novel product candidates and expanding our platform technologies to further our leading position in developing the Wnt signaling pathway modulators. Wnt signaling is critical in tissue regeneration throughout the body, including in intestine, liver, lung, retina, kidney, cochlea, cornea, skin, pancreas and central nervous system. Our research suggests that SWAP and SWEETS will provide us with the opportunity to generate specific modulators of Wnt signaling. We have generated libraries of Wnt and R-spondin receptor binders that have helped us create a broad portfolio of product candidates. We have developed and filed patent applications for additional Wnt modulating antibody technologies and are committed to continuously applying new insights, tools, technologies and capabilities to additional diseases and areas and adding to our platform technologies and pipeline.
 •Pursuing strategic alliances to maximize the full potential of our pipeline. The importance of the Wnt signaling pathway and the potential therapeutic applications of Wnt pathway mimetics are expected to provide us with an abundance of product 


candidates. We believe this generates an exciting opportunity to enter into strategic alliances to accelerate product development and maximize commercial potential.
 Wnt Signaling Pathway—A Central Regulator of Tissue Regeneration
 As gatekeepers for the maintenance of stem cells and functions, prior attempts at modulating Wnt signaling were hampered by an absence of drug-like properties. Through our technologies, we can modulate Wnt signaling with antibodies, which could open the door for the development of a new classes of drugs with the ability to repair and regenerate damaged tissues.
 Signaling through the Wnt pathway can stimulate cell proliferation as well as control cell differentiation and movement. Cell-to-cell communication is needed during embryonic development, and Wnt signaling is essential for development to proceed properly. In both embryonic stem cells and pluripotent stem cells, the Wnt pathway has a dual role in both promoting stem cell renewal and differentiation of certain cell types. In adults, Wnt has a critical role in promoting proliferation and stem cell renewal in multiple tissues. Maintenance of the intestinal surface or epithelium homeostasis, for example, is dependent on Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling is also important for bone formation, retina development and function, liver regeneration and renewal of cells in the lung and pancreas among other tissues.
 We believe that several characteristics of the Wnt signaling pathway make this pathway attractive for drug development:
 •Broad potential for therapeutic intervention. Signaling through the Wnt pathway is critical in cell fate determination in tissues throughout the body. Aberrant Wnt signaling underlies a broad range of pathologies in humans. In some cases, such as in certain rare bone diseases, mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway are the cause of the disease. Mutations in Wnt signal pathway components are also associated with retina vessel disorders such as Norrie disease and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, or FEVR, tooth development disorders, and metabolic diseases including diabetes. Preclinical model studies have shown that Wnt signaling is instrumental for liver regeneration, intestine epithelium turnover and injury repair, and plays a role in maintaining residential stem cells in many more adult tissues including lung, kidney, cochlea, skin and the central nervous system.
 •Common activation mechanism across Wnt proteins. There are 19 Wnt protein genes in the human genome and the genomes of other mammals. Most Wnt proteins bind interchangeably to the 10 different Fzd receptors with little discrimination. Genetic knockouts in mice have shown that individual Wnt protein genes have distinct functions. The differences in biological functions likely arise from discrete localized expression and the relative insolubility of Wnt proteins which limits migration from the site of synthesis. On the other hand, when it comes to biochemical signaling, the different Wnt proteins have very similar activities upon target cells. This, in turn, implies that the same therapeutic approach could be used to address multiple diseases.
 •Multiple modulators of activity. Multiple modulators of the Wnt signaling pathway have been identified that activate, amplify, dampen or inhibit the pathway’s activity and limit the potential consequences of either over-activation or inhibition of Wnt signaling. These modulators can serve both as direct targets for therapeutic intervention and as examples of how novel therapeutics could be developed that mimic their action.
 The low solubility of Wnt proteins due to the required fatty acid modification limits the ability of natural Wnt proteins themselves to be developed as therapeutic agents. The lack of solubility of Wnt proteins makes them difficult to purify; difficult to formulate into an easily administered drug; and difficult to deliver to various tissues in the body. In contrast, we have developed technologies enabling us to develop activators and amplifiers of Wnt signaling which avoid the low solubility of natural Wnt proteins. These technologies trigger the Wnt pathway to act in a transient manner by mimicking the binding of Wnt proteins and other regulators of the pathway. Our goal is to use our technologies to develop therapeutics that can modulate the naturally occurring Wnt response and promote healing.
 Our Wnt Therapeutics Platform
 We have discovered two proprietary technologies of modulators of Wnt signaling: SWAP and SWEETS. We have designed and continue to design antibodies that modulate the Wnt signaling pathway by acting as mimetics of either Wnt protein or one of its regulators, R-spondin. Product candidates generated by our technologies have demonstrated the ability to repair tissue damage in multiple preclinical models including IBD and liver injuries. We were able to select a specific candidate molecule and technology for each disease area based on tissue biology, profile of Wnt signaling in disease versus normal, and functional test of molecules. We are advancing two of these candidates, SZN-1326 and SZN-043, into clinical development.
Wnt Activation: SWAP
 The Wnt pathway is equipped with binding sites for two receptors found on the surface of cells that can be triggered by Wnt protein. Binding to just one of these two receptors does not cause activation of the Wnt pathway. But when Wnt protein simultaneously binds to both receptors, this pair of interactions activates several intracellular signaling pathways, as can be seen in Figure 5 below. The two Wnt

receptors are called frizzled, or Fzd, and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 or 6, or Lrp 5/6. Fzd is an integral membrane protein that binds to Wnt protein, in part, through the fatty acid posttranslational modification on the Wnt protein. The second receptor, Lrp 5/6, contains an intracellular domain that is chemically modified by Wnt-protein-induced receptor dimerization to initiate the Wnt signaling pathway cascade in cells.
 
Figure 5. Like endogenous Wnt (left side), our SWAP technology activates Wnt signaling by binding specific Fzd and Lrp receptors (right side)
 
Published work by Dr. Christopher Garcia, one of our founders and Scientific Advisory Board members, showed that Wnt signaling could be induced by identifying non-Wnt proteins capable of selectively binding to Fzd and Lrp and linking these binding domains together. These non-Wnt proteins led to an activation of Wnt signaling that in many ways was indistinguishable from that induced by Wnt itself. Furthermore, these non-Wnt proteins were soluble and did not require posttranslational modification with fatty acid for activity. These observations revealed the opportunity to develop Wnt-mimetic therapeutics freed from the burden of containing a fatty acid, which decreases their solubility. There was no apparent restriction on the type of interacting domains that could be used to create these molecules. Several categories of molecules, including domains from natural proteins, artificial protein binding domains, and antibodies were all found to be able to function as binding domains for Fzd or Lrp.
 We have focused our efforts on developing antibody-binding domains that independently bind to Fzd and to Lrp. Antibody-binding domains provide a potential advantage over other binding domains due to the ability to identify domains with high potency and with high specificity, in addition to the maturing manufacturing process. We have identified antibody-binding domains capable of distinguishing individual Fzd family members, providing an opportunity to selectively activate Wnt signaling in cells expressing specific Fzd receptors—a property that naturally occurring Wnt proteins do not have.
 In our SWAP technology, we created multivalent bispecific antibodies that bring together two different sets of antibody-binding domains—one set that binds to Fzd and another set that binds to Lrp. We found that certain recombinant proteins containing these two antibody-binding domains were able to simultaneously bind both Fzd and Lrp, however, inducing the simple bimolecular interaction of one Fzd and one Lrp was, in most cases, insufficient to induce Wnt signaling, as can be observed in Figure 6.
 In Figure 6 below, in an assay measuring protein concentration (x-axis) against Wnt pathway activation (as measured by relative light units, or RLU, y-axis), we have demonstrated that a simple bivalent antibody containing a single Fzd binding domain (F1) (the blue

line) and a single Lrp binding domain (L2) (the red line) did not significantly induce the Wnt signaling pathway. At similar concentrations, naturally-occurring Wnt (Wnt3a) (the green line) demonstrated pathway activation.
 
Figure 6. A simple bivalent antibody containing a single Fzd binding domain (F1) and a single Lrp binding domain (L2) did not significantly induce the Wnt signaling pathway. At similar concentrations, naturally-occurring Wnt (Wnt3a) demonstrated pathway activation.
 However, multivalent antibodies that contained multiple binding domains, either two Fzd-binding domains with one Lrp binding domain (the blue line in Figure 7 below) or two of each binding domain (the light green line), led to activation of the Wnt signaling pathway at concentrations that were 100 times or lower than required for activation by Wnt3a (the dark green line), as can be observed in Figure 7. For comparison, an antibody with a single Fzd binding domain (the red line) did not demonstrate significant activity.
 
Figure 7. Multivalent antibodies with two Fzd binding domains (F3) and at least one Lrp binding domain (L2) led to more potent activation of the Wnt signaling pathway.
 We are developing a series of product candidates based on the SWAP technology, which combines binding domains for specific Fzd receptors and binding domains for specific Lrp receptors. Our current SWAP lead product candidate, SZN-1326, is being evaluated for its ability to treat moderate to severe IBD. SZN-413 is another SWAP project candidate for the treatment of retinal vascular associated diseases. In addition, we are developing other product candidates, including for the potential treatment of ocular diseases.


Wnt Amplification: SWEETS
 We have designed our SWEETS technology for those diseases that are characterized by the presence of naturally occurring Wnt, yet with insufficient Wnt signaling for specific cells. This technology allows us to target Wnt pathway activation to specific cells in the body. For this, our SWEETS technology couples the regulation of the Wnt pathway to the binding of cell-specific surface antigens.
 R-spondins are a family of four proteins that amplify Wnt pathway signals by reducing the destruction of Fzd by internalization and degradation. Proteins that are destined for degradation, such as Fzd, are normally tagged by E3 ligases. R-spondin prevents E3 ligase from tagging Fzd, thereby increasing the amount of time that Fzd remains on the cell surface. This results in an increased activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Importantly, R-spondin does not directly cause signaling through the Wnt pathway, but rather it extends or amplifies the signaling that arises from already-present naturally occurring Wnt protein.
 Wild type R-spondin activity requires binding to two cell surface proteins: the E3 ligases and a member of a family of membrane proteins, referred to as LGR 4-6. We have shown that derivatives of R-spondin can be generated that couple its E3 binding domain to an antigen-binding domain that recognizes a specific cell surface protein of our choosing resulting in R-spondin like activity. This technology creates R-spondin mimetics that can be targeted to specific cells in the body that express the chosen cell surface protein, which is illustrated in the Figure 8 below.
 
Figure 8. Our SWEETS technology leads to amplification of the Wnt signaling pathway by inhibition of Fzd degradation by the E3 ligase/proteasome pathway. Specificity of SWEETS binding is driven by an antigen-binding domain that can be targeted to specific cell surface proteins.
 In a proof-of-concept experiment conducted internally, an antibody-binding domain recognizing a cell surface protein was fused to a R-spondin protein in which the binding site for LGR 4-6 had been inactivated. This recombinant antibody R-spondin construct (the red line in “Target Cell” in Figure 9 below) stimulated the Wnt signaling pathway in cells that expressed the cell surface protein and was inactive in cells lacking the cell surface protein (the red line in “Non-Target Cell”). Wild-type R-spondin did not exhibit this selectivity and led to the Wnt signaling pathway amplification in both types of cells (the black lines in the figure below). A non-cell surface targeted molecule serving as a negative control (the blue lines in the figure below) did not demonstrate any activity.



Figure 9. Cell specificity of R-spondin was altered by inactivating the LGR 4-6 binding site and adding an antigen-binding domain for a specific cell surface protein. SWEETS shown in red.
 SZN-1326: a SWAP Product Candidate for the Treatment of moderate to severe IBD
 Our first product candidate, SZN-1326, is being developed as a novel treatment for moderate to severe IBD, with UC as our first proposed indication, and utilizes our proprietary SWAP technology to activate Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling plays a critical role in intestinal epithelial turnover and normal function. Abnormal signaling has been observed in patients with IBD and restoration of normal signaling is expected to play a role in the repair of intestinal epithelial cells in IBD. SZN-1326 targets Fzd 5, Fzd 8, and Lrp 6 to activate Wnt signaling. We have observed that Fzd 5, Fzd 8, and Lrp 6 are expressed in the large bowel epithelium UC tissue samples and that Fzd 5 is the most abundant Fzd, representing an attractive target for our therapeutic approach. We have shown that SZN-1326 has several simultaneous beneficial effects in that it:
 •activates the Wnt signaling pathway in intestinal stem cells resulting in proliferation and differentiation;
 •restores intestinal barrier function and tissue architecture;
 •decreases inflammation; and
 •reduces disease activity in mouse models of moderate to severe IBD.
 We will be re-initiating the Phase 1a clinical trial by mid-2023 based on the minimum anticipated biologically effective level (MABEL) and anticipate safety data by the end of 2023. We anticipate initiating a Phase 1b clinical trial in ulcerative colitis patients in 2024 and expect proof of concept data to be potentially available in the second half of 2024.
 Ulcerative Colitis Disease Background
 UC is a form of IBD characterized by inflammation and ulcers in the large intestine. The hallmark clinical symptoms of UC are diarrhea, bloody stool, and urgency to defecate, and its clinical course is marked by exacerbations and remissions, which may occur spontaneously or in response to dietary changes, alterations in treatment regimens, other illnesses or stress. In UC, inflammation is continuous throughout the large bowel and lacks healthy patches distributed adjacent to the inflamed tissue. The extent of disease is variable but starts at the left side (the rectum) and can involve the whole, large intestine. UC is limited to the inner most layer of the intestinal wall.
 UC can be debilitating with frequent diarrhea, bloody stools, weight loss, dehydration, and anemia. Intestinal complications from severe and chronic inflammation can become life-threatening. Patients with active disease are more likely to suffer psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression and are more likely to have impaired social interactions. Persistent UC is associated with an increased risk of developing colon cancer. It is estimated that there are two million individuals in the United States with IBD, of which roughly half have UC. An even higher number of individuals in Europe are estimated to have UC.
 UC is typically treated with anti-inflammatory drugs. The typical treatment regimen begins with fairly mild and locally-delivered drugs and progresses to stronger systemic immunosuppressive drugs that are only prescribed for patients with moderate to severe disease. First-line therapy for patients with mild disease consists of locally delivered or oral 5-aminosalicylates such as mesalamine and sulfasalazine, or corticosteroids. This is done with the intent of inducing remission and transitioning patients to drugs such as 5-aminosalicylates for maintenance. Patients with moderate to severe disease will usually be treated first-line with anti-inflammatory biologics such as infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab. Infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab are antibodies directed against tumor necrosis factor alpha, or TNFα, an inflammatory cytokine secreted during acute inflammation. However, over time, many patients lose responsiveness to these anti-TNF antibodies and approximately 20% do not initially respond to this treatment. Patients

non-responsive to anti-TNFα antibody therapy are instead treated with other approved biologics such as ustekinumab, an inhibitor of interleukin 12 and interleukin 23, and vedolizumab, an integrin inhibitor or with a JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib, an oral anti-inflammatory.
 Despite the availability of a number of approved drugs and validated drug targets, many patients with moderate to severe UC have an inadequate or slow response to therapy, lose responsiveness, or cannot tolerate existing treatments. For example, up to 20% of patients do not respond to anti-TNF antibodies and 10% to 15% lose responsiveness every year despite initial benefit. Overall, it is estimated that less than half of moderate to severe UC patients are in clinical remission. Approximately 70% of patients with active disease in a given year will have another episode in the following year. Once a patient has successfully been treated and is in remission, the longer the patient is in remission, the less likely he or she is to experience a flare-up in the following year. A potential factor driving longer-term remissions is the repair of the intestinal barrier and absence of any inflammatory activity in the large intestine gut wall.
 Crohn’s Disease Background
 Crohn’s disease, or CD, is a chronic inflammatory disease that most commonly affects the end of the small intestine and the beginning of the large intestine, although it may involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Like UC, CD is a type of IBD and many of the symptoms and demographics overlap. In addition to the potential of CD developing in other segments of the intestine, CD differs from UC in that there can be normal healthy tissue between patches of diseased tissue. CD can also occur in all layers of the intestinal wall unlike UC which is limited to the inner most layer. It is estimated that there are approximately 1 million individuals in the United States and approximately 1.1 million individuals in Europe with CD.
 The treatment paradigm for CD is very similar to that of UC. Currently approved therapies are mostly anti-inflammatory agents. It is estimated that 60% of patients have moderate to severe disease and will eventually require surgery to treat complications such as fistulas (abnormal connections between body parts), life-threatening bleeding, and intestinal obstructions.
 The Wnt Signaling Pathway and its Role in IBD
 Although the two most common forms of IBD, UC and CD, are treated with anti-inflammatory agents, the root cause of these diseases has been proposed to be an impaired intestinal barrier that occurs due to initial damages by genetic, environmental, inflammatory or other factors. This impairment is thought to allow bacteria to penetrate through the intestinal epithelium, leading both to immune cell activation and to an inflammatory reaction that exacerbates the damage.
 The intestinal epithelium is one of the fastest proliferating tissues in adults, being largely made anew every four to five days. The wall of the small intestine is made up of villi, finger-like projections that extend into the lumen of the intestine, which greatly increase the surface area available for nutrient absorption. The cells at the tips of these villi are continuously shed and are replenished by cells that originate from stem cells located at the base of the villus, called the intestinal crypts. The colon (large intestine) wall is made up of a lining of columnar epithelial cells with pouches called colonic crypts. Similar to the small intestine villi, the stem cells are located at the base of colonic crypts, as shown in Figure 10, below. The Wnt signaling pathway is critical for the renewal and proliferation of these stem cells. Inactivation of the Wnt signaling pathway blocks stem cell proliferation and differentiation causing a rapid loss of intestinal epithelial cells in mice. Figure 10 below illustrates how the Wnt signaling pathway potentially stimulates stem cell renewal and proliferation in colonic crypts leading to increased turnover of epithelial cells.



Figure 10. Wnt signaling pathway stimulates stem cell renewal and proliferation leading to increased synthesis and turnover of epithelial cells
 There is direct evidence linking dysregulation in the Wnt signaling pathway to the development of moderate to severe IBD in patients and deficiency in the Wnt signaling pathway has been associated not only with the reduced turnover of stem cells in the intestinal crypt but also with a reduced production of cells that secrete anti-bacterial proteins. It has been proposed that transient elevations in the Wnt signaling pathway may be beneficial in wound healing and evidence from mouse IBD models provide further support for treatment with a Wnt signal activator. The Wnt protein inhibitor Dkk1 is induced by inflammatory cytokines in colitis and, in mice, blocking Dkk1 function resulted in elevated Wnt signaling and the promotion of wound repair.
 Our Solution: SZN-1326
 Our product candidate, SZN-1326, is a Wnt protein mimetic based on our SWAP technology, for the treatment of moderate to severe IBD. Our goal for SZN-1326 was to create a Wnt protein mimetic that could specifically support the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells in the damaged intestinal or colonic crypts of patients with moderate to severe IBD. We believe that treatment with SZN-1326 has the potential to accelerate the repair of the intestinal barrier, which can result in a reduction of bacteria penetrating through the intestinal epithelium and a reduction of immune cell activation and inflammation, thereby treating IBD. Figure 11 below demonstrates how SZN-1326 potentially binds to Fzd5/8 and Lrp6 on intestinal stem cells to activate Wnt signaling.



Figure 11: SZN-1326 binds to Fzd5/8 and Lrp6 on intestinal stem cells to activate Wnt signaling
 
Selective Wnt Pathway Activation
 SZN-1326 is a bispecific antibody targeting Fzd5/8 and Lrp6. Fzd5 was reported to be highly expressed in intestinal mucosal cells from IBD patients. Our research found that Fzd5, was also highly expressed in a mouse model of colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate, or DSS, as shown in Figure 12. In this model, DSS exposure leads to disruption of the intestinal barrier resulting in an inflammatory response similar to that seen in IBD patients. We identified SZN-1326 through testing of multiple SWAP antibodies both in naïve and injured intestinal tissue and in DSS models.
 
Figure 12. Fzd5 is highly expressed in intestinal tissue from a DSS mouse model
 We have shown that SZN-1326 can stimulate Wnt signal activation in DSS-injured intestine epithelial cells as measured by the expression of Axin2, a downstream target gene in the Wnt pathway.
 Restoration of Epithelial Tight Junctions


Mice exposed to DSS for seven days led to the breakdown of the intestinal barrier, which can be readily visualized in stained cross sections of the colon, as shown in Figure 13. In the absence of DSS, there is an intact intestinal wall and the crypts are tightly packed to form a continuous structure. Exposure to DSS followed by treatment with a negative control antibody, anti-GFP, resulted in several effects: a breakdown of the intestinal wall; shrinkage of the crypts; and the creation of multiple discontinuous segments by day ten. However, DSS-exposed mice treated with SZN-1326, administered on days four and seven, led to a dose-dependent repair of this damage, with a dose of 1 mg/kg or higher restoring most of the damage visible by histology. Similar results were observed in a chronic model of DSS, as can be seen in Figure 13.
 
Figure 13. SZN-1326 administration led to the restoration of the intestinal epithelium in a DSS model
 The degree of epithelial repair as measured by histology with SZN-1326 was greater than what we obtained in additional experiments with cyclosporine, an anti-TNF antibody or an anti-IL12/23 antibody.
 Histologic staining showed that treatment with SZN-1326 led to the restoration of tight junctions, the cell-to-cell structures that create the intestinal barrier that prevents the free flow of material. In healthy intestinal tissue, the zonula occludens 1 protein, or ZO-1, a component of tight junctions, was found as a continuous layer along the intestinal wall. In DSS-damaged intestinal tissue, no such barrier

was observed. Treatment with SZN-1326 restored ZO-1 localization as a continuous layer along the intestinal wall, as can be observed in Figure 14.
 
Figure 14. SZN-1326 restored ZO-1 localization (green) and reestablishment of the intestinal barrier in a DSS mouse model.
 
Inflammation Reduction
 The breakdown of the intestinal barrier triggers an inflammatory response that leads to further tissue damage. Disease modification in IBD can be measured by the levels of inflammatory cytokines present in the injured tissue and in serum. In the mouse DSS model, treatment with SZN-1326 administration led to a significant dose-dependent decrease in a number of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, interleukin-6, or IL-6, and interleukin-8, or IL-8. Reductions in cytokine levels were observed both in colon tissue and in serum, as can be seen in Figure 15 below. We believe that these results suggest that SZN-1326 not only has the potential of directly repairing the epithelium but also, as a result, of reducing inflammation.
 
Figure 15. SZN-1326 administration led to significant reductions in cytokine levels in a DSS mouse model. (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001)
 In the description of the preclinical studies above and throughout, a p-value represents the probability that random chance caused the result. For example, a p-value of 0.001 means that there is a 0.1% probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance. A p-value of less than or equal to 0.05 is a commonly used threshold for identifying statistically significant outcomes. The FDA’s evidentiary standard of efficacy when evaluating the results of a clinical trial generally relies on a p-value of less than or equal to 0.05.
 

Functional Improvement
 Most importantly, SZN-1326 administration led to an improvement in the disease activity index, or DAI, in the DSS model. The DAI is a composite score composed of body weight change, diarrhea, and bloody stools that is frequently used to quantify disease severity. SZN-1326 treatments led to a dose dependent decrease in DAI which was superior to that which we observed with cyclosporine, an anti-TNF antibody, or an anti-IL12/23 antibody in acute and chronic DS models, respectively. Figure 16 below demonstrates that SZN-1326 administration led to improvements in DAI in an acute DSS model.
 
Figure 16. SZN-1326 administration led to improvement in the disease activity index in an acute DSS model. (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001)
 Clinical Development of SZN-1326
 We intend to re-initiate the Phase 1a clinical trial by mid-2023. Our trial focuses on assessing safety and tolerability as well as on obtaining human pharmacokinetic data in healthy volunteers. We intend to conduct a multiple ascending dose trial in patients with moderate to severe UC in 2024 with the goal of assessing safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and initial signs of clinical activity through the effects on stool frequency, rectal bleeding, cytokines, biomarkers, and endoscopic and histological changes in the colon. We anticipate that later stage trials would include the induction of clinical and histological remission, either alone or in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs. Based both on the mechanism of action of SZN-1326 and our preclinical results, we believe that dosing of SZN-1326 for several weeks has the potential to demonstrate durable remissions. If we obtain initial signs of efficacy in UC, we anticipate also initiating clinical development in CD.
 SZN-043, a SWEETS product candidate for the treatment of severe liver diseases
 SZN-043 is our product candidate in development for severe alcoholic hepatitis, or AH. SZN-043, a hepatocyte-specific R-spondin mimetic bispecific fusion protein targeting ASGR1, is the first development candidate using Surrozen’s SWEETS technology which is designed to mimic the regenerative properties of the protein R-Spondin by enhancing Wnt signaling in a cell-targeted manner. We have shown that SZN-043 activates Wnt signaling in hepatocytes and contributes both to increasing hepatocyte proliferation and to restoring liver function. We opened enrollment for the Phase 1a clinical trial in chronic liver disease patients, enrolled the first patient in the first quarter of 2023 and expect data to be available in the second half of 2023. We anticipate initiating a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis in 2024.
 Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis Background
 AH is inflammation of the liver caused by excessive alcohol ingestion. AH is most likely to occur in people who drink heavily over many years; however, the relationship between drinking and alcoholic hepatitis is complex.
 Not all heavy drinkers develop alcoholic hepatitis, and the disease can occur in people who drink only moderately. AH is characterized by the rapid onset of jaundice, malaise, anorexia, liver enlargement and a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, or SIRS. AH is characterized by impaired hepatocyte proliferation. In these patients, higher Wnt signaling and hepatocyte proliferation have been associated with better outcomes.
 Many patients with severe AH require inpatient hospitalization due to the high risk of developing renal failure, liver failure, infections and the effects of alcohol withdrawal. AH is treated with anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids, typically prednisolone.

Glucocorticoid treatment requires close monitoring because of the increased risk of infections, glucose intolerance and gastrointestinal bleeding. For patients who respond to glucocorticoids, the duration of treatment is typically 28 days. Mortality rates after one to six months among patients treated with glucocorticoids in clinical trials ranged from approximately 20% to 40%. The effectiveness of glucocorticoid treatment is controversial. A 2017 meta-analysis of 15 randomized trials found that glucocorticoid treatment did not significantly lower mortality rates compared to placebo. In addition, only 25% to 45% of patients are eligible for glucocorticoid therapy due to other comorbidities. Those not qualifying include patients with infections, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, renal failure, and active gastrointestinal bleeding. Although levels of TNFα are highly elevated in AH, treatment with anti-TNFα antibodies has not been determined to be effective. The overall 30-day mortality rate in patients hospitalized with AH is approximately 15% and the 90-day rate is approximately 30%.
 There are an estimated 130,000 unique AH-related hospitalizations annually in the United States. Alcoholism affects an estimated 8% of the U.S. population and between 10% and 35% of alcoholics have characteristics consistent with the development of AH.
 Our Solution: SZN-043
 We are developing SZN-043, a tissue-selective R-spondin mimetic based on our SWEETS technology, for the treatment of severe liver disease. Our goal was to create a molecule that could stimulate liver regeneration by amplifying the effect of naturally occurring Wnt proteins. SZN-043 is a bispecific antibody that mimics the stimulatory effect of R-spondin specifically on hepatocytes through targeting of asialoglycoprotein receptor 1, or ASGR1. Liver regeneration has been shown to be an important predictor and biomarker for disease severity, response to corticosteroids and patient survival in those with severe AH. We believe that the regenerative capacity that SZN-043 has shown in preclinical models will potentially improve the outcome of patients with severe AH. Figure 17 below describes the proposed mechanism of action of SZN-043.
 

Figure 17. In liver injury, SZN-043 amplifies the regenerative activity of endogenous Wnts by stabilizing their Fzd receptors on hepatocytes
 
Selective Wnt Pathway Activation
 Similar to R-spondin, SZN-043 leads to an amplification of Wnt signaling by inhibiting internalization and degradation of Fzd. However, an important difference from R-spondin is that SZN-043 requires binding to ASGR1, a protein that is exclusively expressed on hepatocytes, for activity. A single dose of SZN-043 at 10 mg/kg led to the amplification of the Wnt signaling pathway, as measured by Axin2 expression, a common indicator of Wnt signaling activity, in mouse liver, but not in any of the other tissues analyzed. In a similar

experiment, R-spondin at 10 mg/kg led to Wnt pathway activation in multiple tissues including liver, lung, stomach, intestines, and pancreas, as can be seen in Figure 18 below.
 

Figure 18. R-spondin (R-spo2) significantly increased Axin2 expression in many tissues, whereas SZN-043 only increases Axin2 expression in the liver. (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001)
 
Hepatocyte Proliferation
 Mice treated with a single dose of SZN-043 had significantly increased proliferation of hepatocytes at 48 hours as measured by Ki-67 expression (green signal in Figure 19 below), a nuclear protein that is associated with, and used as, a cellular marker of proliferation. Treatment with SZN-043 led to an increased number of hepatocytes that express hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, or HNF4α (red signal in Figure 19, below), a master regulator of hepatic differentiation that is critical to the regulation of liver differentiation and development. In Figure 19, a yellow signal results from the merging of a green and red signal, indicating that the proliferating cells are hepatocytes.
 
Figure 19. SZN-043 led to increased proliferation and differentiation of hepatocytes in mice. (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001)
 Functional Improvement
 High levels of ammonia in the blood, a condition known as hyperammonemia, is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and a sign of severe liver disease. Ammonia levels have been shown to predict mortality in patients with acute hepatitis. Acute liver failure patients who have decreased ammonia levels have improved survival. Measurement of ammonia levels is a standard clinical test used to screen for liver function and follow progression of liver disease.


Elevated ammonia levels are also observed in a mouse model of AH. In this model, AH is induced by seven weeks of a binge ethanol diet. After seven weeks, the ethanol diet is suspended, and liver injury is assessed. Treatment with SZN-043 significantly lowered ammonia levels in this model by day three, as shown in Figure 20.
 
Figure 20. SZN-043 treatment significantly reduced ammonia levels in an alcoholic hepatitis mouse model. (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001)
 Clinical Development of SZN-043
 We completed enrollment in the second cohort of the SZN-043 Phase 1a single ascending dose clinical trial in healthy volunteers in 2022. We opened enrollment for the Phase 1a clinical trial in chronic liver disease patients, enrolled the first patient in the first quarter of 2023 and expect data to be available in the second half of 2023. This single ascending dose Phase 1a study assesses pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability, and pharmacodynamic markers. We anticipate conducting a clinical trial in patients with severe AH in 2024 with the primary endpoints of safety and pharmacokinetics and exploratory efficacy endpoints consisting of the Lille and MELD scores. The Lille model is a highly predictive measure of likelihood of death at three and six months calculated by taking into account patient age, renal insufficiency, albumin, prothrombin time, bilirubin, and evolution of bilirubin at day seven. The MELD score is a separate prognostic scoring system that is used to predict the three-month mortality due to liver disease based on laboratory parameters such as creatinine, bilirubin, and INR measurements. Based on our estimates of the prevalence of severe AH, we are exploring whether SZN-043 may qualify for orphan drug designation or fast track designation or both, which may accelerate its path towards potential regulatory approval.

 Collaboration and Licensing Arrangements
Collaboration and License Agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH
 In October 2022, we executed the CLA with BI to research, develop and commercialize Fzd4 bi-specific antibodies designed using the Company’s SWAP technology, including SZN-413. We and BI are conducting partnership research focused on SZN-413 during a one-year period, which BI has the right to extend by up to six months. We granted BI an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide, sublicensable license, under our applicable patents and know-how, to develop, manufacture and commercialize, for all uses, one lead and two back-up Fzd4 bi-specific antibodies selected by BI and their derivatives. After an initial period of joint research, BI shall be responsible for all further research, preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory approvals, and commercialization of licensed products at its expense. For five years after the effective date of the CLA, we are prohibited from preclinically and clinically developing

or commercializing Fzd4 bi-specific antibodies for any diseases of the eye, and BI is prohibited from clinically developing or commercializing licensed products for any purpose other than diseases of the eye. Unless terminated earlier or expiring on account of BI not selecting at least one Fzd4 bi-specific antibody within sixty days after the end of the partnership research, the CLA will remain effective, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, until the expiration of BI's royalty obligations. BI has the right to terminate the CLA for any reason after a specified notice period. Each party has the right to terminate the CLA on account of the other party’s bankruptcy or material, uncured breach. Under the terms of the CLA, BI paid a non-refundable upfront payment of $12.5 million less applicable withholding tax and we are eligible to receive success-based milestone payments up to a total of $587.0 million and mid-single digit to low-double digit royalties on net sales of the licensed products should any reach commercialization. The royalty payments will be subject to reduction due to patent expiration, generic competition and payments made under certain licenses for third-party intellectual property.
Stanford License Agreements
 In March 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Stanford University, or the 2016 Stanford Agreement, which was amended in July 2016, October 2016 and January 2021, pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable license under certain patents, rights, or licensed patents and technology related to our engineered Wnt surrogate molecules to make, use, import, offer to sell and sell products that are claimed by the licensed patents or that use or incorporate such technology, or licensed products, for the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of human and veterinary diseases. The 2016 Stanford Agreement covers two patent families and any patents that grant from these families are predicted to expire in 2035 and 2037, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. In consideration for this license, we paid Stanford a nominal upfront fee and issued an aggregate of 42,451 shares of our common stock to Stanford, the University of Washington and two co-inventors of the licensed patents. In addition, we agreed to pay Stanford nominal annual license maintenance fees which are creditable against earned royalties owed to Stanford for the same year, an aggregate of up to $0.9 million for the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones, and an aggregate of up to $5.0 million for the achievement of specified sales milestones. Stanford is also entitled to receive royalties from us equal to a very low single digit percentage of our and our sublicensees’ net sales of licensed products that are covered by a valid claim of a licensed patent. Our obligation to pay royalties will continue, on a country-by-country basis, until the last-to-expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering a licensed product in the country of manufacture or sale. Additionally, we agreed to pay Stanford a sub-teen double digit percentage of certain consideration we receive as a result of granting sublicenses to the licensed patents. However, we and Stanford may be able to negotiate a lower non-royalty sublicense percentage based on the then-current value of the licensed patents for each sublicense product. If we are acquired, we agreed to pay a one-time change of control fee in the low six figures. Stanford retains the right under the 2016 Stanford Agreement, on behalf of itself, Stanford Hospital and Clinics, the University of Washington and all other non-profit research institutions, to practice the licensed patents and technology for any non-profit purpose. The licensed patents and technology are additionally subject to a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license held by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to practice the licensed patents and technology for its research purposes, but with no right to assign or sublicense.
 In June 2018, we entered into another license agreement with Stanford, or the 2018 Stanford Agreement, pursuant to which we obtained from Stanford, a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable license under certain patent rights related to our surrogate R-spondin proteins, or licensed patents, to make, use, import, offer to sell and sell products that are claimed by the licensed patents, or licensed products, for the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of human and veterinary diseases, or the exclusive field. The 2018 Stanford Agreement covers one patent family, and any patents that grant from this family are predicted to expire in 2038, absent any patent term adjustment or extension. Additionally, Stanford granted us a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable license under the licensed patents to make and use licensed products for research and development purposes in furtherance of the exclusive field and a worldwide, non-exclusive license to make, use and import, but not to offer to sell or sell, licensed products in any other field of use. In consideration of these licenses, we paid Stanford a nominal upfront fee. We also agreed to pay Stanford nominal annual license maintenance fees which are creditable against earned royalties owed to Stanford for the same year, and an aggregate of up to $0.4 million for the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones. Stanford is also entitled to receive royalties from us equal to a sub-single digit percentage of our and our sublicensees’ net sales of licensed products that are covered by a valid claim of a licensed patent. Our obligation to pay royalties will continue, on a country-by-country basis, until the last-to-expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering a licensed product in the country of manufacture or sale. Additionally, we agreed to pay Stanford a one-time payment in the low six figures for each sublicense of the licensed patents that we grant to a third party and, if we are acquired, a one-time nominal change of control fee. Stanford retains the right under the 2018 Stanford Agreement, on behalf of itself, Stanford Health Care, Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford, and all other non-profit research institutions, to practice the licensed patents for any non-profit purpose. The licensed patents are additionally subject to a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license held by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to exercise any intellectual property rights with respect to the licensed patents for research purposes, including the right to sublicense to non-profit and governmental entities but with no other rights to assign or sublicense.
 Under each of the 2016 Stanford Agreement and the 2018 Stanford Agreement, or Stanford Agreements, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products and we agreed to achieve certain funding and development milestones by certain dates. Unless earlier terminated, each Stanford Agreement will continue until the expiration of the patents licensed under such Stanford Agreement. We may terminate either Stanford Agreement at any time for any reason by providing at least 30 days’ written

notice to Stanford. Stanford may terminate either Stanford Agreement if we breach certain provisions of that Stanford Agreement and fail to remedy such breach within 90 days after written notice of the breach by Stanford.
 
UCSF License and Option Agreements
 
In September and October 2016, we entered into two license and option agreements with UCSF, or the UCSF Agreements, pursuant to which we obtained exclusive licenses from UCSF for internal research and antibody discovery purposes and an option to negotiate with UCSF to obtain an exclusive license under UCSF’s rights in the applicable library to make, use, sell, offer for sale and import products incorporating antibodies identified or resulting from our use of such library, or licensed products. Our SZN-1326 candidate comprises a VHH domain isolated from the licensed UCSF single domain antibody library. In consideration for the license and option rights under each UCSF Agreement, we paid UCSF a nominal option issue fee and agreed to pay UCSF a nominal annual option maintenance fee.
 
In January 2020, we amended and restated the UCSF Agreements to provide non-exclusive licenses to make and use a certain human Fab naïve phage display library and to make and use a certain phage display llama VHH single domain antibody library for internal research and antibody discovery purposes and an option to negotiate with UCSF to obtain a non-exclusive license under UCSF’s rights in the applicable library to make, use, sell, offer for sale and import products incorporating antibodies identified or resulting from our use of such library, or licensed products.

In March 2022, we exercised the option under the UCSF Agreements and entered into a non-exclusive commercial license agreement to make and use licensed products derived from the phage display llama VHH single domain antibody library. Under the commercial license agreement, the Company paid UCSF a nominal license issue fee and agreed to pay a nominal annual license maintenance fee, five- to six-digit payments per licensed product upon achievement of a regulatory milestone, nominal minimum annual royalties, and earned royalties equal to a sub-single digit percentage of the Company’s and the Company’s sublicensees’ net sales of licensed products.
 
Unless earlier terminated, each UCSF Agreement will continue until four years from its execution date and we may exercise the option to negotiate a commercial license at any time during that term. Additionally, we may extend each UCSF Agreement for an additional four years by paying UCSF a nominal term extension fee. We may terminate either UCSF Agreement at any time for any reason by providing at least 60 days’ written notice to UCSF. UCSF may terminate either UCSF Agreement if UCSF reasonably believes we are in material breach of such UCSF Agreement and we fail to remedy such breach within 60 days after written notice of such breach given by UCSF. Additionally, the UCSF Agreements will automatically terminate in the event of our bankruptcy.
 Distributed Bio Subscription Agreement
 
In September 2016, we entered into, and in January 2019 we amended, an antibody library subscription agreement with Distributed Bio, Inc., or Distributed Bio (Distributed Bio has since been acquired by Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.). In this antibody library subscription agreement, or the Distributed Bio Agreement, we obtained from Distributed Bio a non-exclusive license to use Distributed Bio’s antibody library to identify antibodies directed to an unlimited number of our proprietary targets and to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and exploit products incorporating the antibodies that we identify, or licensed products. Our SZN-1326 candidate incorporates a binding component isolated from the Distributed Bio antibody library. In consideration for the rights granted to us under the Distributed Bio Agreement, we paid Distributed Bio a nominal upfront fee and an additional nominal fee upon entering into the amendment. We agreed to pay Distributed Bio an annual fee in the low six figures after the first three years. Additionally, we agreed to pay Distributed Bio an aggregate of $5.9 million for each licensed product that achieves specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and royalties equal to a very low single digit percentage of our and our sublicensees’ net sales of licensed products. Our obligation to pay royalties will end for each licensed product ten years after its first commercial sale.
 
Unless earlier terminated, the Distributed Bio Agreement will continue for an initial four-year term and will thereafter automatically renew for additional one-year terms. We may terminate the Distributed Bio Agreement for convenience at any time by providing written notice to Distributed Bio. We and Distributed Bio may terminate the Distributed Bio Agreement for the other party’s material breach and failure to cure such breach within 60 days after notice of such breach.
 
Patents and Other Proprietary Rights
 As of December 31, 2022, our patent portfolio consisted of over 20 pending patent application families, including 15 families that have entered national phase in the United States and other countries, three families with pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications, some of which have also been filed in certain non-PCT countries (e.g., Taiwan), and five families with pending U.S. provisional applications. These patent applications are directed to, for example, the SWAP and SWEETS platforms, the parental constructs of our two lead product candidate molecules, SZN-043 and SZN-1326, the recently out-licensed SZN-413, as well as methods of treating disorders of the liver, intestine, retina, cornea, and lacrimal gland.
SWAP Platform Technology
 As of December 31, 2022, we solely own or exclusively license 15 patent families related to our SWAP platform. These patent families are directed to compositions of matter and/or methods of use, and relate to Wnt mimetics that bind to both a FZD receptor and an LRP receptor, and binding domains and uses thereof. Any patents that issue from these patent families are predicted to expire between 2035 and 2042 absent any patent term adjustment or extension.
 We have exclusively licensed two patent families from The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, or Stanford, related to our SWAP platform. One patent family has been allowed or granted in Australia, Europe, Japan and the United States and is pending in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Japan, and any patents that grant from this patent family are predicted to expire in 2035 absent any patent term adjustment or extension. The other patent family is pending in the United States, and any patents that grant from this patent family are predicted to expire in 2037 absent any patent term adjustment or extension.
 Our exclusively owned patent families related to our SWAP platform include six patent families related to compositions of matter and/or methods of use relevant to SZN-1326. Two of these patent families are filed in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong and Japan, and any patents that grant from these patent families are predicted to expire in 2038 absent any patent term adjustment or extension. One is filed in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, and Japan, and any patents that grant from these patent families are predicted to expire in 2038 absent any patent term adjustment or extension. One application is filed in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, and Japan, and any patents that grant from this application is predicted to expire in 2039 absent any patent term adjustment or extension. One application is filed in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, and any patents that grant from this application is predicted to expire in 2040 absent any patent term adjustment or extension. Another has been filed as a PCT application and a Taiwan application, and any patents that grant from these applications are predicted to expire in 2042. Other exclusively owned patent families related to the SWAP program are directed to compositions of matter and/or methods of use relevant to potential future product candidates. They include: one patent family filed in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, the Republic of Korea, and Japan; one patent family filed in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, and Japan; one patent family filed in United States, Australia, Canada, China, and Japan; one pending PCT application and corresponding pending applications also filed in United States, Lebanon, Taiwan, and Argentina; one pending PCT application; and two provisional applications. Any patents that grant from these patent families related to the SWAP program are predicted to expire between 2040 and 2043 absent any patent term adjustment or extension.
 SWEETS Platform Technology
 As of December 31, 2022, we solely own or exclusively license five patent families related to our SWEETS platform. These patent families are directed to compositions of matter and methods of use of SWEETS molecules, and relate to tissue-selective R-spondin mimetics and binding domains and uses thereof. Any patents that grant from these patent families are predicted to expire between 2038 and 2041 absent any patent term adjustment or extension.
 We have exclusively licensed one patent family from Stanford related to our SWEETS platform. This patent family is filed in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, and Japan, and any patents that grant from this patent family are predicted to expire in 2038 absent any patent term adjustment or extension.
 Our solely owned patent families related to our SWEETS platform include three patent families related to compositions of matter and/or methods of use relevant to SZN-043. Two of these patent families have been filed in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, and Japan, and any patents that grant from these patent families are predicted to expire in 2038 or 2039 absent any patent term adjustment or extension. The other patent family directed to SZN-043 composition of matter and methods of use was filed as PCT and Taiwan patent applications, and any patents that grant from national stage applications resulting from these applications are predicted to expire in 2041 absent any patent term adjustment or extension. We also filed a US provisional application encompassing antibodies that bind to components of SZN-043 and method of use related to quantification of and release assays for SZN-043. Any patents that grant from any related national stage applications are predicted to expire in 2043. We plan on filing additional applications on any improvements or modifications of SZN-043 and methods of use thereof.
 The actual term of any patent that may issue from the above-described patent applications claiming one of our product candidates could be longer than described above due to patent term adjustment or patent term extension, if available, or shorter if we are required to file terminal disclaimers. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country.
 Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the

United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 Furthermore, we may rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our product candidates or processes, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future product candidates may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties have prepared and filed patent applications prior to March 16, 2013 in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO, to determine priority of invention. For more information, please see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities and other academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of therapies aimed at treating autoimmune, inflammatory, metabolic, and other diseases. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience and price, the level of competition and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. If any of our product candidates are approved and successfully commercialized, it is likely that we will face increased competition as a result of other companies pursuing development of products to address similar diseases.
 With respect to SZN-1326, there are no FDA-approved therapeutics targeted towards the Wnt signaling pathway for the treatment of IBD. There are currently oral and biologic therapeutics approved for the treatment of IBD marketed by Johnson & Johnson, Amgen Inc., Abbvie Inc., Takeda, Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer Inc., in addition to other major pharmaceutical companies, against which our product candidate may compete, if approved. In addition, we are aware of product candidates under development targeting epithelial barrier repair for the treatment of IBD, including from Applied Molecular Transport (AMT-126) in Phase 1. Other epithelial barrier repair programs include TP-317 by Thetis Pharmaceuticals, an oral therapeutic designed to deliver Resolvin E1 to the gastrointestinal tract in Phase 1.
 We are aware of product candidates under development for AH and liver failure. Durect Corp is investigating DUR-928 in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial in patients with severe AH, Intercept is investigating INT-787 in a Phase 2a clinical trial in subjects with severe AH and Akaza Bioscience is preparing to investigate resatorvid (TAK-242) in a Phase 2 clinical trial of subjects with grade 1 or 2 acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Evive has completed a Phase 1b study with F-652 a recombinant fusion protein containing human interleukin 22 (IL-22) in alcoholic hepatitis.
 With respect to our earlier stage research programs, we are aware of one FDA-approved treatment targeting the Wnt pathway. Evenity (romosozumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting sclerostin and currently marketed by Amgen Inc. and UCB for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Ankasa Regenerative Therapeutics, Inc. is developing a liposomal formulation of recombinant human

Wnt3A protein, that is applied ex vivo, to harvested autologous bone grafts (autograft) to enhance the osteogenic properties of the autograft prior to reimplantation in orthopedic surgeries. Frequency Therapeutics is developing a therapeutic product focused on the underlying cause of sensorineural hearing loss by activating progenitor cells to regenerate hair cells. AntlerA Therapeutics is a preclinical stage company developing Wnt antibody-like molecules (ANTs) that activate specific Fzd receptor complexes and are designed to control tissue stem cells and promote tissue repair and rejuvenation.
 For additional information on the competitive risks we face, please see the section of this Report titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We face competition from entities that have developed or may develop product candidates for the treatment of the diseases that we may target...”
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological products, such as our product candidates and any future product candidates. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
Regulatory Approval in the United StatesIn the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 
•completion of extensive preclinical laboratory and animal studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be commenced;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety, purity and potency of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, after completion of all clinical trials;
 •payment of any user fees for FDA review of the BLA;
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the application for review;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic, or components thereof, will be produced to assess compliance with current cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •satisfactory completion of any potential FDA audits of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA to assure compliance with GCPs and integrity of the clinical data; and
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
 

Preclinical StudiesBefore testing any biological product candidates in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.Clinical TrialsThe clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCPs, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated in the trial. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Information about certain clinical trials, including clinical trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Disclosure of the results of these clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances.A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA. The FDA will accept a well- designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the clinical trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
For purposes of BLA submission and approval, clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, which may overlap or be combined:
 
•Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the product candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness.
 •Phase 2 clinical trials generally involve studies conducted in a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
 •Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy of the product for its intended use, further evaluate its safety and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the biologic.
 

Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 and other types of clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the trial.Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.FDA Review ProcessesAssuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States.The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, each BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. The applicant under an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee.The FDA reviews a submitted BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing and may request additional information from the sponsor. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with any additional information requested. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. Under the goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether such facilities comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the data supporting safety, purity, and potency of the product candidate. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it generally considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions on approval.

After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product is produced, it will issue either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the BLA and may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months from receipt, depending on the type of information included. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may require a REMS to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks to patients. A REMS is a safety strategy implemented to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure a product’s safe use, or ETASU. An ETASU can include, but is not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing the product, dispensing the product only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient-specific registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. Orphan Drug DesignationUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation on its own does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.Among the benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. In addition, if a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same product for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication. In the latter case, because healthcare professionals are free to prescribe products for off-label uses, the competitor’s product could be used for the orphan indication despite another product’s orphan exclusivity.A designated orphan drug many not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.Expedited Development and Review ProgramsThe FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. For example, fast track designation may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and where preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease condition. Fast track designation applies to combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a biological

product candidate can request the FDA to designate the candidate for a specific indication for fast track status concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the biologic candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Breakthrough therapy designation may be granted for products that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the biologic candidate. The FDA must determine if the biological product qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review process, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to design the clinical studies in an efficient manner. The designation also includes all of the fast track program features, including eligibility for rolling review of BLA submissions if the relevant criteria are met.Priority review may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review).Accelerated approval may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and that generally provide a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments. A product eligible for accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large studies to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. The accelerated approval pathway is contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. These confirmatory trials must be completed with due diligence and, in some cases, the FDA may require that the trial be designed, initiated and/or fully enrolled prior to approval. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.Additional Controls for BiologicsTo help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the

manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.Pediatric InformationUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), BLAs or supplements to BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA generally does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. PREA applies to BLAs for orphan-designated biologics if the biologic is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA has determined is substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) provides a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a biologic if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new biologic in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.Post-Approval RequirementsAny products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain additional post-approval requirements.The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, may impose a REMS and/or post-market surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, including those focused on manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs.Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning or other enforcement-related letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;


•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.Biosimilars and Reference Product ExclusivityThe Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.Under the BPCIA an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product.
International Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, a variety of foreign regulations govern clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country and the time to approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations and Legislative ReformHealthcare Laws and Regulations
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our operations, including any arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws that may affect the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would market, sell and distribute our products. Our

current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to CMS, HHS (including the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Services Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. The healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:
 •The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has also been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. Additionally, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
 •Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, such as the False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false, fictitious or fraudulent claims for payment of federal funds, and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Drug manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the False Claims Act in connection with their alleged off-label promotion of drugs, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, and allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;
 •The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, among other things, imposes criminal liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
 •HIPAA, as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which impose privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon entities subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, known as covered entities, and their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;
 •Federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;
 •The federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Affordable Care Act, which requires, among other things, certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests, including such ownership and investment interests held by a physician’s immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will 


extend to include payments and transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners;
 •Federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs;
 •State and foreign laws that are analogous to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may impose similar or more prohibitive restrictions, and may apply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; and
 •State and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs, comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians and other healthcare providers; state laws that require the reporting of marketing expenditures or drug pricing, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state laws that prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals; state laws that require the posting of information relating to clinical trials and their outcomes; and other federal, state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information or personally identifiable information in certain circumstances, including state health information privacy and data breach notification laws which govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus requiring additional compliance efforts.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other current or future healthcare laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could substantially disrupt our operations. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. In addition, if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.Legislative ReformWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and new laws, regulations and judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations and decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery and payment for healthcare products and services could negatively affect our business, financial condition and prospects. There is significant interest in promoting healthcare reforms, and it is likely that federal and state legislatures within the United States and the governments of other countries will continue to consider changes to existing healthcare legislation.
 For example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs such as:
 •increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;
 •established a branded prescription drug fee that pharmaceutical manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs must pay to the federal government;
 •expanded the list of covered entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program;
 •established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70%, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;


•extended manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
 •expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
 •created a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including our product candidates, that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
 •established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
 •established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending; and
 •created a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products.
 There remain judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. It is unclear how efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act. It is difficult to predict the future legislative landscape in healthcare and the effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
 In addition, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. If government spending is further reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA, to continue to function at current levels, which may impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve research and development, manufacturing and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any product candidates we may develop. Moreover, any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented, or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broader deficit reduction effort or legislative replacement to the Budget Control Act, could have an adverse impact on our anticipated product revenues.
 Furthermore, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to health epidemics. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future.
