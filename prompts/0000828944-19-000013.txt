Recent Developments
On August 7, 2018, WSFS and Beneficial Bancorp, Inc. (Beneficial) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, (as amended from time to time, the Merger Agreement) pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, among other things, (i) Beneficial will merge with and into WSFS, with WSFS continuing as the surviving corporation (the Merger) and (ii) simultaneously, Beneficial Bank will merge with and into WSFS Bank, with WSFS Bank continuing as the surviving bank (the Bank Merger and, together with the Merger, the Mergers). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, stockholders of Beneficial will receive 0.3013 shares of WSFS common stock and $2.93 in cash for each share of Beneficial common stock. Our stockholders approved the Mergers at a special meeting held on December 12, 2018, and Beneficial's stockholders approved the Mergers at a special meeting held on December 6, 2018. The Mergers, which are subject to customary closing conditions, are expected to close on March 1, 2019.
WSFS POINTS OF DIFFERENTIATION
While all banks offer similar products and services, we believe that WSFS, through its service model, has set itself apart from other banks in our market and the industry in general. In addition, community banks such as WSFS have been able to distinguish themselves from large national or international banks by providing our customers with the service levels, responsiveness and local decision making they prefer. The following factors summarize what we believe are our points of differentiation:
Building Associate Engagement and Customer Advocacy
Our business model is built on a concept called Human Sigma, which we have implemented in our strategy of “Engaged Associates delivering stellar experiences growing Customer Advocates and value for our Owners.” The Human Sigma model, identified by Gallup, Inc., begins with Associates who take ownership of their jobs and therefore perform at a higher level. We invest significantly in recruitment, training, development and talent management as our Associates are the cornerstone of our business model. This strategy motivates Associates and unleashes innovation and productivity to engage our most valuable asset, our Customers, by providing them with stellar experiences. As a result, we build Customer Advocates, or Customers who have developed an emotional attachment to the Bank. Research studies continue to show a direct link between Associate engagement, customer advocacy and a company’s financial performance. Our success with this strategy creates a virtuous cycle, further building an environment of engagement and advocacy.

4

Surveys conducted for us by Gallup, Inc. indicate that:

• | Our Associate Engagement scores consistently rank in the top decile of companies polled. In 2018, our engagement ratio was 23.3:1, which means there were 23.3 engaged Associates for every actively disengaged Associate. This compares to a 2.6:1 ratio in 2003 and currently, a U.S. working population ratio of 2.1:1.


• | 68% of customers surveyed ranked us a “five” out of “five,” strongly agreeing with the statement “WSFS is the perfect bank for me.”

By fostering a culture of engaged and empowered Associates, we believe we have become the employer and bank of choice in our market. In 2018, for the 13th consecutive year, we were named a top workplace in Delaware in The News Journal’s ‘Top Workplaces’ survey of our Associates. We were also named the ‘Top Bank’ in Delaware for the eighth year in a row by the readers of The News Journal, and named a fastest growing company in the Greater Philadelphia region ‘Soaring 76’ for the second year in a row by the Philadelphia Business Journal. 
Community Banking Model
Our size and community banking model play a key role in our success. Our approach to business combines a service-oriented culture with a strong complement of products and services, all aimed at meeting the needs of our retail and business Customers. We believe the essence of being a community bank means that we are:

• | Small enough to offer Customers responsive, personalized service and direct access to decision makers, yet


• | Large enough to provide all the products and services needed by our target market customers.

As the financial services industry has consolidated, many independent banks have been acquired by national companies that have centralized their decision-making authority away from their customers and focused their mass-marketing on a regional or even national customer base. We believe this trend has underserved smaller business owners who have become accustomed to dealing directly with their bank’s senior executives, discouraged retail customers who often experience deteriorating levels of service in branches and other service outlets, and frustrated bank employees who are no longer empowered to provide good and timely service to their customers. 
Through our pending Merger with Beneficial, which we expect to close on March 1, 2019, we will create the largest, premier, locally-headquartered community bank in the Greater Delaware Valley, offering the benefits of local market knowledge and decision-making, a full-service product suite, the balance sheet to compete with larger regional and national banks, and most importantly, an ingrained culture of engaged Associates that bring to life WSFS’ mission of We Stand For Service in our daily delivery of stellar Customer experiences.
WSFS Bank offers:

• | One primary point of contact - each of our relationship managers is responsible for understanding his or her Customers’ needs and bringing together the right resources in the Bank to meet those needs.


• | A customized approach to our Customers - we believe this gives us an advantage over our competitors who are too large or centralized to offer customized products or services.


• | Products and services that our Customers value - this includes a broad array of banking, cash management and trust and wealth management products, as well as a legal lending limit high enough to meet the credit needs of our Customers, especially as they grow.


• | Rapid response and a company that is easy to do business with - our Customers tell us this is an important differentiator from larger, in-market competitors.

Strong Market Demographics
Our markets, which primarily include Delaware and southeastern Pennsylvania, are situated in the middle of the Washington, DC to New York corridor which includes the urban markets of Philadelphia and Baltimore. Delaware benefits from this urban concentration as well as from a unique political, legal, tax and business environment. The following table shows key demographics for our markets compared to the national average. 

(Most recent available statistics) | Delaware | SoutheasternPennsylvania (1) | NationalAverage
Unemployment (For December 2018) (2) (3) | 3.8% | 3.2% | 3.7% 
Median Household Income (2013-2018) (4) | $63,036 | $82,349 | $57,652

(5) | Southeastern Pennsylvania data is for 2010-2017

Balance Sheet Management
We put a great deal of focus on actively managing our balance sheet. This manifests itself in:

• | Prudent capital levels - Maintaining prudent capital levels is key to our operating philosophy. At December 31, 2018, the Company's common equity to assets ratio was 11.32% and its tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.99%. At December 31, 2018 all regulatory capital levels for WSFS Bank were above well-capitalized levels. At December 31, 2018, WSFS Bank’s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.69% and $365.0 million in excess of the 6.5% “well-capitalized” level under the banking agencies’ prompt corrective action framework: the Bank’s Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.69% and $276.6 million in excess of the 8% “well-capitalized” level, the Bank’s total risk-based capital ratio was 13.37%, or $198.9 million above the “well-capitalized” level of 10%, and the Bank's leverage ratio was 10.82%, or $402.4 million above the 5% “well-capitalized” level. 

The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio to net income and total assets, the most comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures, please refer to “Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures included in Item 1” located at the end of this section. 

• | Disciplined lending - We maintain discipline in our lending with a particular focus on portfolio diversification and granularity. Diversification includes limits on loans to one borrower as well as industry and product concentrations. We supplement this portfolio diversification with a disciplined underwriting process and the benefit of knowing our customers. We have also taken a proactive approach to identifying trends in our local economy and have responded to areas of concern.


• | Focus on credit quality - We seek to control credit risk in our investment portfolio and use this portion of our balance sheet primarily to help us manage liquidity and interest rate risk, while providing marginal income and tax relief. Our philosophy and pre-purchase due diligence has allowed us to avoid the significant investment write-downs taken by many of our bank peers during the last economic downturn.


• | Asset/Liability management strategies - We have created an investment portfolio that is consistent with our Board of Directors' approved risk appetite and we believe the portfolio contains minimal risks due to our exclusion of non-Agency (private label) mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and other asset-backed securities. We also believe that our thorough due diligence is effective in mitigating the credit risk associated with municipal securities that we have added. Further, our portfolio is highly liquid given our large amount of Agency MBS.

Disciplined Capital Management
We understand that our capital (or stockholders’ equity) belongs to our stockholders. They have entrusted this capital to us with the expectation that it will earn an appropriate return relative to the risks we take. Mindful of this balance, we prudently, but aggressively, manage our capital.
Strong Performance Expectations and Alignment with Stockholder Priorities
We are focused on high-performing, long-term financial goals. We define “high-performing” as the top quintile of a relevant peer group in return on assets (ROA), return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) and EPS growth. Management incentives are, in large part, based on driving performance in these areas. More details on management incentive plans will be included in the proxy statement for our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.

During 2018, we met or exceeded the goals in our 2016-2018 Strategic Plan. For the year ended December 31, 2018, WSFS reported ROA of 1.92%. Core ROA, which excludes non-core items, was 1.63% for 2018, demonstrating our steady progress toward the goals we set in our three year, 2016-2018 Strategic Plan. Core ROA for 2018 excludes (i) corporate development costs, (ii) securities gains, (iii) unrealized gains on equity investments, (iv) realized gain on sale of equity investment, (v) a recovery related to the settlement of a legal claim, and (vi) a recovery related to an unusual fraud loss. 
Core ROA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of Core ROA to ROA, the most comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measure, please refer to “Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures included in Item 1” located at the end of this section. 
For further information related to the legal settlement, see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Growth
We have achieved success over the long-term in lending and deposit gathering, growing the Wealth Management segment’s client base and growing Cash Connect®’s customer base and services. Our success has been the result of a focused strategy that provides service, responsiveness and careful execution in a consolidating marketplace. We plan to continue to grow by:

• | Developing talented, service-minded Associates: We have successfully recruited Associates with strong ties to, and the passion to serve, their communities to enhance our service in existing markets and to provide a strong start in new communities. We also focus efforts on developing talent and leadership from our current Associate base to better equip those Associates for their jobs and prepare them for leadership roles at WSFS. 


• | Embracing the Human Sigma concept: We are committed to building Associate Engagement and Customer Advocacy as a way to differentiate ourselves and grow our franchise.


• | Building fee income through investment in and growth of our Wealth Management and Cash Connect® segments.


• | Continuing strong growth in commercial lending by:


• | Offering local decision-making by seasoned banking professionals.


• | Executing our community banking model that combines stellar experiences with the banking products and services our business customers demand.


• | Adding seasoned lending professionals that have helped us win customers in our Delaware and southeastern Pennsylvania markets.


• | Continuing to grow deposits by:


• | Offering products through an expanded and updated branch network resulting from our pending Merger with Beneficial, increasing our market presence in Philadelphia and southeastern Pennsylvania.


• | Providing a stellar experience to our Customers.


• | Further expanding our commercial Customer relationships with deposit and cash management products.


• | Finding creative ways to build deposit market share such as targeted marketing programs.


• | Seeking strategic acquisitions. We anticipate completing our Merger with Beneficial on March 1, 2019, thereby further expanding our presence in the southeastern Pennsylvania market. During 2018 and 2017, we focused on optimizing our recent acquisitions in southeastern Pennsylvania and our Wealth Management segment. During 2016, we acquired Penn Liberty Financial Corp. (Penn Liberty) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Penn Liberty Bank, expanding our presence in the southeastern Pennsylvania market. In 2016, we also acquired the assets of Powdermill Financial Solutions, LLC and West Capital Management, Inc., an independent, fee-only wealth management firm. Over the next several years, we expect our growth to continue to be a mix of organic growth and acquisition-related growth, consistent with our long-term strategy.

Innovation
Our organization is committed to product and service innovation as a means to drive growth and to stay ahead of changing customer demands and emerging competition. We are focused on developing and maintaining a strong “culture of innovation” that solicits, captures, prioritizes and executes innovation initiatives, from product creation to process improvements. Cash Connect®, a premier provider of ATM vault cash, smart safe and other cash logistics services in the U.S., serves as an innovation engine driving enhancements such as mobile phone cash withdrawals from WSFS ATMs, and has developed best-in-class cash logistics and reconciliation software. These innovations have created internal efficiencies and valued services for our local banking customers and merchants across the nation. We intend to continue to leverage technology and innovation to grow our business and to successfully execute on our strategy.
In conjunction with the announcement of our pending merger with Beneficial, we announced that we are embarking on a multi-year Delivery Transformation effort focused on melding our physical and digital delivery. Industry and customer behavior trends continue to shift as observed in reduced branch traffic and increased mobile adoption.  As such, we have concluded through substantial internal and external analysis that we need to transform our delivery channels to meet these new expectations. As we embark on our 2019-2021 strategic plan, we will accelerate our transformation by optimizing our physical branch network and making strategic investments in meaningful technology solutions, supported by specialized talent. Those investments will provide our Customers with leading edge products and will elevate our Associates, as they strive to serve in a competitive and compelling way. We will design and integrate solutions to provide personalized experiences to our Customers, while retaining the essence of what makes WSFS great.  Through our Delivery Transformation and our ongoing commitment to Stellar Service, we will continue to lead the community and regional banking industry with regards to service delivery and Customer experience.
Over the past several years, we have formed several strategic alliances which have allowed us to stay at the forefront of emerging technology in our industry. Through these partnerships, we look forward to offering and supporting even more innovative products to the financial services marketplace, continuing our organizational learning in this fast-developing space, and participating in value creation for our stockholders.
Values
Our values address integrity, service, accountability, transparency, honesty, growth and desire to improve. They are the core of our culture, they make us who we are and we live them every day.
At WSFS, we:

• | Do the right thing.


• | Serve others.


• | Are welcoming, open and candid.


• | Grow and improve.

Enterprise Risk Management
Since 2013, we have managed our risks through our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program administered by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and ERM Manager. Our stand-alone ERM department is separate from the lines of business. Formal Risk Appetite Statements have been developed for each major risk category throughout the institution; these Statements are reviewed and approved by the Board annually. Key Risk Indicators (KRI’s) or Risk metrics are continually monitored in relation to risk appetite though a Risk Assessment Summary (RAS) dashboard. Each KRI has an assigned quantitative tolerance level which considers our overall risk appetite, regulatory requirements, the bank’s peer group statistics, best practices, and general industry guidelines. As part of our ERM Program, approximately 130 KRIs are monitored company-wide. In the event that risk levels exceed our defined risk appetite, management action is required.  The CRO, deputy CRO, and/or the ERM manager conduct meetings with management of respective business lines at least three times per year to discuss and gather information for ERM reporting. ERM reporting is provided to the Board of Directors three times per year. From a regulatory perspective, our ERM program is evaluated as part of the regular Safety and Soundness examination by the OCC. 
Results 
Our focus on these points of differentiation has allowed us to grow our core franchise and build value for our stockholders. Since 2014, our commercial loans which exclude loans held for sale have grown from $2.7 billion to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2018, a strong 8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Over the same period, customer deposits have grown from $3.5 billion to $5.4 billion, a 9% CAGR. Since 2008, stockholder value has increased at a far greater rate than our banking peers. An investment of $100 in WSFS stock in 2008 would be worth $262 at December 31, 2018. By comparison, $100 invested in the Nasdaq Bank Index in 2008 would be worth $200 at December 31, 2018.

DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Condensed average balance sheets for each of the last three years and analyses of net interest income and changes in net interest income due to changes in volume and rate are presented in “Results of Operations” included in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
CREDIT EXTENSION ACTIVITIES
Over the past several years we have focused on growing the more profitable, relationship-oriented segments of our loan portfolio. Our current portfolio lending activity is concentrated on small- to mid-sized businesses in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S., primarily in Delaware, southern Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey, as well as in northern Virginia. Since 2014, our total net commercial loans have increased by $1.4 billion, or 51% and accounted for 83% of our net loan portfolio at December 31, 2018. Based on current market conditions, we expect our focus on growing commercial and industrial loans and other relationship-based commercial loans to continue during the remainder of 2019 and beyond.
The following table shows the composition of our loan portfolio at year-end for the last five years:

Commercial Real Estate, Commercial Owner-Occupied, Construction and Commercial Lending 
Pursuant to section 5(c) of the Home Owners’ Loan Act (HOLA), federal savings banks are generally permitted to invest up to 400% of their total regulatory capital in nonresidential real estate loans and up to 20% of their assets in commercial loans, but no more than 10% may be in loans that do not qualify as small business loans. As a federal savings bank that was formerly chartered as a Delaware savings bank, the Bank has certain additional lending authority.
Commercial, commercial owner-occupied, commercial mortgage and construction loans have higher levels of risk than residential mortgage lending. These loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment experience on loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and may be more subject to adverse conditions in the commercial real estate market or in the general economy than residential mortgage loans. The majority of our commercial and commercial real estate loans are concentrated in Delaware and Pennsylvania.
We offer commercial real estate mortgage loans on multi-family properties and on other commercial real estate. Generally, loan-to-value ratios for these loans do not exceed 80% of appraised value at origination.
Our commercial mortgage portfolio was $1.2 billion at December 31, 2018. Generally, this portfolio is diversified by property type, with no type representing more than 33% of the portfolio. The largest type is retail-related (non-mall, neighborhood shopping centers and other retail) with balances of $347.0 million. The average size of a loan in the commercial mortgage portfolio is $0.6 million and only nine loans are greater than $8.0 million, with one loan greater than $12.0 million.
We offer commercial construction loans to developers. In some cases these loans are made as “construction/permanent” loans, which provides for disbursement of loan funds during construction with automatic conversion to mini-permanent loans (one - five years) upon completion of construction. These construction loans are short-term, usually not exceeding two years, with interest rates indexed to our WSFS prime rate, the “Wall Street” prime rate or London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), in most cases, and are adjusted periodically as these indices change. The loan appraisal process includes the same evaluation criteria as required for permanent mortgage loans, but also takes into consideration: completed plans, specifications, comparables and cost estimates. Prior to approval of each loan, these criteria are used as a basis to determine the appraised value of the subject property when completed. Our policy requires that all appraisals be reviewed independently from our commercial business development staff. At origination, the loan-to-value ratios for construction loans generally do not exceed 75%. The initial interest rate on the permanent portion of the financing is determined by the prevailing market rate at the time of conversion to the permanent loan. At December 31, 2018, $486.4 million was committed for construction loans, of which $316.6 million was outstanding. The residential construction and land development (CLD) portfolio represented $133.9 million, or 3%, of total loans and 18% of Tier 1 capital (Tier 1 + ALLL), and the commercial CLD portfolio represented $93.7 million, or 2%, of total loans. These portfolios include $15.2 million of “land hold” loans, which are land loans not currently being developed, at December 31, 2018.
10

Commercial and industrial and owner-occupied commercial loans make up the remainder of our commercial portfolio and include loans for working capital, financing equipment and real estate acquisitions, business expansion and other business purposes. These relationships generally range in amounts of up to $40.0 million with an average loan balance in the portfolio of $0.3 million and terms ranging from less than one year to ten years. The loans generally carry variable interest rates indexed to our WSFS prime rate, “Wall Street” prime rate or LIBOR. At December 31, 2018, our commercial and industrial and owner-occupied commercial loan portfolios were $2.5 billion and represented 52% of our total loan portfolio. These loans are diversified by industry, with no industry representing more than 13% of the portfolio.
Federal law limits the Bank’s extensions of credit to any one borrower to 15% of our unimpaired capital (approximately $112.2 million), and an additional 10% if the additional extensions of credit are secured by readily marketable collateral. Extensions of credit include outstanding loans as well as contractual commitments to advance funds, such as standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2018, no borrower had collective (relationship) total extensions of credit exceeding these legal lending limits. 
Residential Real Estate Lending
Generally, we originate held-for-sale residential first mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 80% and require private mortgage insurance or government guarantee for up to 35% of the mortgage amount for mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80%. On a very limited basis, we have originated or purchased loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80% without a private mortgage insurance requirement or government guarantee. At December 31, 2018, the balance of all such loans was approximately $9.7 million.
Generally, our residential mortgage loans are underwritten and documented in accordance with standard underwriting criteria published by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Federal Housing Agency, Veterans Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other secondary market participants to assure maximum eligibility for subsequent sale in the secondary market. 
To protect the propriety of our liens, we require borrowers to provide title insurance. We also require fire, extended coverage casualty and flood insurance (where applicable) for properties securing residential loans. All properties securing our residential loans are appraised by independent, licensed and certified appraisers and are subject to review in accordance with our standards.
The majority of our adjustable-rate, residential real estate loans have interest rates that adjust yearly after an initial period. The change in rate for the first adjustment date could be higher than the typical limited rate change of two percentage points at each subsequent adjustment date. Adjustments are generally based upon a margin (currently 2.75% for U.S. Treasury index; 2.25% for LIBOR index) over the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity, as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve).
Usually, the maximum rate on these loans is five percent above the initial interest rate. We underwrite adjustable-rate loans under standards consistent with private mortgage insurance and secondary market underwriting criteria. We do not originate adjustable-rate mortgages with payment limitations that could produce negative amortization.
The adjustable-rate mortgage loans in our loan portfolio help mitigate the risk related to our exposure to changes in interest rates. However, there are unquantifiable credit risks resulting from potential increased costs to the borrower as a result of re-pricing adjustable-rate mortgage loans. During periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on adjustable-rate mortgage loans may increase due to the upward adjustment of interest costs to the borrower. Further, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans allow us to increase the sensitivity of our asset base to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that yields on our adjustable-rate mortgages will adjust sufficiently to compensate for increases to our cost of funds during periods of extreme interest rate increases.
The original contractual loan payment period for residential loans is normally 10 to 30 years. Because borrowers may refinance or prepay their loans without penalty, these loans tend to remain outstanding for a substantially shorter period of time. First mortgage loans customarily include “due-on-sale” clauses. This provision gives us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property subject to the mortgage. We enforce due-on-sale clauses through foreclosure and other legal proceedings to the extent available under applicable laws.
In general, loans are sold without recourse except for the repurchase right arising from standard contract provisions covering violation of representations and warranties or, under certain investor contracts, a default by the borrower on the first payment. We also have limited recourse exposure under certain investor contracts in the event a borrower prepays a loan in total within a specified period after sale, typically 120 days. The recourse is limited to a pro rata portion of the premium paid by the investor for that loan, less any prepayment penalty collectible from the borrower. There were no repurchases in 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Consumer Lending 
Our primary consumer credit products (excluding first mortgage loans) are home equity lines of credit and equity-secured installment loans. At December 31, 2018, home equity lines of credit outstanding totaled $287.7 million and equity-secured installment loans totaled $231.9 million. In total, these product lines represented 76% of total consumer loans. Typically, maximum loan to value (LTV) limits are 89% for primary residences and 75% for all other properties. At December 31, 2018, we had $595.2 million in total commitments for home equity lines of credit. Home equity lines of credit offer customers the convenience of checkbook and debit card access, and revolving credit features for a portion of the life of the loan and typically are more attractive in a low interest rate environment. Home equity lines of credit expose us to the risk that falling collateral values may leave us inadequately secured. This credit risk is mitigated as the loans amortize over time. Additionally, during 2018 we purchased certain second-lien home equity installment loans through our partnership with Spring EQ, LLC (Spring EQ). These select loans meet or exceed our current underwriting standards and are similar to home equity loans originated through our branch network. Further, during 2018, we grew student loans through our partnership with LendKey Technologies Inc. (LendKey). These loans are primarily to consolidate existing student debt and are also underwritten in accordance with our current credit standards. 
The following table shows the composition of our consumer loan portfolio at year-end for the last five years:

 | At December 31,

(Dollars in thousands) | Amount | | Percent | | Amount | | Percent | | Amount | | Percent | | Amount | Percent | | Amount | Percent

Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales
We engage in traditional lending activities primarily in Delaware, southeastern Pennsylvania, and contiguous areas of neighboring states. As a federal savings bank, however, we may originate, purchase and sell loans throughout the U.S. We purchase loans from outside our traditional lending area through our relationships with Spring EQ and LendKey, when such purchases are deemed appropriate. We originate fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential real estate loans through our banking offices and WSFS Mortgage, our mortgage banking company.
Commercial: We originate commercial real estate and commercial loans through our commercial lending division and Small Business Administration (SBA) loan program. Commercial loans are made for working capital, financing equipment acquisitions, business expansion and other business purposes. During 2018 we originated $1.4 billion of commercial and commercial real estate loan exposures compared to $1.2 billion in 2017. To reduce our exposure on certain types of these loans, and/or to maintain relationships within internal lending limits, at times we will sell a portion of our commercial loan portfolio, typically through loan participations. Commercial loan sales totaled $29.4 million and $33.3 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts represent gross contract amounts and do not necessarily reflect amounts outstanding on those loans. We also periodically buy loan participations from other banks. Commercial loan participation purchases totaled $53.1 million and $19.3 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Any significant modification or additional exposure to one borrowing relationship exceeding $3.5 million must be approved by the Loan Committee. The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the minutes of the Loan Committee meetings. The Executive Committee also approves new credit exposures exceeding $10.0 million and new credit exposures in excess of $5.0 million for customers with higher risk profiles or larger existing relationship exposures. Depending upon their experience and management position, individual officers of the Bank have the authority to approve smaller loan amounts. Our credit policy includes a “House Limit” to any one borrowing relationship, which increased to $40 million in August 2017 from $30 million consistent with overall growth in capital and the size of our loan portfolio. In rare circumstances, we will approve exceptions to the “House Limit.” Our policy allows for only 15 such relationships with an aggregate exposure of 10% of Tier I Capital plus ALLL. At December 31, 2018, no relationships exceeded the $40.0 million “House Limit.” After the close of our pending merger with Beneficial, we expect these limits to increase, reflective of the risk profile of the combined organization. 
12

Residential and Consumer: During 2018, we originated $325.1 million of residential real estate loans, compared with $353.7 million in 2017. From time to time, we have purchased whole loans and loan participations in accordance with our ongoing asset and liability management objectives. There were no such purchases in 2018 or 2017. We sell most newly originated mortgage loans in the secondary market as a means of generating fee income to control the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet and to manage overall balance sheet mix. Residential real estate loan sales totaled $300.6 million in 2018 and $346.1 million in 2017. We hold certain fixed-rate mortgage loans for investment, consistent with our current asset/liability management strategies and our relationship-based lending philosophy.
At December 31, 2018, we serviced $98.6 million of residential first mortgage loans and reverse mortgage loans for others, compared to $102.5 million at December 31, 2017. We also serviced residential first mortgage loans and reverse mortgage loans for our own portfolio totaling $218.1 million and $253.3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively.
Our consumer lending activity is conducted primarily through our branch offices and referrals from other parts of our business. We originate a variety of consumer credit products including home improvement loans, home equity lines of credit, automobile loans, unsecured lines of credit and other secured and unsecured personal installment loans.
We offer government-insured reverse mortgages to our customers. These loans do not close in our name and we process them as a reverse mortgage broker. During 2018 and 2017 we originated $3.4 million and 3.1 million in reverse mortgages, respectively.
Fee Income from Lending Activities
We earn fee income from lending activities, including fees for originating loans, servicing loans and selling loans and loan participations. We also receive fee income for making commitments to originate construction, residential and commercial real estate loans. Additionally, we collect fees related to existing loans which include prepayment charges, late charges, assumption fees and interest rate swap fees. As part of the loan application process, the borrower also may pay us for out-of-pocket costs to review the application, whether or not the loan is closed.
Most loan fees are not recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income immediately, but are deferred as adjustments to yield in accordance with GAAP, and are reflected in interest income over the expected life of the loan. Those fees represented interest income of $5.5 million, $5.1 million and $4.2 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. Loan fee income was mainly due to fee accretion on new and existing loans (including the acceleration of the accretion on loans that paid early), loan growth and prepayment penalties. The increase in loan fee income was concentrated in commercial and industrial and construction loans due to the associated growth in these portfolio categories.
LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE, PROBLEM ASSETS AND DELINQUENCIES
Our results of operations can be negatively impacted by nonperforming assets, which include nonaccruing loans, other real estate owned and restructured loans. Nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if, in our opinion, collection is doubtful, or when principal or interest is past due 90 days and collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest payments. Interest accrued, but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, is reversed and charged against interest income. In addition, the accretion of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on our assessment of the ultimate collectability of principal and interest.
We manage our portfolio to identify problem loans as promptly as possible and take immediate actions to minimize losses. To accomplish this, our Loan Administration and Risk Management Department monitors the asset quality of our loans and investments in real estate portfolios and reports such information to the Credit Policy, Audit and Executive Committees of the Board of Directors and the Bank’s Controller’s Department.

SOURCES OF FUNDS
We manage our liquidity risk and funding needs through our Treasury function and our Asset/Liability Committee. As a result of increased deposit growth, our loan-to-total customer funding ratio at December 31, 2018 was 90%(1), better than our 2018 strategic plan goal of 100%. We have significant experience managing our funding needs through both borrowings and deposit growth.
As a financial institution, we and the Bank have access to several sources of funding. Among these are:

• | Retained earnings


• | Commercial and retail deposit programs


• | Loan repayments


• | Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) borrowings


• | Repurchase agreements


• | Federal Discount Window access


• | Brokered deposits


• | Senior debt

Our branch strategy has been focused on expanding our market penetration and retail footprint in Delaware and southeastern Pennsylvania and attracting new customers in part to provide additional deposit growth. During 2018, CDs increased $43.9 million, or 7%, consistent with our strategy to attract longer-term, fixed-rate funding in a rising-rate environment. Core customer deposit growth (customer deposits excluding CDs) was $380.5 million during 2018, a 9% increase over 2017. 
(1) For this calculation, “loans” includes Loans, held for sale as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
Deposits
WSFS Bank is also the largest locally-managed bank and trust company headquartered in Delaware and the Delaware Valley. The Bank primarily attracts deposits through its retail branch offices and loan production offices, in Delaware and nearby southeastern Pennsylvania.
The Bank offers various deposit products to our customers, including savings accounts, demand deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit. In addition, the Bank accepts “jumbo” certificates of deposit with balances in excess of $100,000 from individuals, businesses and municipalities.
The following table shows the maturities of certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2018:

Less than 3 months | $ | 65,757 
Over 3 months to 6 months | 17,305 | 
Over 6 months to 12 months | 140,736 | 
Over 12 months | 102,195 | 
Total | $ | 325,993

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances
As a member of the FHLB, we are able to obtain FHLB advances. At December 31, 2018, we had $328.5 million in FHLB advances with a weighted average rate of 2.52%, compared with $710.0 million with a weighted average rate of 1.51% at December 31, 2017. Outstanding advances from the FHLB had rates ranging from 1.50% to 2.79% at December 31, 2018. Pursuant to collateral agreements with the FHLB, the advances are secured by qualifying first mortgage loans, qualifying fixed-income securities, FHLB stock and an interest-bearing demand deposit account with the FHLB. As a member of the FHLB, we are required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB in an amount at least equal to 0.10% of our member asset value plus 4.00% of advances outstanding. As of December 31, 2018, our FHLB stock investment totaled $19.3 million, compared with $31.3 million at December 31, 2017.
We received $1.5 million in dividends from the FHLB during 2018, compared to $1.6 million in 2017. For additional information regarding FHLB stock, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Trust Preferred Borrowings
In 2005, the Trust issued $67.0 million aggregate principal amount of Pooled Floating Rate Securities at a variable interest rate of 177 basis points over the three-month LIBOR rate. These securities are callable and have a maturity date of June 1, 2035.
Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
During 2018 and 2017, we purchased federal funds as a short-term funding source. At December 31, 2018, we had purchased $158.0 million in federal funds at an average rate of 2.52%, compared to $28.0 million at an average rate of 1.54% at December 31, 2017. As December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no securities under agreements to repurchase as a funding source.
Senior Debt
On September 1, 2017, we redeemed $55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.25% senior notes due 2019 which were issued in 2012 (the 2012 senior notes). The 2012 senior notes were redeemed using a portion of the proceeds from our 2016 issuance of senior unsecured fixed-to-floating rate notes (the 2016 senior notes) described below. We recorded noninterest expense of $0.7 million due to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs in connection with this redemption. 
On June 13, 2016, we issued $100.0 million of the 2016 senior notes. The 2016 senior notes mature on June 15, 2026 and have a fixed coupon rate of 4.50% from issuance to but excluding June 15, 2021 and a variable coupon rate of three month LIBOR plus 3.30% from June 15, 2021 until maturity. The 2016 senior notes may be redeemed beginning on June 15, 2021 at 100% of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest. The proceeds remaining after the redemption of the 2012 notes are being used for general corporate purposes.
PERSONNEL
At December 31, 2018, we had 1,177 full-time equivalent Associates (employees). Our Associates are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe our relationship with our Associates is very good, as evidenced by the results of our 2018 Associate engagement survey conducted by the Gallup organization which placed us among the top 5% of Gallup clients worldwide for the second year in a row. In addition, we were named a top workplace in Delaware for the 13th consecutive year in The News Journal’s ‘Top Workplaces’ survey of our Associates and a ‘Top Workplace’ in the greater Philadelphia market by philly.com for the fourth consecutive year. We were also honored to receive the Gallup ‘Great Workplace’ award for the third year in a row.

REGULATION
Overview
The Company and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state banking laws, regulations, and policies that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors. The Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the banking system as a whole, are not for the protection of our other creditors and stockholders. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is the Bank’s primary regulator and the Federal Reserve is the Company’s primary regulator.
The statutes enforced by, and regulations and policies of, these agencies affect most aspects of our business, including prescribing permissible types of activities and investments, the amount of required capital and reserves, requirements for branch offices, the permissible scope of our activities and various other requirements.
The Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC to the fullest extent allowed by law. As an insurer of bank deposits, the FDIC promulgates regulations, conducts examinations, requires the filing of reports and generally supervises the operations of all institutions to which it provides deposit insurance.
Financial Reform Legislation
The Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in 2010, imposed new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions and their holding companies, including insured depository institutions. The law also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as an independent agency within the Federal Reserve. Some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have increased our expenses, decreased our revenues, and changed the activities in which we engage. 
In May 2018, the Economic Growth Act was signed into law. The Economic Growth Act amends portions of the Dodd-Frank in order to provide regulatory relief to banking organizations such as ourselves. However, several but not all of the reforms are limited to banking organizations with fewer than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. At December 31, 2018, we were below this ceiling. After our pending merger with Beneficial, which we expect to close on March 1, 2019, our total consolidated assets at both the Company and Bank levels will exceed $10 billion, and we will cease to be eligible for many of these changes. Specific reforms that may affect us include: 

• | Capital requirements - Bank holding companies, such as the Company, with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets may be exempt from the Basel III Capital Rules if they maintain a community bank leverage of ratio of between eight and ten percent. The specific number is to be set by the federal banking agencies. In November 2018, the agencies proposed a CBLR of nine percent. The agencies have not finalized the rule, and we cannot predict when they may do so. For further information, see “Supervision and Regulation - Capital” below. 


• | Volcker Rule - The Volcker Rule, enacted as part of the Economic Growth Act, largely prohibited any banking entity of any size from sponsoring or investing (or retaining an interest in) private equity and hedge funds and from engaging in proprietary trading. Banking entities also were required to establish compliance programs. The Economic Growth Act exempts banks with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or less from the Volcker Rule. This exemption took effect upon enactment. The statute did not formally exempt bank holding companies under the $10 billion threshold from the Volcker Rule, but the federal banking agencies have pledged not to enforce it against these companies. Although we do not believe we engaged in any activities covered by the Volcker Rule, the exemption eliminates any need for a compliance program. 


• | Commercial real estate loans - The Basel III Capital Rules as finalized in 2013 required a banking organization to risk weight certain commercial real estate loans that were determined to have high volatility at 150% rather than at 100% for other commercial real estate (CRE)loans. In order to avoid high volatility commercial real estate (“HVCRE”) status and the higher risk weight, a CRE loan had to meet several requirements, including an equity contribution form the borrower in the form of cash, unencumbered readily marketable assets, or paid development expenses out of pocket. A lender could not return the contribution to the borrower until the loan was paid off or replaced with permanent financing. The Economic Growth Act replaced the HVCRE category with a narrower category for HVCRE acquisition, development, and construction (HVCRE ADC) loans. Among other things, a borrower may now make its equity contribution in the form or real property or improvements, and the lender may reclassify an HVCRE ADC loan more easily, enabling the lender to return the equity contribution to the borrower more easily. The federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule in September 2018 to implement these changes. We have not yet determined the impact of these changes on our CRE loan portfolio. 


• | Exemption to certain mortgage lending rules - The Economic Growth Act creates a new compliance option for mortgages originated and held by banks and credit unions with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets to be considered qualified mortgages for the purposes of the Ability-to-Repay Rule. In addition, the Economic Growth Act exempts certain insured depositories and credit unions that originate few mortgages from certain Home Mortgage Disclosure Act reporting requirements.

Basel III
In 2013, the Federal banking agencies approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. Under the final rules as of January 2015, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital maintained by the Company and the Bank. The rules included a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, raised the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0%, required a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, and required a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. 
In addition, the capital rules subject a banking organization to certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the organization does not maintain a capital conservation buffer: a ratio of CET1 to total risk-based assets of at least 2.5% on top of the minimum risk-based capital requirements. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016, at 0.625%; in 2018 the buffer was 1.875%; and full 2.5% requirement took effect on January 1, 2019. As a result, as of January 1, 2019, the Company and the Bank must adhere to the following minimum capital ratios to satisfy the Basel III Capital Rule requirements and to avoid the limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers: (i) 4.0% tier 1 leverage ratio; (ii) minimum CET 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0%; (iii) minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iv) minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%.
The final rules also revised the standards for an insured depository institution to be “well-capitalized” under the banking agencies’ prompt corrective action framework, requiring a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0% and total capital ratio of 10.0%, while leaving unchanged the existing 5.0% leverage ratio requirement. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the final rules. Newly issued trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock may no longer be included in Tier 1 capital. However, for depository institution holding companies of less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company, most outstanding trust preferred securities and other non-qualifying securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 are permanently grandfathered to be included in Tier 1 capital (up to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital, excluding non-qualifying capital instruments). At December 31, 2018, we had approximately $67.0 million of trust preferred securities outstanding, all of which are counted as Tier 1 capital.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank met the applicable standards on a fully phased-in basis, and the Bank was “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules.
In 2014, the Federal banking agencies adopted a “liquidity coverage ratio” requirement (LCR) for large internationally active banking organizations, and in 2016, the agencies proposed a “net stable funding ratio” standard (NSFR) for the same group of institutions. The LCR measures an organizations’ ability to meet liquidity demands over a 30-day horizon; the NSFR would test the same capacity over a one-year horizon. Neither requirement applies directly to the Company or the Bank, but the policies embedded in them may inform the work of the examiners as they consider our liquidity.
Debit Card Interchange Fees
The Federal Reserve has issued rules under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, as amended by a section of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the Durbin Amendment, to limit interchange fees that an issuer may receive or charge for an electronic debit card transaction. Under the rules, the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and five basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. In addition, the rules allow for an upward adjustment of no more than one cent to an issuer’s debit card interchange fee if the issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the fraud-prevention standards set out in the rule.
In accordance with the statute, the interchange fee standards do not apply to fees charged by issuers that, together with their affiliates, have assets of less than $10.0 billion on the annual measurement date (December 31), such as the Bank, against debit accounts that they hold. After our pending merger with Beneficial, which we expect to close on March 1, 2019, our total consolidated assets at both the Company and Bank levels will exceed $10 billion on December 31, 2019, and we will become subject to the Durbin Amendment rules in 2020.
London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
In 2017, a committee of private-market derivative participants and their regulators convened by the Federal Reserve, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC), was created to identify an alternative reference interest rate to replace LIBOR. The ARRC announced the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (SOFR), a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative to LIBOR. The Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced its intention to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve announced final plans for the production of SOFR, which resulted in the commencement of its published rates by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in April 2018. The Company has contracts, including loan and derivative contracts, that are currently indexed to LIBOR, and we are currently evaluating risks and potential process changes arising from these developments.

Regulation of the Company
General
The Company is a registered savings and loan holding company and is subject to the regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve conducts regular safety and soundness examinations or inspections of the Company, which result in ratings for risk management, financial condition, and potential impact on subsidiary depository institution(s), a composite rating, and a rating for subsidiary depository institution(s) (referred to collectively as the “RFI/C(D)” rating). The Federal Reserve treats the ratings and the examination reports as highly confidential, and they are not available to the public.
The Company is also a public company subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC. We file electronically with the SEC our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We make available on the investor relations page of our website at www.wsfsbank.com, free of charge, copies of these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after filing or furnishing them to the SEC. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Restrictions on Acquisitions
Federal law generally prohibits a savings and loan holding company, without prior regulatory approval, from acquiring direct or indirect control of all, or substantially all, of the assets of any other savings association or savings and loan holding company, or more than 5% of the voting shares of a savings association or savings and loan holding company. These provisions also prohibit, among other things, any director or officer of a savings and loan holding company, or any individual who owns or controls more than 25% of the voting shares of such holding company, from acquiring control of any savings association that is not a subsidiary of such savings and loan holding company, unless the acquisition is approved by the Federal Reserve.
The Company is a grandfathered unitary thrift holding company, a status that allows us to acquire companies or business lines that engage in a wide range of non-banking activities. Should we lose that status, we will be constrained in our ability to acquire many non-banking companies or business lines. We do not currently own any companies that a non-grandfathered unitary thrift holding company would not be allowed to hold. 
Safe and Sound Banking Practices
Savings and loan holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in activities that represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or constitute violations of laws or regulations. For example, the Federal Reserve opposes any repurchase of common stock or any other regulatory capital instrument if the repurchase would be inconsistent with the savings and loan holding company’s prospective capital needs and continued safe and sound operation. As another example, a savings and loan holding company may not impair its subsidiary savings association’s soundness by causing it to make funds available to non-depository subsidiaries or their customers if the Federal Reserve believes it not prudent for the Company to do so. The Federal Reserve can assess civil money penalties on a party for unsafe and unsound activities conducted on a knowing or reckless basis, if those activities caused more than a minimal loss to an institution or pecuniary gain to the party. The penalties can range up to $25,000 for certain reckless violations and up to $1.0 million for certain knowing violations for each day such a violation continues.
Source of Strength
Confirming a longstanding policy of the Federal Reserve, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Company to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank in the event of financial distress at the Bank. Under this standard, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the holding company would not otherwise be inclined to do so. The Federal Reserve also expects the Company to provide managerial support to the Bank as needed. The Federal Reserve may require a savings and loan holding company to terminate an otherwise lawful activity or divest control of a subsidiary if the activity or subsidiary poses a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of a subsidiary savings association and is inconsistent with sound banking principles.
In addition, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the capital rules for savings and loan holding companies are no less stringent than those that apply to their subsidiary savings associations.
18

Dividends
The principal sources of the Company’s cash are debt issuances and dividends from the Bank, supplemented by dividends from its operating subsidiaries (Cypress, Powdermill, West Capital and Christiana Trust DE). Our earnings and activities are affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. For example, these include limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the holding company and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of earnings available for the period for which the dividend is being paid and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future capital needs and current and prospective financial condition. The policy provides that holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiary. Consistent with this policy, a banking organization should have comprehensive policies on dividend payments that clearly articulate the organization’s objectives and approaches for maintaining a strong capital position and achieving the objectives of the Federal Reserve’s policy statement.
In 2009, the Federal Reserve issued a supervisory letter providing greater clarity to its policy statement on the payment of dividends by holding companies. In this letter, the Federal Reserve stated that when a holding company’s board of directors is considering the payment of dividends, it should consider, among other things, the following factors: (i) overall asset quality, potential need to increase reserves and write down assets, and concentrations of credit; (ii) potential for unanticipated losses and declines in asset values; (iii) implicit and explicit liquidity and credit commitments, including off-balance sheet and contingent liabilities; (iv) quality and level of current and prospective earnings, including earnings capacity under a number of plausible economic scenarios; (v) current and prospective cash flow and liquidity; (vi) ability to serve as an ongoing source of financial and managerial strength to depository institution subsidiaries insured by the FDIC, including the extent of double leverage and the condition of subsidiary depository institutions; (vii) other risks that affect the holding company’s financial condition and are not fully captured in regulatory capital calculations; (viii) level, composition, and quality of capital; and (ix) ability to raise additional equity capital in prevailing market and economic conditions (the Dividend Factors). It is particularly important for a holding company’s board of directors to ensure that the dividend level is prudent relative to the organization’s financial position and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios. In addition, a holding company’s board of directors should strongly consider, after careful analysis of the Dividend Factors, reducing, deferring, or eliminating dividends when the quantity and quality of the holding company’s earnings have declined or the holding company is experiencing other financial problems, or when the macroeconomic outlook for the holding company’s primary profit centers has deteriorated. The Federal Reserve further stated that, as a general matter, a holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce its distributions if: (i) its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (ii) its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (iii) it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Failure to do so could result in a supervisory finding that the holding company is operating in an unsafe and unsound manner.
Additionally, as discussed above, the Federal Reserve possesses enforcement powers over savings and loan holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices, or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the authority to proscribe the payment of dividends by bank and savings and loan holding companies.
Cypress and West Capital
Cypress and West Capital are registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisers Act) and as such are supervised by the SEC. The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Noncompliance with the Investment Advisers Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputation damage.

Regulation of WSFS Bank
General
As a federally chartered savings association the Bank is subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC. The OCC conducts regular safety and soundness examinations of the Bank, which result in ratings for capital, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk and a composite rating (referred to collectively as the “CAMELS” rating). The OCC treats the CAMELS ratings and the examination reports as highly confidential, and they are not available to the public. The lending activities and other investments of the Bank must comply with various federal regulatory requirements. The OCC periodically examines the Bank from the standpoints of information technology, asset management/trust, and compliance with regulatory requirements. The Bank must file reports with the OCC describing its activities and financial condition, including a quarterly “call report” that is publicly available. The FDIC also has the authority to conduct special examinations of the Bank, and the CFPB has back-up enforcement authority over the Bank. The Bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated by the Federal Reserve.
Transactions with Affiliates; Tying Arrangements
The Bank is subject to certain restrictions in its dealings with us and our affiliates. Transactions between savings associations and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, with additional limitations found in Section 11 of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. An affiliate of a savings association, generally, is any company or entity which controls or is under common control with the savings association or any subsidiary of the savings association that is commonly controlled by an affiliate or a bank or savings association. In a holding company context, the parent holding company of a savings association (such as the Company) and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the savings association. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B (i) limit the extent to which the savings association or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus, and limit the aggregate of all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus and (ii) require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to the affiliate, purchase of assets from the affiliate, issuance of a guarantee on behalf of the affiliate and several other types of transactions. Extensions of credit to an affiliate usually must be over-collateralized. In addition to the restrictions imposed by Sections 23A and 23B, the Home Owners’ Loan Act also prohibits a savings association from (i) lending or otherwise extending credit to an affiliate that engages in any activity impermissible for bank holding companies, or (ii) purchasing or investing in any stocks, bonds, debentures, notes or similar obligations of any affiliate, except for the purchase of shares of a subsidiary.
Restrictions also apply to extensions of credit by the Bank to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and their related interests and to similar individuals at the Company and the Bank’s affiliates. In general, such extensions of credit (i) may not exceed certain dollar limitations, (ii) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties, and (iii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Certain extensions of credit also require the approval of the Bank’s Board of Directors.
The Bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property, or furnish any service or fix or vary the consideration for them on the condition that (i) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or service from or to the Bank or the Company or their subsidiaries (other than a loan, discount, deposit, or trust service or that are related to and usually provided in connection with any such product or service) or (ii) the customer not obtain some other credit, property, or services from a competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended. The Federal banking agencies have, however, allowed banks and savings associations to offer combined-balance products and otherwise to offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products. The law authorizes the Federal Reserve to grant additional exceptions by regulation or order.
Regulatory Capital Requirements
Under the revised capital regulations based on the BCBS capital guidelines and that took effect on January 1, 2015 for the Bank, savings associations must maintain “tangible” capital equal to 1.5% of average total assets, common equity Tier 1 equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital equal to 6% of risk-weighted assets, total capital (a combination of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) equal to 8% of risk-weighted assets, and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets equal to 4%. The regulations also modified the thresholds necessary for a savings association to be deemed well or adequately capitalized; these adjustments are discussed below under “Prompt Corrective Action.”
20

Under the revised capital rules, the components of common equity Tier 1 capital include common stock instruments (including related surplus), retained earnings, and certain minority interests in the equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries (subject to certain limitations). A savings association must make certain deductions from and adjustments to the sum of these components to determine common equity Tier 1 capital. The required deductions for federal savings associations include, among other items, goodwill (net of associated deferred tax liabilities), certain other intangible assets (net of deferred tax liabilities), certain deferred tax assets, gains on sale in connection with securitization exposures and investments in and extensions of credit to certain subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible for national banks. The adjustments require several complex calculations and include adjustments to the amounts of deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing assets, and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that are includable in common equity Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, and certain minority interests in the equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries not included in common equity Tier 1 capital (subject to certain limitations). Tier 2 capital includes subordinated debt with a minimum original maturity of five years, related surplus, certain minority interests in in the equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries not included in Tier 1 capital (subject to certain limitations), and limited amounts of a bank’s allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL). Certain deductions and adjustments are necessary for both additional Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tangible capital has the same definition as Tier 1 capital.
The revised capital rules also modified the risk weights for several types of assets. The risk weights range from 0% for cash, U.S. government securities, and certain other assets, 50% for qualifying residential mortgage exposures, 100% for corporate exposures and non-qualifying mortgage loans and certain other assets, to 600% for certain equity exposures. Loans that are past due by 90 days or more must be risk-weighted at 150%. Mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from common equity Tier 1 capital in accordance with the adjustment stated above are risk-weighted at 250%.
The capital rules finalized in 2013 applied a risk weight of 150% to “high volatility commercial real estate loans,” commercial real estate CRE loans that failed to meet certain prerequisites. Among them was an equity contribution by a borrower of 15% of a project’s value, in the form of cash or unencumbered readily marketable assets. Additionally, a lender could not reclassify an HVCRE loan and return to the 100% risk weight until the loan was paid off or replaced by permanent financing. The Economic Growth Act revised this risk weight in several ways, limiting the 150% risk weight to “high volatility acquisition, development, and construction” loans. Under the Economic Growth Act requirements, a borrower may make the necessary 15% contribution in the form of equity in the project and may reclassify the loan and risk weight it at 100% before maturity.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with the minimum common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, total capital, tangible capital and leverage capital requirements.
The Company is subject to similar minimum capital requirements as the Bank, except that the Company is not subject to a tangible capital ratio. As of December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the minimum common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, total capital, and leverage capital requirements. For the Company to be “well capitalized,” the Bank must be well-capitalized and the Company must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of December 31, 2018, the Company met all the requirements to be deemed well-capitalized.
Prompt Corrective Action
All banks and savings associations are subject to a “prompt corrective action” regime. This regime is designed primarily to impose increasingly stringent limits on insured depository institutions as their capital deteriorates below certain levels. There are five different capital levels: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. A well-capitalized institution usually is entitled to various regulatory advantages, such as expedited treatment of applications, favorable deposit insurance assessments, and no express restrictions on brokered deposits. The revised capital rules summarized above raised the thresholds for well-capitalized status. In order to be “well capitalized”, an OCC-regulated savings association must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%, a total capital ratio of 10.0%, and a 5.0% leverage ratio, and not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the OCC. An adequately capitalized savings association must maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a leverage ratio of 4.0%. If a savings association falls below any one of these floors, it becomes undercapitalized and subject to a variety of restrictions on its operations.
Although savings and loan holding companies are not subject to prompt corrective action, the Federal Reserve uses the same capital ratios to identify well capitalized holding companies for various purposes.
As of December 31, 2018, the Bank met all of the prerequisites for well-capitalized status.
21

Dividend Restrictions
Both OCC and Federal Reserve regulations govern capital distributions by Federal savings associations to their holding companies. Covered distributions include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the capital account of a savings association to make capital distributions. A savings association must file a notice with the Federal Reserve at least 30 days before making any capital distribution. The association also must file an application with the OCC for approval of a capital distribution if either (1) the total capital distributions for the current calendar year (including the proposed capital distribution) exceed the sum of the institution’s net income for that year to date plus the institution’s retained net income for the preceding two years, (2) the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution, (3) the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or OCC-imposed condition, or (4) the institution is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings. In certain situations, a Federal savings association may be able to file a notice with the OCC rather than an application; in other situations, no application or notice is required for the OCC, although notice to the Federal Reserve still is necessary. During 2018, the Bank paid dividends to the Company after receiving approval from the OCC.
The OCC may prohibit a proposed capital distribution, which would otherwise be permitted by OCC regulations, if the OCC determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.
Under federal law, an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution if the capital distribution would cause the institution to become undercapitalized or if it is already undercapitalized. The FDIC also prohibits an insured depository institution from paying dividends on its capital stock or interest on its capital notes or debentures (if such interest is required to be paid only out of net profits) or distributing any of its capital assets while it remains in default in the payment of any assessment due the FDIC. The Bank is currently not in default in any assessment payment to the FDIC.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts
The Bank’s deposits are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the Deposit Insurance Fund. As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, insured institutions. It also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the FDIC. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings associations, after giving the OCC an opportunity to take such action.
The maximum deposit insurance amount per depositor per insured depository institution per certain types of accounts is $250,000. 
The FDIC has adopted a risk-based premium system that provides for quarterly assessments. In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Deposit Insurance Fund. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2019.
The FDIC has revised its methodology for determining assessments from time to time. The current methodology, which has been in place since the third quarter of 2016, has a range of assessment rates from 3 basis points to 30 basis points on insured deposits. All insured depository institutions with the exception of large and complex banking organizations are assigned to one of three risk categories based on their composite CAMELS ratings. Each of the three risk categories has a range of rates, and the rate for a particular institution is determined based on seven financial ratios and the weighted average of its component CAMELS ratings. The FDIC may adjust assessment rates downward as the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund exceeds 2.0% and higher thresholds. As of September 30, 2018, the reserve ratio was 1.36%. Future changes in insurance premiums could have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations and we cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.
The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including us, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances that would result in termination of our deposit insurance.
Reserves
Pursuant to regulations of the Federal Reserve, a savings association must maintain reserves against its transaction accounts. During 2018, no reserves were required to be maintained on the first $16.0 million of transaction accounts, reserves of 3% were required to be maintained against the next $106.3 million of transaction accounts and a reserve of 10% was required to be maintained against all remaining transaction accounts. These percentages are subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve. Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in a noninterest bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank, the effect of the reserve requirement may reduce the amount of an institution’s interest-earning assets.
22

Consumer Protection Regulations
The Bank’s offerings of retail products and services to consumers are subject to a large number of statutes and regulations designed to protect the finances of consumers and to promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include, but are not limited to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, and their implementing regulations. States may adopt more stringent consumer financial protection statutes that could apply to us as well. The CFPB is responsible for writing and revising the Federal regulations, but the OCC is responsible for ensuring compliance by Federal savings associations with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was subject to OCC oversight, but the CFPB will assume jurisdiction over the Bank as a result of the pending merger with Beneficial, which we expect to close on March 1, 2019. State attorneys general also may file suit to enforce federal and state laws.
The change in leadership at the CFPB in 2017, the release of a new strategic plan and the publication of formal requests for information on possible changes to its general supervisory program and its enforcement program suggest that the CFPB may be taking a different approach to its implementation of consumer financial protection laws than the agency did when it first began operations, but we are unable to predict what effect, if any, these changes may have on the Bank. 
Since its creation in 2011, the CFPB has finalized a number of significant rules, including rules that affect nearly every aspect of the residential mortgage lending and servicing process, from origination through maturity or foreclosure. Among other things, the rules require home mortgage lenders to: (i) develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a “reasonable ability to repay” test and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a “qualified mortgage,” in which case a rebuttable presumption exists that the creditor extending the loan has satisfied the reasonable ability to repay test; (ii) implement new or revised disclosures, policies and procedures for originating and servicing mortgages including, but not limited to, pre-loan counseling, early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower’s principal residence; (iii) comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator hiring and compensation; (iv) comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and certain financial products; and (v) maintain escrow accounts for higher-priced mortgage loans for a longer period of time. 
Privacy and Cybersecurity
Several Federal statutes and regulations require savings associations (as well as banks and other financial institutions) to take several steps to protect nonpublic consumer financial information. The Bank has prepared a privacy policy, which it must disclose to consumers annually. In some cases, the Bank must obtain a consumer's consent before sharing information with an unaffiliated third party, and the Bank must allow a consumer to opt out of the Bank's sharing of information with its affiliates for marketing and certain other purposes. Additional conditions come into play in the Bank's information exchanges with credit reporting agencies. The Bank's privacy practices and the effectiveness of its systems to protect consumer privacy are one of the subjects covered in the OCC's periodic compliance examinations.
The Federal banking agencies pay close attention to the cybersecurity practices of savings associations, banks, and their holding companies and affiliates. The interagency council of the agencies, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, has issued several policy statements and other guidance for banks as new cybersecurity threats arise. FFIEC has recently focused on such matters as compromised customer credentials and business continuity planning. Examinations by the banking agencies now include review of an institution’s information technology and its ability to thwart cyber attacks.
Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering
The Bank Secrecy Act requires federal savings associations and other financial institutions to establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The principal requirements for an insured depository institution include (i) establishment of an anti-money laundering program that includes training and audit components; (ii) establishment of a "know your customer" program involving due diligence to confirm the identity of persons seeking to open accounts and to deny accounts to those persons unable to demonstrate their identities; (iii) the filing of currency transaction reports for deposits and withdrawals of large amounts of cash; (iv) additional precautions for accounts sought and managed for non-U.S. persons; and (v) verification and certification of money laundering risk with respect to private banking and foreign correspondent banking relationships. For many of these tasks a bank must keep records to be made available to its primary federal regulator. Anti- money laundering rules and policies are developed by a bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, but compliance by individual institutions is overseen by its primary federal regulator, in the Bank's case, the OCC.
Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering compliance has been a special focus of the OCC and the other Federal banking agencies in recent years. Any non-compliance is likely to result in an enforcement action, often with substantial monetary penalties and reputation damage. A savings association or bank that is required to strengthen its compliance program often must put on hold any initiatives that require banking agency approval.
23

Community Reinvestment Act
All savings associations and banks are subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which requires each such institution to help meet the credit needs of low- to moderate-income communities and individuals within the institution’s assessment area. CRA does not impose specific lending requirements, and it does not contemplate that a savings association or bank would take any action inconsistent with safety and soundness. The Federal banking agencies evaluate the performance of each of their regulated institutions periodically. Evaluations that result in a conclusion of “Needs to Improve” or “Unsatisfactory” may block or impede regulatory approvals for other actions by an institution.

Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures included in Item 1
We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we provide the following non-GAAP financial measures: core ROA and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio. We believe these measures provide investors with a better understanding of the company’s performance when analyzing changes in our underlying business between reporting periods and provide for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, is a useful financial analysis tool that can assist investors in assessing the company’s operating performance and underlying prospects. This analysis should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
Core ROA is calculated as follows:
 
 | For the year ended
(Dollars in thousands) | December 31, 2018 
Net income (GAAP) | $ | 134,743 | 
Plus: Corporate development expenses (after tax) | 5,632 |

Unrealized gains on equity investment (after tax) | $ | (15,818 | )
Realized gain on sale of equity investment (after tax) | $ | (2,878 | )
Recovery of legal settlement (after tax) | $ | (6,081 | )
Recovery of fraud loss (after tax) | $ | (1,275 | )
Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) | $ | 114,307 | 
Average assets | $ | 7,014,447 | 
ROA (GAAP) | 1.92 | % 
Core ROA (non-GAAP) | 1.63 | % 

The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio is calculated as follows:

(Dollars in thousands) | December 31, 2018
Period End Tangible Assets | 
Period end assets | $ | 7,248,870
Goodwill and intangible assets | (186,023 | )
