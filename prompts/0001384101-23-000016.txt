General
At Veracyte, we believe that exceptional cancer care begins with exceptional diagnostics. We are a global diagnostics company that empowers clinicians with the high-value insights they need to guide and assure patients at pivotal moments in the race to diagnose and treat cancer. Our high-performing tests enable clinicians to make more confident diagnostic, prognostic and treatment decisions, helping patients avoid unnecessary procedures and interventions, and speed time to appropriate treatment, thereby improving outcomes for patients all over the world. 
Our high performing tests are developed using our proven framework of identifying an unmet clinical need, determining the combination of appropriate biomarkers utilizing cutting-edge genomic and other technologies, and then tuning our assays with deep scientific and machine learning capabilities.
We currently offer tests in thyroid cancer (Afirma); prostate cancer (Decipher Prostate); breast cancer (Prosigna); interstitial lung diseases (Envisia); and bladder cancer (Decipher Bladder). Our Percepta Nasal Swab test is being run in our CLIA lab in support of clinical studies and our tests for kidney cancer and lymphoma are in development, the latter as a companion diagnostic.
We serve global markets with two complementary models. In the United States, we offer laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, through our centralized, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, certified laboratories in South San Francisco and San Diego, California, supported by our cytopathology expertise in Austin, Texas. Additionally, primarily outside of the United States, we provide tests to patients through distribution to laboratories and hospitals that can perform the tests locally. Today, this includes our Prosigna test, and in the future, we intend to offer the Envisia, Decipher Prostate and Percepta Nasal Swab tests as in vitro diagnostic, or IVD, tests that run on the nCounter Analysis System. We believe our broad menu of advanced genomic diagnostic tests, combined with our ability to deliver them globally, uniquely positions us in the diagnostics industry. 
In March 2021, we acquired Decipher Biosciences, expanding our genomic testing menu into urologic cancers. The acquisition also provided us with Decipher GRID (Genomics Resource for Intelligent Discovery), a platform and database that helps drive biopharmaceutical partnerships, key opinion leader, or KOL, engagement and pipeline development in urologic cancers. 
In August 2021, we acquired HalioDx SAS and HalioDx Inc., historically a wholly owned subsidiary of HalioDx SAS, (collectively referred to as “HalioDx”), giving us the capabilities and expertise to manufacture our own IVD test kits for use on the nCounter Analysis System. The acquisition also deepened our scientific expertise and capabilities in the rapidly growing area of immuno-oncology further strengthening our offerings to biopharmaceutical and other partners. 
We were incorporated in Delaware as Calderome, Inc. in August 2006. Calderome operated as an incubator until early 2008. We changed our name to Veracyte, Inc. in March 2008. 
Our Proven Framework for Test Development and Commercialization
We have an established framework to develop and commercialize tests to benefit physicians, patients and payers in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancer. 
Our process begins with our comprehensive strategic planning approach which identifies unmet clinical needs in oncology through a broad examination of the clinical care spectrum, in collaboration with our physician customers and KOL partners. Our experienced medical affairs team supports the process by conducting extensive diligence to understand the patient journey – focusing on diagnosis, prognosis and treatment decision-making – to determine where providing physicians with more accurate and comprehensive information can positively enhance care for patients, enabling them to avoid risky, costly procedures and interventions, and accelerate time to appropriate treatment. This assessment includes determining what specific clinical question our test should answer, where it should be positioned in the patient work-up and what sample type and cutting edge genomic technology should be used. This leads to tests designed to integrate easily into current physician protocols, helping to deliver clinical utility and economic value to physicians, payers, and the healthcare system.
We utilize a comprehensive, platform-agnostic, approach to developing our diagnostic tests that leverages innovations in genomic technology, immuno-oncology, and machine learning, and does so, across numerous biological specimen types. Further, our development activities focus on the same type of sample on which it will be used in clinical practice, which are prospectively collected through Institutional Review Board-approved multicenter clinical trials. This enables us to build extensive, robust biorepositories of patient samples and well-curated clinical, radiological, outcome and other information. This rich content feeds into our machine learning algorithms, which we utilize to create tests that answer specific clinical questions. 
We use machine learning algorithms to match biological patterns with “clinical truth,” or the true diagnosis or clinical outcome, which allows us to predict the presence, or absence, of disease or a patient’s prognosis in a clinical setting. For biomarker discovery and product development, we utilize machine learning to select the genomic, clinical or other features from our biorepository that best distinguish the condition we are trying to identify. This provides us with exquisite data to be able to validate our tests with exceptional performance. 
We then drive adoption and access to our tests by cultivating further KOL support and developing robust clinical evidence in an effort to gain reimbursement, and ultimately guideline inclusion. In addition to publishing the results of clinical validation studies, we also publish analytical validation studies to establish the reproducibility of our tests across lab instruments, operators and samples. We engage KOLs and community physicians in studies to build the clinical utility evidence needed to support coverage policies and reimbursement from Medicare and private payers. Additionally, our clinical and medical affairs teams continue to liaise with physicians on user-experience, decision impact and other studies. To date, we estimate that approximately 200 studies demonstrating the performance and clinical utility of our CLIA-based tests have been published in peer-reviewed medical journals.
Our ability to develop rigorous clinical evidence for our tests has enabled their inclusion in leading clinical practice guidelines, including those from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN. Our CLIA model enables us to manage the rollout of our tests and bill payers directly, which facilitates test adoption and helps us work directly with payers to secure payment, as well as coverage policies. We employ a team of in-house claims processing and reimbursement specialists who work with payers, physician practices and patients to optimize reimbursement. We have achieved Medicare reimbursement for all our commercially supported tests. We expect to continue to focus on increasing adoption, coverage, and reimbursement of our tests and to build upon our extensive library of clinical evidence.
Our tests address unmet clinical needs in seven of the 10 most prevalent cancers by U.S. incidence and are sold directly to physicians through our specialized sales teams. Our experienced marketing teams help drive penetration through a range of strategies and tactics, including medical conference participation and events, speaker programs, digital marketing programs, advocacy group engagement and other initiatives. 
By leveraging our internal technology and bioinformatics capabilities across our growing database of highly-curated data for more than 375,000 patient samples, we will have the ability to further drive new product development in existing and future indications and offer unique insights to biopharmaceutical researchers. Our data assets and biorepositories may include RNA, DNA, variant, fusion and other genomic data, immune-response data, and well-curated clinical, radiological, outcome and other information.
Serving the U.S. Market Through Our CLIA Labs 
Our tests are improving patient care in thyroid, prostate, lung, and bladder cancer, as well as in interstitial lung disease. 
Currently all of our tests in the U.S. are serviced through our own CLIA certified laboratories in South San Francisco and San Diego, California, and Austin, Texas. We manage our labs with a focus on operational excellence and continuous improvement. We measure performance using such criteria as lab-processing turnaround time, failure rates and deviation vs. control. We have an active monitoring program to ensure lab operations exceed regulatory requirements. We use a systematic, analytical approach aimed at delivering optimal outcomes for patients and referring physicians, while driving cost and lab-efficiency improvement as we scale operations. 
Our Clinical Diagnostic Tests Offered Through Our CLIA Labs
Thyroid Cancer - Afirma Genomic Sequencing Classifier
Each year in the United States, an estimated 565,000 people undergo fine needle aspiration, or FNA, biopsy evaluation for potentially cancerous thyroid nodules. We estimate that more than 110,000 of these patients receive indeterminate results (not clearly benign or malignant) based on traditional cytopathology evaluation. Historically, most of these patients were referred to diagnostic surgery, even though 70 to 80 percent of the time, the nodules proved to be benign. 
We developed the Afirma Genomic Sequencing Classifier, or GSC, to determine which patients with indeterminate results are actually benign so that these patients may avoid unnecessary, costly surgery that often leads to the need for lifelong daily thyroid hormone replacement drugs. The test was developed with RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing and machine learning technology to provide physicians with clinically actionable results from the same FNA biopsy used for initial cytopathology. 
Strong clinical validation data from a multicenter cohort of prospectively collected patient samples were published in JAMA Surgery. The findings showed that Afirma GSC has a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 68%, meaning that in a patient population with 24% cancer prevalence – which is what would be expected in clinical practice – the test can identify more than two-thirds of benign thyroid nodules, with a negative predictive value, or NPV, of 96%. A meta-analysis of 13 independent studies assessing the test's performance in a real-world clinical setting found a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 88%, and an NPV of 99%, reinforcing Afirma's performance. 
Afirma GSC and its predecessor, the Afirma Gene Expression Classifier, are supported by more than 70 peer-reviewed, published studies. These include the original clinical validation study, which was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Afirma testing is included in leading practice guidelines and is covered for over 275 million Medicare and commercial health plan enrollees in the United States.
Our sales team sells Afirma GSC to endocrinologists and other physicians who perform FNA biopsies on patients with thyroid nodules. We estimate that approximately 70% of our testing volume comes from physicians in hospital or institutional settings and the remaining 30% comes from community-based practices. Physicians can order Afirma GSC testing in one of two ways: by submitting indeterminate FNA samples directly to Veracyte for genomic testing or by submitting FNA samples for initial cytopathology analysis by our partner, Thyroid Cytopathology Partners, with genomic testing performed by Veracyte when the cytopathology is indeterminate. 
Prostate Cancer - Decipher Prostate Biopsy and Radical Prostatectomy, or RP, Genomic Classifiers
An estimated 288,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year in the United States. Prior to the utilization of genomics, clinicians relied solely on clinical parameters, such as prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, level and pathology to determine the appropriate treatment for each patient. But those factors alone do not always reflect the true biology of the tumor, which often leads to over- and under-treatment of patients with localized prostate cancer. The Decipher Prostate Genomic Classifier test results dramatically improve the physician's ability to personalize therapy for each patient and make more appropriate treatment decisions. 
The Decipher Prostate cancer tests, developed through whole-transcriptome analysis and machine learning, are used across localized disease to predict a patient’s risk of progressing to metastatic disease within five years, which helps physicians determine an appropriate treatment plan. The Decipher Prostate Biopsy test is performed on a prostate biopsy sample following a cancer diagnosis to inform whether the patient is a candidate for active surveillance, needs monotherapy or may benefit from multi-modal or intensified therapy. The Decipher Prostate RP test is performed on surgical tissue to guide decision-making regarding treatment timing following radical prostatectomy and to help determine whether patients undergoing salvage radiotherapy may benefit from the addition of hormone therapy or may safely avoid hormone therapy and its side effects. 
The Decipher Prostate Genomic Classifier is currently being investigated in seven National Cancer Institute-sponsored, phase 3, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trials; 24 phase 2/3 prospective trials; and more than 20 retrospective studies of phase 3 randomized controlled trials. Many of these trials require Decipher Prostate testing for study inclusion. The test’s performance and utility has been evaluated in approximately 70 peer-reviewed, published studies. 
The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology, or NCCN Guidelines, for Prostate Cancer (v1.2023) includes a new table (Table 1) in Principles of Risk Stratification summarizing the characteristics of different tools used for initial risk stratification of clinically localized prostate cancer. In this table, Decipher Prostate is the only gene expression test with the highest level of evidence (Level 1) for validation. The NCCN Guidelines also uniquely suggest use of the Decipher Prostate RP test to inform treatment recommendations, post surgery, based on the patient’s Decipher score. Decipher Prostate is covered by Medicare and commercial payers representing approximately 195 million enrollees.
Lung Cancer - Percepta Nasal Swab Test 
Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate of all cancers worldwide, causing approximately 1.8 million deaths each year. Lung nodules are typically the first sign of lung cancer and cannot be ignored – however, most of them are benign. Physicians currently have limited objective tools to help accurately determine which patients with lung nodules found on CT scans have cancer. Approximately 15 million patients are now recommended for annual lung cancer CT screening to detect potentially cancerous lung nodules early. Today, approximately 1 million Americans are screened annually for lung cancer, and about 1.6 million lung nodules are found incidentally. We developed the Percepta Nasal Swab test to help physicians more accurately, quickly and confidently identify lung cancer risk so that patients whose lung nodules are benign may avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and patients whose nodules are likely cancerous may proceed to further diagnostic work-up and, if necessary, treatment. 
The Percepta Nasal Swab test is built upon foundational "field of injury" science - through which genomic changes associated with lung cancer in current and former smokers to detect smoking-related damage associated with lung cancer in current or former smokers, but uses a sample collected non-invasively from the nasal passage. Veracyte developed the final classifier using RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing and machine learning on a training set of nasal samples from more than 1,100 patients representing a wide range of lung and tumor biology.
In clinical validation data presented at the 2021 American College of Chest Physicians, or CHEST, Annual Meeting, when the Percepta Nasal Swab test identified patients as low risk, its sensitivity was 97%, providing a negative predictive value, or NPV, of 98% in a population with the 25% cancer prevalence that would be expected in a broad cohort with suspicious lung nodules. This NPV would assist physicians in avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures in these patients with a very small likelihood of missing a cancer. When the test identified patients as high risk, its specificity was 92%, for a positive predictive value, or PPV, of 70% at a malignancy rate of 25%. Given these data, we believe the Percepta Nasal Swab test would assist physicians in directing these patients to further procedures so they could obtain an accurate diagnosis and speed time to treatment, if necessary. Patients in the moderate risk group could be managed according to current clinical guidelines. We are running the Percepta Nasal Swab test in our CLIA lab in support of our clinical utility study, in an effort to demonstrate data to help drive Medicare and private payer coverage, as well as clinical adoption. 
ILD/IPF - Envisia Genomic Classifier
Each year in the United States approximately 200,000 patients are suspected of having an interstitial lung disease, or ILD, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, which is among the most common and deadly of these lung-scarring diseases. Obtaining an accurate, timely IPF diagnosis is important given the availability of drugs that can slow the progression of this debilitating disease, as well as the need to avoid inappropriate and potentially harmful treatment. Additionally, prognostic information may help physicians determine treatment plans for patients with ILDs, including IPF.
Limitations in current technologies make IPF notoriously difficult to diagnose, often leading to treatment delays, repeated misdiagnoses, patient distress and added healthcare expenses. Physicians routinely use high-resolution computed tomography, or HRCT, imaging to identify usual interstitial pneumonia, or UIP, the pattern whose presence is essential to IPF diagnosis. This approach, however, frequently provides inconclusive results, with current guidelines recommending consideration of 
surgery to secure a more definitive diagnosis. Such surgeries are risky and expensive, and many patients are too frail to undergo the procedure. 
The Envisia classifier is the first test of its kind for improving the diagnosis of ILDs, including IPF, without the need for surgery. The test identifies usual interstitial pneumonia, or UIP, a pattern that is essential to the diagnosis of IPF, with high accuracy on patient samples that are obtained through transbronchial biopsy, a nonsurgical procedure that is commonly used in lung evaluation. 
The Envisia classifier is supported by clinical data published in eight peer-reviewed journals, including The Lancet Respiratory Medicine and American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. In 2022, an updated global (ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT) clinical practice guideline highlighted the role of the Envisia Classifier in the diagnosis of IPF with more than 40% of the guideline authors voting to recommend Envisia testing. The guideline points to a newly published meta-analysis in AnnalsATS demonstrating consistently high specificity of 92% across 4 separate studies. 
We obtained Medicare coverage for the Envisia classifier through the Molecular Diagnostics Services Program, or MolDX, program in 2019. We estimate that half of the patients evaluated for ILDs/IPF in the United States are covered by Medicare. 
Bladder Cancer - Decipher Bladder Genomic Classifier
Each year in the U.S., nearly 85,000 people are expected to be diagnosed with bladder cancer. Patients diagnosed with non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer, or MIBC, often undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or NAC, prior to standard-of-care radical cystectomy, even though the absolute survival benefit associated with the addition of NAC to radical cystectomy is just 5-10%. Until recently, there was no reliable way to determine which MIBC tumors would – or would not – respond to chemotherapy. 
Decipher Bladder is a genomic test that measures the molecular profile of bladder cancer using gene expression analysis from transurethral resected bladder tumor specimens. The test was developed for use in bladder cancer patients with high-grade non-muscle-invasive disease who are being considered for treatment and patients with muscle-invasive disease who face the question of immediate cystectomy or systemic treatment in the neoadjuvant setting prior to cystectomy. Decipher Bladder reports the molecular subtype of the tumor specimen as Luminal or Non-Luminal (Luminal Infiltrated, Basal, Basal Claudin-Low or Neuroendocrine-like), with each subtype having distinct biological composition, clinical behavior and predicted benefit from NAC and may have implications for future therapeutic strategies.
The Decipher Bladder test is supported by multiple peer-reviewed clinical studies demonstrating its ability to identify which patients have a higher risk of upstaging to non-organ confined disease at surgery and which patients may benefit the most from neoadjuvant therapy. 
We began commercialization of the Decipher Bladder test in the fall of 2021, following final Medicare coverage for the test in July 2021. The Decipher Bladder test is the first genomic test to be covered by Medicare for patients with bladder cancer. 
Driving Global Growth with Distributed IVD Tests 
Once we have developed robust clinical evidence and physician adoption of our tests in the United States, we typically then drive further patient access by launching them, as appropriate, into global markets as IVD tests that are run on the nCounter Analysis System. This approach enables our tests to be performed locally in laboratories and hospitals worldwide, which we believe facilitates market access and physician adoption in Europe and other strategic global markets. 
In December 2019, we acquired the exclusive worldwide license to the nCounter Analysis System for clinical IVD test use, development and commercialization. We expect this instrument platform to enable a broad range of testing through its ability to simultaneously conduct multiplex evaluation of up to 800 RNA and other targets. 
We currently offer IVD testing in breast cancer and, looking forward, we believe we are well positioned to develop and deliver a menu of tests for use on the nCounter Analysis System. Our acquisition of HalioDx in August 2021 provides us with a European headquarters to develop, manufacture and supply our own IVD test kits. We plan to transition manufacturing of our tests, currently produced by NanoString in the U.S., to our facility in France, giving us end-to-end control of our IVD test supply chain. We anticipate the vertical integration of research, development and manufacturing will enhance our ability to efficiently serve the global market with a broad menu of diagnostic tests. 
Breast Cancer - Prosigna Breast Cancer Assay
Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide. In 2020, there were an estimated 2.3 million new cases of the disease. Hormone receptor positive breast cancer is the most prevalent type of breast cancer, comprising approximately 70% of cases. Of these, we estimate that the global early-stage breast cancer recurrence market is significant, with approximately 750,000 patients potentially eligible for the Prosigna Breast Cancer Assay 
annually. This is comprised of approximately 280,000 patients in the United States and 270,000 across the major markets in Europe. 
Information about individual patients’ prognosis is the foundation of treatment decision-making and recommendations in breast cancer. However, traditional non-molecular tests are often insufficient to reliably determine patients’ individual risk of recurrence and, therefore, adequately inform therapy decisions. 
The Prosigna Breast Cancer Assay is a clinically validated prognostic assay that uses advanced genomic technology and combines clinical and pathological information to help inform next steps for post-menopausal women with early-stage, hormone receptor positive breast cancer, helping them avoid unnecessary toxic chemotherapy or under-treatment. The assay is performed in laboratories in EMEA, as well as the U.S. and other selected countries. The Prosigna Breast Cancer Assay analyzes the activity of 46 genes in the PAM50 gene signature, and based on molecular subtypes, proliferation score, and clinical-pathological features, can provide a hormone-receptor positive, early-stage breast cancer patient and their physician with a prognostic risk-of-recurrence score that indicates the probability of cancer recurrence over the next ten years.
The Prosigna assay is clinically validated in studies published in Annals of Oncology and the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Medicare coverage for Prosigna has been in effect since 2015. The test is recommended in guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Society of Clinical Oncology in the United States. Outside of the United States, the test is included in leading medical guidelines, including from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom and the European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO.
The Prosigna assay utilizes formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue and is offered as an IVD test that runs on the nCounter Analysis System. The test has been CE-IVD marked, showing that it conforms with European Union regulations, and is available for use by healthcare professionals in the European Union and other countries that recognize the CE mark, as well as in Canada, Israel, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. The Prosigna test is FDA 510(k) cleared in the United States for use on the nCounter Analysis System.
The Prosigna Breast Cancer Assay is sold to laboratories by our direct sales team, who also lead efforts to gain support among KOLs in breast cancer oncology. 
Biopharmaceutical and Other Revenue
We have formed numerous biopharmaceutical partnerships that derive value out of our current assets or future ones. Through development and commercialization of our tests, we have built or gained access to unique biorepositories that include extensive clinical cohorts and whole-genome RNA sequencing and other data, such as immuno-oncology.
Biopharmaceutical customers may be interested in leveraging our data to: first, understand or confirm a drug’s method of action by looking at patients’ gene expression profiles or tumor microenvironment pre- and post-treatment; second, identify predictive or prognostic biomarkers for drug response, toxicity or disease progression, which define the ideal patient subpopulation for a given therapy; and/or lastly, identify patient populations with rare genetic variations for clinical trials or existing therapies. We also offer customized biomarker testing and analytical services to our biopharmaceutical partners, helping them advance their goals. 
Through the acquisition of HalioDx in 2021, we bolstered our offering to these customers by gaining expertise in immuno-oncology. Our immuno-oncology offerings to biopharmaceutical partners focus on the implications of the tumor microenvironment using tools such as Immunoscore IC, Immunosign, our Brightplex innovative technology, and our Veracyte Biopharma Atlas dedicated database. Immunogram, our multi-modal platform, provides a comprehensive understanding of the tumor immune microenvironment by seamlessly integrating data from a variety of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic platforms. We believe our immuno-oncology capabilities and offerings are complementary to – and in the future may be more integrated into – our core genomic diagnostics business.
Additionally, we deploy our know-how in IVD test development to develop and manufacture such tests for other diagnostic companies in indications that are noncompetitive to Veracyte. 
COVID-19 and Macroeconomic Factors
We believe the COVID-19 outbreak, including its numerous variants, impacted our total test volumes primarily during 2020 and 2021. Our customers, third-party contract manufacturers, carriers, suppliers and collaboration partners have been affected by the closure of hospitals, doctors' offices, manufacturing sites, or country borders, among other measures put in place around the world. Layoffs, furloughs and unplanned loss of staff in the medical industry and otherwise during the pandemic have had, and will continue to have, negative impacts on the demand for and supply of medical care and diagnostic tests, which affects the frequency with which tests are ordered, and the ability of doctors and hospitals to administer such tests. Further the inability to travel and conduct face-to-face meetings can also make it more difficult to expand utilization of our products into new geographies and to drive awareness of our products. 
Our Decipher Prostate test has been least impacted by the pandemic because our customers are mostly community-based urology practices, which generally remained more accessible to patients and our sales reps. Our Afirma thyroid cancer test was impacted by COVID-19 in 2020 and portions of 2021 as a majority of our samples come from large institutions which are less accessible to patients and our reps. We believe our pulmonology business was the most impacted since the bronchoscopy procedures used to collect samples for our Envisia test are considered elective procedures and are performed in hospital settings, which have been more restrictive. Further, these tests are ordered by pulmonologists who could be largely preoccupied with caring for COVID-19 patients. 
In addition, ongoing interest rate increases and inflation in the U.S. and other markets globally may heighten the risk of an economic downturn or recession and volatility and dislocation in the capital or credit markets in the U.S. or globally. Moreover, the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies (including the Euro, in which a material portion of our European sales and costs are denominated), has impacted and may continue to impact our results of operations. We intend to continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions closely and may determine to take certain financial or operational actions in response to such conditions as appropriate. Finally, the measures taken by Russia in response to European support for Ukraine have increased the risk of disruptions to energy supplies in Europe, which may impact our ability to manufacture tests from our facility in Marseille, France.
The extent of the impact of COVID-19 and other macroeconomic factors on our future liquidity and operational performance will depend on certain developments, including the deployment and long-term efficacy of vaccines; the duration and spread of the outbreak particularly in the form of more transmissible variants; the impact on our customers' operations; the impact to our sales and renewal cycles; changes in central bank policies and interest rates; rates of inflation; and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. See Risk Factors for further discussion. 
Reimbursement
United States
Revenue from our tests comes from several sources, including commercial third-party payers, such as insurance companies and health maintenance organizations, government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and patients.
Medicare generally covers molecular diagnostic tests through the individual Medicare Administrative Contracts, or MACs. Medicare coverage for most of Veracyte’s tests is determined through the MolDX program, administered by the MAC Palmetto GBA. Through Local Coverage Determinations, or LCDs, and associated coverage articles, MolDX covers Afirma GSC, Envisia, Decipher Prostate, Decipher Bladder, and Prosigna. For testing services that do not fall within the scope of the MolDX program, coverage may be adjudicated by the MAC with jurisdiction over the laboratory that performs the test, either via an LCD or on a claim-by-claim basis.
Since 1984, Medicare has paid for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests, or CDLTs, on the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, under section 1833(h) of the Social Security Act, or the SSA. Section 216(a) of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, made extensive revisions to the Medicare CLFS coding, rate setting processes, and laboratory payment reporting for CDLTs, and created a new subcategory of CDLTs called Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Tests, or ADLTs, with separate reporting and payment requirements.
In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued the final rule to implement the requirements of PAMA, which significantly revised the Medicare payment system for CDLTs. The final rule was implemented on January 1, 2018, for the private payer rate-based fee schedule required by PAMA. Under the final rule, for CDLTs furnished on or after January 1, 2018, the amount Medicare pays is equal to the weighted median of private payer rates for the CDLTs, reported triennially for CDLTs, and annually for ADLTs. Congress has extended the first payment cycle under PAMA by an additional three years for CDLTs, moving the next data reporting period under PAMA from 2020 to 2023 for final private payer payments made between January 1 and June 30, 2019, extending the applicability of the payment rates that took effect in 2018 through December 31, 2023. 
We submit claims to payers directly using unique American Medical Association Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes when they exist for our products and services and use either miscellaneous or common CPT codes for non-proprietary testing services or when unique codes do not exist. Third-party payers, including Medicare, have specific and often complex billing rules, failure to abide by which may result in denials, audits, and/or refund requests. We work with commercial payers to establish medical coverage policies for our tests and services, negotiate network status and contracted rates. Payment from third-party payers differs depending on whether we have entered into a contract with the payers as a “contracted provider” or do not have a contract and are considered a “non-contracted provider.” Payers will often reimburse non-contracted providers, if at all, at a lower rate than contracted providers. 
When we contract to serve as a contracted provider, reimbursements are made pursuant to a negotiated fee schedule and are limited to only covered indications. Becoming a contracted provider generally results in higher reimbursement for covered indications and lack of reimbursement for non-covered indications. As a result, the impact of becoming a contracted provider with a specific payer will vary.
In some cases, third party payers may request audits of the amounts paid to us. This may require us to repay certain amounts to payers as a result of such audits.
Factors that impact reimbursement:
•Variability in medical policies indicating coverage for our products and services
•Network status and claims adjudication as in-network or out of network and corresponding patient co-pay/coinsurance responsibilities
•Patient financial assistance programs
•Changes to AMA-CPT coding rules and edits
•Medicare clinical laboratory and physician fee schedules
•Government sequestration 
•Medicaid fee schedules
•Contracted rates for our diagnostics
•Utilization management or prior authorization processes and steps put in place by commercial payers ensuring medical necessity of services ordered for patients
•Billing errors
•Claims disputes
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, revenue was represented by the indicated percent for each payer: 
Medicare accounted for 31%, 30% and 24% of our revenue. Medicaid accounted for 2%, 2%, and 2% of our revenue. Private commercial payers accounted for 52%, 54%, and 61% of our revenue.
Outside the United States
Outside of the United States, we bill hospital and laboratory customers directly for test kits they order. Our customers subsequently bill third-party payers for reimbursement. Prosigna test marketing has initially targeted private and cash-pay markets in Europe. We will continue to drive Prosigna reimbursement efforts in Europe and other global markets through the development of clinical and other evidence to support the test’s inclusion in guidelines and coverage programs. The test is currently reimbursed in Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Lithuania, Switzerland, Canada, England, Scotland, and Israel.
Competition
Our main competition from diagnostic companies or academic institutions are those that use next generation sequencing technology or other methods to measure genomic biomarkers in disease areas addressed by our tests. 
Primary competition in the broader test space comes from traditional methods used by physicians to diagnose and manage patient care decisions. Many of the traditional practices have been the standard of care in the United States for many years, and we need to continue to educate physicians about the benefits of Veracyte’s tests, which have the potential to change clinical practice and improve patient outcomes.
Our Afirma test faces competition from companies and academic institutions that use next generation sequencing technology or other methods to measure mutational markers such as BRAF and KRAS, along with numerous other mutations. These organizations include, for example, Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc., CBLPath, Inc./University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and others who are developing new products or technologies that may compete with our tests. 
Our Decipher Prostate test faces competition from Myriad Genetics and MDxHealth, which offer genomic testing for prognostic purposes within localized prostate cancer. Additionally, traditional methods used by pathologists and clinicians to estimate risk of disease progression pose competitive threats to our business. Companies combining these traditional methods with artificial intelligence could potentially emerge as competitors, but most of these technologies are currently in the research stage. In bladder cancer, we are not currently aware of a direct competitor offering genomic testing for prognostic purposes that match the intended use population for our test. However, DNA mutational analysis, traditional clinical methods and nomograms are currently in use by physicians for similar purposes.
We believe our primary competition in pulmonology with our Envisia classifier will similarly come from traditional methods used by physicians to diagnose the related diseases. For the Percepta Nasal Swab test, we expect competition from companies focused on lung cancer such as Biodesix, Inc. We believe our principal competitor in the breast cancer diagnostics market is Exact Sciences, Inc., which currently commands a substantial majority of the market. Other competitors in the breast cancer diagnostics market include Myriad Genetics, Inc. and Agendia, Inc. 
Increasing acceptance and knowledge of the importance of earlier screening and diagnostic testing linked with improved patient outcomes and therapy selection is leading to more companies developing genomic testing services and technologies. We may also face competition from companies informing treatment decisions such as Guardant Health or Foundation Medicine, Inc. Competition could also emerge from competitors, using alternative samples, such as blood, urine or sputum.
We also face competition from commercial laboratories, such as Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings and Sonic Healthcare USA, with strong infrastructure to support the commercialization of diagnostic services. In addition, competitors may develop their own versions of our solutions in countries we may seek to enter where we do not have patents or where our intellectual property rights are not recognized and compete with us in those countries, including encouraging the use of their solutions by physicians in other countries.
We believe key factors contributing to our success in the market include our scientific and technological excellence, evidence of clinical differentiation, strong KOL support and payer coverage policies for our tests. We believe our strength across these areas form a barrier to entry and a competitive advantage. However, our competitive landscape may change over time as new competitors enter the market. As we add new tests and services, we will face many of these same competitive risks for these new tests as well.
Patents and Proprietary Technology
In order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technologies. To that end, we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contracts, such as confidentiality, invention assignment and licensing agreements. We also rely upon trade secret laws to protect unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation. In addition, we have what we consider to be reasonable security measures in place to maintain confidentiality. Our intellectual property strategy is intended to develop and maintain our competitive position.
We apply for and in-license patents covering our products and technologies and uses thereof, as we deem appropriate; however, we may fail to apply for patents on important products and technologies in a timely fashion or at all, or we may fail to apply for patents in potentially relevant jurisdictions. Certain of our issued patents expire between 2024 and 2038 and are related to methods used in thyroid cancer diagnostics, urologic cancers diagnostics, lung cancer and disease diagnostics, breast cancer diagnostics, and immuno-oncology diagnostics. 
We intend to file additional patent applications in the United States and abroad to strengthen our intellectual property rights; however, our patent applications may not result in issued patents in a timely fashion or at all, and we cannot assure investors that any patents that have issued or might issue will protect our technology. We may receive notices of claims of potential infringement from third parties in the future.
We hold or in-license registered trademarks in the United States for “Veracyte,” “Afirma,” “Percepta,” “Envisia,” “Prosigna,” “Lymphmark,” “Decipher,” “GRID,” “HalioDx,” “Immunoscore,” “Brightplex,” “Immunosign,” and the Veracyte logo. We also hold registered trademarks in various jurisdictions outside of the United States.
We require all employees and consultants working for us to execute confidentiality agreements, which provide that all confidential information received by them during the course of the employment or consulting relationship be kept confidential, except in specified circumstances. Our agreements with our employees provide that all inventions, discoveries and other types of intellectual property, whether or not patentable or copyrightable, conceived by the individual while he or she is employed by us, are assigned to us. We cannot provide any assurance, however, that employees and consultants will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties might copy aspects of our technology or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. 
Environmental Matters
Our operations require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials) which subject us to a variety of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of these regulations provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others’, business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We cannot predict how changes in laws or new regulations will affect our business operations, or the cost of compliance. Historically, the cost of compliance for these safety laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment has not materially impacted our operations. There were no material capital expenditures related to environmental compliance in the 
year ended December 31, 2022. Similarly, we do not anticipate any significant expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
We procure reagents, equipment, and other materials that we use to perform our tests from sole suppliers. We also purchase components used in our collection kits from sole-source suppliers. Some of these items are unique to these suppliers and vendors. In addition, we utilize external providers to assemble and distribute our sample collection kits. While we have developed alternate sourcing strategies for these materials and vendors, we cannot be certain whether these strategies will be effective, or the alternative sources will be available when we need them. If these suppliers can no longer provide us with the materials we need to perform the tests and for our collection kits, if the materials do not meet our quality specifications or are otherwise unusable, if we cannot obtain acceptable substitute materials, if materials become unavailable due to COVID-19 related increases in demand for the materials, or if we elect to change suppliers, an interruption in test processing could occur, we may not be able to deliver patient reports and we may incur higher one-time switching costs. Any such interruption may significantly affect our future revenue, cause us to incur higher costs, and harm our customer relationships and reputation. In addition, in order to mitigate these risks, we maintain inventories of these supplies at higher levels than would be the case if multiple sources of supply were available. If our test volume decreases or we switch suppliers, we may hold excess inventory with expiration dates that occur before use which would adversely affect our losses and cash flow position. As we introduce any new test, we may experience supply issues as we ramp test volume.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may be party to lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. We are currently not a party to any material legal proceedings.
Regulation
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA
As a clinical reference laboratory, we are required to hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. We are subject to CLIA, a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that test specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. Under CLIA, which is administered by CMS, we are required to hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory examinations and tests we perform and to comply with standards covering personnel qualifications, facilities administration, quality systems, inspections, and proficiency testing. We must maintain CLIA compliance and certification to sell our tests and be eligible to bill state and federal healthcare programs, as well as many private third-party payers.
Moreover, if one of our clinical reference laboratories is out of compliance with CLIA requirements, we may be subject to sanctions such as suspension, limitation or revocation of our CLIA certificate, as well as directed plan of correction, state on-site monitoring, civil money penalties, civil injunctive suit or criminal penalties, or cancellation of our approval to receive payments under Medicare for our services. If we were to be found out of compliance with CLIA requirements and subjected to sanctions, our business could be harmed.
We hold CLIA certifications to perform testing at our South San Francisco and San Diego, California; Richmond, Virginia; and Austin, Texas laboratory locations. To renew our CLIA certificates, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may conduct random inspections of our clinical reference laboratories. If we in the future fail to maintain CLIA certificates in our laboratory locations, we would be unable to bill for services provided by state and federal healthcare programs, as well as many private third-party payers, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
State Laboratory Licensing
California Laboratory Licensing
In addition to federal certification requirements of laboratories under CLIA, licensure is required and maintained for our South San Francisco and San Diego, California and Richmond, Virginia clinical reference laboratories under California law. Such laws establish standards for the day-to-day operation of a clinical reference laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control. In addition, California laws mandate proficiency testing, which involves testing of specimens that have been specifically prepared for the laboratory.
If our clinical reference laboratories are out of compliance with California standards, the California Department of Public Health, or CDPH, may suspend, restrict or revoke our license to operate our clinical reference laboratories, assess substantial civil money penalties, or impose specific corrective action plans. Any such actions could materially affect our business. We maintain current licenses in good standing with CDPH. However, we cannot provide assurance that CDPH will at all times in the future find us to be in compliance with all such laws.
New York Laboratory Licensing
Our clinical reference laboratories are required to be licensed by New York, under New York laws and regulations before we receive specimens from New York. The New York laws and regulations establish standards for:
•quality management systems;
•qualifications, responsibilities, and training;
•facility design and resource management;
•pre-analytic, analytic (including validation and quality control), and post-analytic systems; and
•quality assessments and improvements.
New York law also mandates proficiency testing for laboratories licensed under New York law, regardless of whether such laboratories are located in New York. If a laboratory is out of compliance with New York statutory or regulatory standards, the New York State Department of Health, or NYSDOH, may suspend, limit, revoke or annul the laboratory's New York license, censure the holder of the license or assess civil money penalties. Statutory or regulatory noncompliance may result in a laboratory's operator being found guilty of a misdemeanor under New York law. NYSDOH also must approve laboratory developed tests before the test is offered in New York; approval has been received for the Afirma GSC, Envisia, Decipher Prostate and Decipher Bladder tests. NYSDOH approval has also been received for Percepta Nasal Swab in support of our clinical trial. Should we be found out of compliance with New York laboratory standards of practice, we could be subject to such sanctions, which could harm our business. We maintain a current license in good standing with NYSDOH for our South San Francisco and San Diego, California and Austin, Texas laboratories. We cannot provide assurance that the NYSDOH will at all times find us to be in compliance with applicable laws.
Other States' Laboratory Licensing
In addition to New York and California, other states require licensing of in-state and out-of-state laboratories under certain circumstances. For example, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Rhode Island require licenses to test specimens from patients in those states. We have obtained licenses from states where we believe we are required to be licensed and believe we are in compliance with applicable licensing laws.
From time to time, we may become aware of other states that require in-state or out-of-state laboratories to obtain licensure in order to accept specimens from, or conduct laboratory operations in, the state, and it is possible that other states will have such requirements in the future. If we identify any other state with such requirements or if we are contacted by any other state advising us of such requirements, we intend to comply with such requirements.
United States Regulation of Laboratory Testing
Food and Drug Administration: In Vitro Diagnostics and Diagnostic Kits
IVDs and diagnostic kits, including collection systems that are sold and distributed in the United States, are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. Devices subject to FDA regulation must undergo premarket review prior to commercialization unless exempt from such review. In addition, manufacturers of medical devices must comply with various regulatory requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and implementing regulations promulgated thereunder. Entities that fail to comply with FDA requirements may be subject to, among other things, issuance of inspectional observations on Form FDA-483, untitled or warning letters, recalls, import detentions, seizures, or injunctions, including orders to cease manufacturing, and can be liable for civil money penalties or criminal prosecution.
The FDC Act sets forth the classifications of medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and prescribes the levels of controls appropriate for each of the three classes to help ensure reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are considered to be low risk and are generally exempt from FDA premarket notification requirements. Class I devices are subject to general regulatory controls. When general controls are 
considered insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, but there is sufficient information to establish special controls to provide such assurance, FDA will classify the device as a Class II device. Unless exempt, for Class II devices, the FDC Act requires the submission to FDA of a premarket notification, referred to as a “510(k),” which must provide data and information showing that the device is substantially equivalent to an already legally marketed device, referred to as a predicate device, with respect to the indications for use and the product’s technological characteristics. If the data and information are sufficient to show that the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, FDA issues a Substantially Equivalent letter clearing the device for marketing. 
If there is insufficient information to support classifying a device into Class I or Class II and the device is life-sustaining or life-supporting or is substantially important in preventing impairment of human health or presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury, FDA places the device into Class III. Class III devices are considered the highest risk devices and generally require significant data and information, including testing data and data from nonclinical and clinical studies, to provide reasonable assurance of the device's safety and effectiveness. For Class III devices, FDA requires the submission and FDA approval of a premarket application, or PMA, before they can be marketed.
Certain devices are classified as Class III devices automatically, by operation of law, when the device does not have a predicate device or is found to not be substantially equivalent to a predicate device. If there is sufficient evidence to show that the device is a lower risk device, a manufacturer may ask FDA to reclassify the device into Class II or Class I by submitting a De Novo classification request. When FDA reclassifies a device through the De Novo process, other manufacturers of the same device type do not necessarily have to submit a De Novo request or a PMA in order to legally market the device. Instead, manufacturers can submit a 510(k), unless the device has been classified as 510(k)-exempt, to legally market their device, because the device that was the subject of the original De Novo request can serve as a predicate device for a substantial equivalence determination. If FDA does not issue an order granting the De Novo request for reclassification, the device will remain a Class III device and be subject to PMA requirements to obtain marketing authorization. 
Establishments that manufacture or, in certain situations, distribute FDA-related medical devices, including manufacturers, repackagers and relabelers, specification developers, and initial importers, are required to register and list their devices with the FDA, including payment of annual user fees.
Devices that may be legally marketed are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. These include: good manufacturing practice for medical devices as set out in the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, labeling regulations, restrictions on promotion and advertising, the Medical Device Reporting regulation, or MDR (which requires manufacturers to report certain adverse events and product malfunctions to the FDA), and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation (which requires manufacturers to report certain field actions to the FDA). Certain corrections and market removals may also be subject to FDA’s recall regulation and procedures. 
The FDA has issued a regulation outlining specific requirements for "specimen transport and storage containers." "Specimen transport and storage containers" are medical devices "intended to contain biological specimens, body waste, or body exudate during storage and transport" so that the specimen can be destroyed or used effectively for diagnostic examination. A specimen transport and storage container is classified as a Class I exempt device, which means that the device is exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement and, if not labeled or otherwise represented as sterile, the QSR, except for recordkeeping and complaint handling requirements. These 510(k) exempt devices are still subject to general controls, including MDR requirements, the reporting of corrections and removals, and establishment registration and product listing. 
In our FDA registration, we have listed the containers we provide for collection and transport of Afirma GSC and Envisia samples from a physician to our clinical reference laboratory as Class I devices in accordance with the classification of regulation for the specimen transport and storage container. If the FDA were to determine that our sample collection containers are not Class I devices, we may be required to file 510(k) premarket notifications and obtain FDA clearance to manufacture and market the containers, which could be time consuming and expensive.
The FDA enforces the requirements described above by various means, including inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from an Untitled Letter or Warning Letter to more severe sanctions such as:
•fines, injunctions, and civil money penalties;
•recall or seizure of products;
•operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; and
•criminal prosecution.
Federal Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests and Research Use Only Products
Clinical laboratory tests like our proprietary genomic tests are regulated under CLIA, as administered by CMS, as well as by applicable state laws. Clinical laboratory tests that are developed and run within a single CLIA-certified laboratory are referred to as laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, by the FDA. Currently, the FDA believes these tests meet the definition of a device under the FDC Act and that it has the authority to regulate them. However, the FDA is exercising enforcement discretion for LDTs, meaning the FDA is not currently enforcing the device regulations that the FDA would apply to such tests, although the FDA may continue to enforce device regulations with respect to certain reagents, instruments, software or components provided by third parties and used to perform LDTs. We believe that the Afirma and Envisia classifiers, as well as our Decipher Prostate and Bladder tests, have been developed and are performed in a manner consistent with the FDA’s enforcement discretion policy.
In October 2014, the FDA published a draft guidance document proposing a framework for the regulation of LDTs. In November 2016, the FDA announced that it would not finalize guidance and would instead work with the new Administration, Congress and stakeholders on an updated framework. In January 2017, the FDA issued a discussion paper on LDTs in which it synthesized stakeholder feedback and outlined a substantially revised "possible approach" to the oversight of LDTs, which did not represent a formal position of the FDA and is not enforceable. In a December 2018 statement, the FDA said that there is a need for “a unified approach to the regulation of in vitro clinical tests to protect patient safety, support innovation, and keep pace with the rapidly evolving technology that’s helping us find new treatments for disease,” and listed key principles of an approach it would support. The FDA has not exercised enforcement discretion over all LDTs. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA required LDTs for SARS-CoV-2 to undergo premarket review and obtain Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in order to remain on the market. The extent to which the FDA will continue to exercise enforcement discretion over other LDTs is unclear. Various legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years to clarify the FDA’s regulatory authority over clinical diagnostic tests. Even in the absence of a legislative change, it is possible that the FDA will promulgate regulations, issue guidance, or take other action to exert additional oversight over LDTs.
Some of the materials we use for our tests and that we may use for future tests are IVD products intended and labeled for research use only, or RUO, or investigational use only, or IUO. An RUO product cannot be used for any human clinical purpose and must be labeled "For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures." RUOs are a separate regulatory category and include IVD devices that are in the laboratory research phase of development. They are therefore not subject to most FDA regulatory requirements, so long as they are properly labeled and used in accordance with such labeling. RUOs cannot be marketed with any claims, or in a manner indicating, that the device is safe, effective, or has diagnostic utility, or is intended for human clinical diagnostic or prognostic use. In November 2013, the FDA issued final guidance titled “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only” regarding the distribution, use, and labeling of IVD products labeled RUO or IUO. The FDA has advised that if evidence demonstrates that a product is inappropriately labeled for research or investigational use only, the device would be considered misbranded and adulterated within the meaning of the FDC Act. In the guidance, the FDA stated that the manufacturer’s objective intent for an RUO or IUO product’s intended use will be determined by examining the totality of circumstances, including advertising, instructions for clinical interpretation, presentations that describe clinical use, and specialized technical support, surrounding the distribution of the product in question.
We cannot predict the ultimate form or impact of any such RUO/IUO, LDT or other guidance and the potential effect on our solutions or materials used to perform or develop our diagnostic services. While we qualify all materials used in our diagnostic services according to CLIA regulations, we cannot be certain that the FDA might not promulgate rules or issue guidance documents that could affect our ability to purchase materials necessary for the performance of our diagnostic services. Should any of the reagents obtained by us from vendors and used in conducting our diagnostic services be affected by future regulatory actions, our business could be adversely affected by those actions, including increasing the cost of service or delaying, limiting or prohibiting the purchase of reagents necessary to perform the service.
We cannot provide any assurance that FDA premarket review or other requirements will not be imposed in the future for our diagnostic services, whether through additional guidance or regulations issued by the FDA, new enforcement policies adopted by the FDA or new legislation enacted by Congress. Legislative proposals addressing oversight of LDTs were introduced in recent years, including the Verifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development (VALID) Act of 2018 in December 2018, the most recent version of which was released in July 2022, and we expect that new legislative proposals will be introduced from time to time. It is possible that legislation could be enacted into law or regulations, or guidance could be 
issued by the FDA which may result in new or increased regulatory requirements for us to continue to offer our tests or to develop and introduce new tests.
If premarket review, clearance, or approval is required for the tests that we market as LDTs, our business could be negatively affected until such review is completed and clearance or approval to market is obtained, and the FDA could require that we stop selling our tests pending premarket clearance or approval. If our tests are allowed to remain on the market but there is uncertainty about the legal status of our services, if we are required by the FDA to label them investigational, or if the FDA limits the use and corresponding labeling claims, order levels may decline, and reimbursement may be adversely affected. The regulatory process may involve, among other things, successfully completing additional clinical studies and submitting to the FDA a premarket notification to obtain clearance or submitting a De Novo classification request or PMA to obtain approval to market the device. If clearance or approval is required by the FDA, there can be no assurance that our tests will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all, nor can there be any assurance that approved labeling claims or labeling claims subject to cleared indications for use will be consistent with our current claims or adequate to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for our solutions. Ongoing compliance with FDA regulations would increase the cost of conducting our business, and subject us to heightened requirements of the FDA and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. We may also decide voluntarily to pursue FDA premarket review of our tests to obtain marketing clearance or approval if we determine that doing so would be appropriate.
European Union Regulation of Laboratory Testing
Directive 98/79/EC
In the European Union, or EU, IVDs were previously regulated under EU-Directive 98/79/EC, or the IVDD, and corresponding national provisions.
The IVDD requires that IVDs meet certain essential requirements, which are set out in an annex of the IVDD. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, IVDs must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of IVDs and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use.
IVDs must bear the CE marking of conformity when they are placed on the market, unless a specific exemption applies. Compliance with the IVDD essential requirements is a prerequisite for a manufacturer to be able to affix a CE mark, which is a declaration by the manufacturer that the IVD meets all the appropriate requirements under the IVDD and corresponding national provisions, as applicable.
Under the IVDD, for most IVDs manufacturers used to “self-declare” the conformity of their IVDs with the essential requirements of the IVDD. For some types of IVDs listed in Annex II of the IVDD, a conformity assessment procedure required the intervention of a notified body. Notified regulatory bodies are independent organizations designated by Member States to assess the conformity with the essential requirements of medical devices, including IVDs when required, before a CE mark is affixed to the device and the device is placed on the market. The notified body would typically audit and examine the device’s technical file and the manufacturer’s quality system, though conformity with the relevant harmonized standards – which is ISO 13485:2016 for Quality Management Systems – can be used to demonstrate compliance with these requirements. If satisfied that the IVD conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity.
In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulations (2017/746)
The EU regulatory landscape concerning medical devices and IVDs is significantly changing. The IVDD was replaced with the full implementation of the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulations (2017/746), or IVDR, in the EU on 26 May 2022. This is, however, subject to relevant transitional periods, as amended.
The main aims of the IVDR are to standardize diagnostic procedures throughout the EU, increase reliability of diagnostic analysis and enhance patient safety. As such, IVDs will be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny once the IVDR has come into force fully. 
The IVDR introduces a rule-based classification system, whereby IVDs must be classified into one of four classes: A, B, C or D. Class A is the lowest risk, and Class D is the highest. These take into account the intended purpose of the IVD and its inherent risks. The IVDR also introduces new requirements for conformity assessments. In particular, substantially more IVDs 
will require the involvement of a notified body to be able to affix a CE mark to the IVD. In addition, under the IVDR there is a greater emphasis on post-market surveillance and submission of post-market performance follow-up reports.
Many LDTs, or in-house tests, were not regulated by the IVDD. However, the IVDR sets out a number of provisions that apply to such tests, and requirements that must be met in order to be able to place the test on the market in the EU. The IVDR also introduces a new classification system for companion diagnostics which are now specifically defined. Companion diagnostics have to undergo a conformity assessment by a notified body. Before it can issue a certificate of conformity, the notified body has to seek a scientific opinion from the European Medicines Agency or the relevant national competent authority on the suitability of the companion diagnostic to the medicinal product concerned.
IVDs with existing valid notified body-issued CE certificates may currently continue to place those devices on the market (if unchanged) until 27 May 2024 or until their certificate expires, whichever occurs first. However, it is estimated that 80-90% of IVDs will not qualify for this grace period because they are self-certified under the IVDD but will require the involvement of a notified body to obtain a CE mark and demonstrate compliance with the IVDR. Due to the lack of capacity on the part of EU notified regulatory bodies to deal with the volume of IVDs requiring their input, the EU Commission adopted a proposal to amend the transitional provisions of the IVDR. This proposal would extend certain transitional provisions where IVDs can continue to be placed on the market under the IVDD for a certain period of time. The applicable amended transitional periods are based on the risk class of the IVD, with higher risk IVDs needing to be fully compliant with the IVDR in a shorter time period than lower risk IVDs.
United Kingdom, or UK, Regulation of Laboratory Testing
Following the UK’s departure from the EU, the IVDR will not be implemented in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). The previous UK legislation that implemented the IVDD, the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended), or the 2002 Regulations, remains applicable. As such, the regulatory regime for IVDs in Great Britain will continue to be based on the requirements derived from the IVDD, though the UK is currently conducting a consultation on the medical device and IVD regime, including whether to align with the IVDR going forward.
Since January 1, 2021, new regulations require medical devices and IVDs to be registered with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, before being placed on Great Britain market (but manufacturers were given a grace period of four to 12 months to comply with the new registration process). The MHRA will only register devices where the manufacturer or their UK Responsible Person has a registered place of business in the UK. As such, manufacturers based outside the UK need to appoint a UK Responsible Person that has a registered place of business in the UK to register devices with the MHRA in line with the grace periods. 
In addition, a new route to market and accompanying mark, the UKCA, has been introduced to enable manufacturers to place medical devices and IVDs on the market in Great Britain. The requirements for this route to market are based on the requirements derived from EU law as currently implemented in the UK. CE marks and certificates issued by EU-designated notified regulatory bodies will continue to be valid for the Great Britain market until June 30, 2023. For medical devices, including IVDs, placed on the market in Great Britain after this period, the UKCA marking will be mandatory. In contrast, UKCA marking and certificates issued by UK notified regulatory bodies are not recognized on the EU market.
The position in Northern Ireland is different to Great Britain. The rules for placing medical devices and IVDs on the Northern Ireland market align with the rules in the EU and, as such, the IVDR will apply in Northern Ireland and will take effect in accordance with EU timeframes and transitional periods. Therefore, devices marketed in Northern Ireland will require assessment according to the EU regulatory regime. Such assessment may be conducted by an EU notified body, in which case a CE mark will be required before placing the device on the market in the EU or Northern Ireland. Alternatively, if a UK notified body conducts such assessment, a “UKNI” mark will be applied, and the device may only be placed on the market in Northern Ireland and not the EU.
Privacy and Fraud and Abuse Compliance
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and State Data Privacy Laws
Under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by covered entities, which include health care providers, such as us. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. In 
2009, Congress amended HIPAA through the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. The implementing regulations of HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, were last modified in 2013 and resulted in significant changes to the privacy, security, breach notification, and enforcement requirements with which we must comply. Among these changes, covered entities are now vicariously liable for violations of HIPAA resulting from acts or omissions of their business associates where the business associate is an agent of the covered entity and was acting within the scope of its agency, regardless of whether the covered entity and business associate entered into a business associate agreement in compliance with HIPAA. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties. Additionally, HHS on January 21, 2021 and November 28, 2022 issued notices of proposed rulemaking that contain proposed modifications to the HIPAA regulations in relation to substance use disorder records as well as efforts to encourage coordination of care for patients. In the event that HHS issues final changes to the HIPAA regulations based on its proposals in the notices of proposed rulemaking, we would be required in the future to comply with the HIPAA regulations as amended.
We have developed and implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with HIPAA’s privacy, security, and breach notification requirements. We may not use or disclose protected health information in any form, including electronic, written, or oral, in a manner that is not permitted under HIPAA, and we are required to implement security measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the electronic protected health information that we create, receive, maintain, or transmit. While we have some flexibility in determining which security safeguards are reasonable and appropriate to implement for our operations, it nonetheless requires significant effort and expense to ensure continuing compliance with the HIPAA security rule. We are also required to comply with the administrative simplification standards under HIPAA when we conduct the electronic transactions regulated by HIPAA, including by using standard code sets and formats and standardized identifiers for health plans and providers. The requirements under HIPAA and its implementing regulations may change periodically and could have an effect on our business operations if compliance becomes substantially costlier than under current requirements.
In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality of health information that are applicable to our business. In particular, we are subject to the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, which is similar to but in some ways more restrictive than the HIPAA regulations, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which was enacted in California in 2018 and substantially amended and expanded thereafter, most significantly by a ballot initiative adopted in November 2020 that enacted the California Privacy Rights Act. The California Privacy Rights Act amends and substantially expands the CCPA. The CCPA, among other things, requires covered companies to provide disclosures to California consumers concerning the collection and sale of personal information, and gives such consumers the right to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The amendments to the CCPA that were adopted by ballot initiative include provisions creating a new category of “sensitive personal information” that is subject to more stringent protections than other personal information, and new requirements regarding sharing personal information for advertising purposes. In addition, the amendments established a new California Privacy Protection Agency, which has authority both to implement and enforce the CCPA. The new agency is currently drafting implementing regulations that are expected to become effective July 1, 2023, and is anticipated to be vigorous in its enforcement actions. At the same time, other states, including Colorado and Virginia, have enacted CCPA-like laws, and other states are expected to follow suit. Monitoring the development, enactment and implementation of these laws and regulations issued pursuant to them adds to our compliance costs and we face penalties if we fail to adopt comprehensive compliance measures, including documenting the steps we have taken to comply.
EU and UK Data Protection Regime
The processing of personal data, including patients’ personal health data, in the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the UK is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data, including inter alia stringent requirements relating to lawful and legitimate basis and purposes for the processing of personal data, the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, appointment of data protection officers, conclusion of data processing agreements, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements, and creates direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. 
The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection. Until recently, one such data transfer mechanism was the EU-US Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated for international transfers of personal data in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU. Following the CJEU’s decision and an executive order issued by President Biden on October 7, 2022, the European Commission on December 13, 2022 announced that it had begun the process of adopting a new adequacy decision that would permit data transfers to the United States under an updated EU-US Data Privacy Framework and attempt to address the 
shortcomings of the Privacy Shield identified in the CJEU’s decision. If the new adequacy decision is ultimately adopted by the European Commission, some uncertainty would remain as it is widely expected that the new adequacy decision will also be challenged before the CJEU. Separately, the CJEU upheld the validity of standard contractual clauses, or SCCs, as a legal mechanism to transfer personal data but companies relying on SCCs will, subject to additional guidance from regulators in the EEA, need to evaluate and implement supplementary measures that provide privacy protections additional to those provided under SCCs. It remains to be seen whether SCCs will remain available. 
Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines up to €20 million or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. In June 2021, the CJEU issued a ruling that expanded the scope of the “one stop shop” under the GDPR. According to the ruling, the competent authorities of EU Member States may, under certain strict conditions, bring claims to their national courts against a company for breaches of the GDPR, including unlawful cross-border processing activities, even if such company does not have an establishment in the EU member state in question and the competent authority bringing the claim is not the lead supervisory authority.
In addition, further to the UK’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020, but subject to certain UK-specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. With respect to transfers of personal data from the EEA to the UK, on June 28, 2021, the European Commission issued an adequacy decision in respect of the UK’s data protection framework, enabling data transfers from EU member states to the UK to continue without requiring organizations to put in place contractual or other measures in order to lawfully transfer personal data between the territories. While it is intended to last for at least four years, the European Commission may unilaterally revoke the adequacy decision at any point, and, if this occurs, it could lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure.
Other Privacy Laws
New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future from time to time. We have taken steps to comply with health information privacy requirements to which we are aware that we are subject. For example, the Personal Information Protection Law, or PIPL, was recently implemented in China, and broadly regulates the processing of personal information and imposes compliance obligations and penalties comparable to those of the GDPR. However, we can provide no assurance that we are or will remain in compliance with diverse privacy requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Failure to comply with privacy requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.
Corporate Practice of Medicine
Numerous states, including California and Texas, have enacted laws prohibiting corporations such as us from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine. These laws are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. This prohibition is generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. Violation of this prohibition may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against us or the professional through licensing proceedings. The pathologists who review and classify thyroid FNA cytopathology results for Afirma are employed by TCP, a Texas professional association, pursuant to services agreement between us and TCP. Pursuant to the agreement, we pay TCP a monthly fee on a per FNA basis, and TCP manages and supervises the pathologists who perform the cytopathology services as a component of the Afirma solution.
Federal and State Physician Self-Referral Prohibitions
We are subject to the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, and to similar restrictions under the self-referral prohibitions of certain states in which we operate, including California's Physician Ownership and Referral Act, or PORA. Together these restrictions generally prohibit us from billing a patient or any governmental or private payer for any diagnostic services when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician's immediate family, has an investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition.
Both the Stark Law and PORA contain an exception for compensation paid to a physician for personal services rendered by the physician meeting certain contractual requirements. We have compensation arrangements with a number of physicians for personal services, such as speaking engagements and consulting activities. We have structured these arrangements with terms intended to comply with the requirements of the personal services exception to Stark and PORA.
However, we cannot be certain that regulators would find these arrangements to be in compliance with Stark, PORA or similar state laws. We would be required to refund any payments we receive pursuant to a referral prohibited by these laws to the patient, the payer or the Medicare program, as applicable.
Sanctions for a violation of the Stark Law include the following:
•denial of payment for the services provided in violation of the prohibition;
•refunds of amounts collected by an entity in violation of the Stark Law;
•a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral;
•possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; and
•a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law's prohibition.
These prohibitions apply regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. No finding of intent to violate the Stark Law is required for a violation. In addition, knowing violations of the Stark Law may also serve as the basis for liability under the Federal False Claims Act which prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. Government.
Further, a violation of PORA is a misdemeanor and could result in civil penalties and criminal fines. Finally, other states have self-referral restrictions with which we have to comply that differ from those imposed by federal and California law. While we have attempted to comply with the Stark Law, PORA and similar laws of other states, it is possible that some of our financial arrangements with physicians could be subject to regulatory scrutiny at some point in the future, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be found to be in compliance with these laws following any such regulatory review.
Federal and State Anti-Kickback Laws
The federal Anti-kickback Statute makes it a felony for any person or entity, including a laboratory, to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program. A violation of the Anti-kickback Statute may result in imprisonment for up to ten years and criminal fines of up to $100,000. Convictions under the Anti-kickback Statute result in mandatory exclusion from federal health care programs for a minimum of five years. In addition, HHS has the authority to impose civil assessments and fines and to exclude health care providers and others engaged in prohibited activities from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. Actions which violate the Anti-kickback Statute can also lead to liability under the Federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. Government.
Although the federal Anti-kickback Statute applies only to federal health care programs, a number of states, including California, have passed statutes substantially similar to the Anti-kickback Statute pursuant to which similar types of prohibitions are made applicable to all other health plans and third-party payers. California's fee-splitting and Anti-kickback Statute, Business and Professions Code Section 650, and its Medi-Cal Anti-kickback statute, Welfare and Institutions Code Section 14107.2, have been interpreted by the California Attorney General and California courts in substantially the same way as HHS and the courts have interpreted the federal Anti-kickback Statute. A violation of Section 650 is punishable by imprisonment and fines of up to $50,000. A violation of Section 14107.2 is punishable by imprisonment and fines of up to $10,000.
Federal and state law enforcement authorities scrutinize arrangements between health care providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to induce patient care referrals or induce the purchase or prescribing of particular products or services. The law enforcement authorities, the courts and Congress have also demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between health care providers and actual or potential referral sources. Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the Anti-kickback Statute, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce or reward referrals or purchases.
The federal Anti-kickback Statute includes statutory exceptions and provides for a number of regulatory safe harbors. If an arrangement meets the provisions of a safe harbor, it is deemed not to violate the Anti-kickback Statute. An arrangement must fully comply with each element of an applicable safe harbor in order to qualify for protection. Many state anti-kickback statutes have analogous exceptions or safe harbors to those of the federal Anti-kickback Statute. These state anti-kickback statutes have generally been interpreted consistently with the Anti-kickback Statute.
Among the safe harbors that may be relevant to us is the discount safe harbor. The discount safe harbor potentially applies to discounts provided by providers and suppliers, including laboratories, to physicians or institutions. If the terms of the discount safe harbor are met, the discounts will not be considered prohibited remuneration under the Anti-kickback Statute. California does not have a discount safe harbor. However, as noted above, Section 650 has generally been interpreted consistent with the Anti-kickback Statute.
The personal services safe harbor to the Anti-kickback Statute provides that remuneration paid for personal services will not violate the Anti-kickback Statute provided all of the elements of that safe harbor are met. Our personal services arrangements with some physicians and other parties may not meet each requirement of this safe harbor. Failure to meet the terms of this, or any other, safe harbor does not necessarily render an arrangement illegal. Rather, the government may evaluate such arrangements on a case-by-case basis under the language of the statute, taking into account all facts and circumstances.
While we believe that we are in compliance with the Anti-kickback Statute, Section 650, and Section 14107.2, there can be no assurance that our relationships with physicians, academic institutions and other customers or parties will not be subject to investigation or challenge under such laws. If imposed for any reason, sanctions under the Anti-kickback Statute, Section 650, or Section 14107.2 could have a negative effect on our business.
Other Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
In addition to the requirements discussed above, several other health care fraud and abuse laws could have an effect on our business. For example, provisions of the Social Security Act permit Medicare and Medicaid to exclude an entity that charges the federal health care programs substantially in excess of its usual charges for its services. The terms "usual charge" and "substantially in excess" are ambiguous and subject to varying interpretations, though the HHS’ Office of the Inspector General, or HHS-OIG, has provided some guidance on the topic.
Further, the federal False Claims Act prohibits a person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim to, making a false record or statement in order to secure payment from or retaining an overpayment by the federal government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party, known as a relator or commonly referred to as a whistleblower, having knowledge of the alleged fraud. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even made aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the relator succeeds in obtaining redress without the government's involvement, then the relator will receive a percentage of the recovery. Finally, the Social Security Act includes its own provisions that prohibit the filing of false claims or submitting false statements in order to obtain payment. Violation of these provisions may result in up to treble damages, substantial civil penalties, fines, imprisonment or combination of the above, and possible exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid programs. California has an analogous state false claims act applicable to all payers, as do many other states; however, we may not be aware of all such rules and statutes and cannot provide assurance that we will be in compliance with all such laws and regulations.
In general, in recent years U.S. Attorneys’ Offices have increased scrutiny of the healthcare industry, as have Congress, the Department of Justice, the HHS-OIG and the Department of Defense. These bodies have all issued subpoenas and other requests for information to conduct investigations of, and commenced civil and criminal litigation against, healthcare companies based on financial arrangements with health care providers, regulatory compliance, product promotional practices and documentation, and coding and billing practices. Whistleblowers have filed numerous qui tam lawsuits against healthcare companies under the federal and state False Claims Acts in recent years, in part because the whistleblower can receive a portion of the government’s recovery under such suits.
In addition, in October 2018, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018, or EKRA, was enacted as part of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (P.L 115-271). This law prohibits the solicitation, receipt, payment or offering of any remuneration in return for referring a patient or patronage to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory for services covered by both government and private payers. EKRA also applies to the payment or offering of remuneration in 
exchange for an individual using the services of a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. To date, neither the Department of Justice nor HHS has issued guidance further interpreting or implementing EKRA.
Finally, under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, laboratories are required to report to CMS the private payer payment rates and test volumes paid by private payers based on final payments made during a specific “data collection period.” This data reporting requirement is triennial for most clinical diagnostic laboratory tests (annual for ADLTs), with the first data reporting period occurring in 2017 for final payments made in January through June 2016. The next data reporting period will be in 2024 for final payments made in January through June 2019. When reporting data under PAMA, the President, CEO, or CFO of a reporting entity, or an individual who has been delegated authority to sign for, and who reports directly to, such an officer, must sign the certification statement and be responsible for assuring that the data provided are accurate, complete, and truthful, and meets all the required reporting parameters. Failure to report or misrepresentation or omission in reporting can result in civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day for each violation and other penalties. We believe we are in compliance with the PAMA reporting requirements, but there can be no assurance that our reporting practices will not be scrutinized under the PAMA regulations.
International
Many countries in which we may offer any of our tests in the future have anti-kickback regulations prohibiting providers from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any national health care program. The IVDD and IVDR prohibit the offer of inducements, particularly financial, that might influence the judgement of notified regulatory bodies and their personnel to carry out their conformity assessment activities. The IVDD and IVDR do not address the question of inducements offered to healthcare professionals or other third parties, though Member States may implement their own national laws in this regard. For example, Sapin II is the French anti-corruption law, which imposes regulations to prevent and detect bribery and corruption through increased corporate transparency, reinforced internal monitoring, and enhanced whistleblower protection. In the UK, the 2002 Regulations do not address the question of inducements offered to healthcare professionals to prescribe, sell, supply or recommend use of a particular medical device or IVD or to offer the relevant device company any other benefit. These activities are, however, prohibited by the Bribery Act 2010, which provides general offenses relating to bribery and receiving a bribe. 
In addition, the largest medical device manufacturer’s industry association, MedTech Europe, issues a Code of Business Practice, or the MedTech Code, which is obligatory for its member associations and member companies, and regulates their interactions with the medical community and other stakeholders. The MedTech Code prevents member companies from offering and providing educational grants to individual health care providers with certain exceptions and has phased out the provision of financial or in-kind support directly to individual health care providers to cover costs for their attendance at third-party organized educational events (with the exception of procedure training). It also sets out transparency obligations with regard to all interactions with health care providers, in terms of notification to the health care provider’s superiors or relevant health institutions before the interaction may take place, disclosure of payments (made as educational grants) and a centralized platform for the approval of conferences and other events.
In situations involving physicians employed by state-funded institutions or national health care agencies, violation of the local anti-kickback law may also constitute a violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA. The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual, business entity or employee of a U.S. business entity to offer or provide, directly or through a third party, including any potential distributors we may rely on in certain markets, anything of value to a foreign government official with corrupt intent to influence an award or continuation of business or to gain an unfair advantage, whether or not such conduct violates local laws. In addition, it is illegal for a company that reports to the SEC to have false or inaccurate books or records or to fail to maintain a system of internal accounting controls. We will also be required to maintain accurate information and control over sales and distributors' activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA, its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions.
The standard of intent and knowledge in FCPA anti-bribery cases is minimal -- intent and knowledge are usually inferred from that fact that bribery took place. The accounting provisions do not require intent. Violations of the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions for corporations and other business entities are subject to a fine of up to $2 million and officers, directors, stockholders, employees, and agents are subject to a fine of up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to five years. Other countries, including other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Anti-Bribery Convention members, have similar anti-corruption regulations.
When marketing our tests outside of the United States, we may be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing, prohibitions on the import of tissue necessary for us to perform our tests or restrictions on the export of 
tissue imposed by countries outside of the United States or the import of tissue into the United States, and marketing approval. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the United States and may in some cases require us to perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. In many countries outside of the United States, coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required.
