Item 1. Business
Our Mission
Our mission is to empower the restaurant community to delight their guests, do what they love, and thrive.
Overview
Toast is a cloud-based, all-in-one digital technology platform purpose-built for the entire restaurant community. Our platform provides a comprehensive suite of software as a service, or SaaS, products, financial technology solutions including integrated payment processing, restaurant-grade hardware, and a broad ecosystem of third-party partners. We serve as the restaurant operating system, connecting front of house and back of house operations across dine-in, takeout, and delivery channels. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 79,000 restaurant locations, processing over $92 billion of gross payment volume in the trailing 12 months, partnered with Toast to optimize operations, increase sales, engage guests, and maintain happy employees.
Our Market
The approximately 860,000 restaurant locations in the United States are highly diverse and complex. In general, restaurants operate with low margins, high employee turnover, highly perishable products, and complex regulations. At the same time, the restaurant industry is undergoing foundational changes driven by heightened food cost due to inflation, labor constraints, evolving guest preferences, and the imperative to utilize technology and data to innovate. What was once primarily an on-site experience with antiquated solutions is now becoming an omnichannel experience with restaurants employing technology to enable a range of additional service models, including curbside pick-up, delivery, wholesale, and catering. 
Consumer preference towards omnichannel dining options has continued to accelerate following the COVID-19 pandemic. With restaurants operating in an increasingly dynamic environment, it is critical that we provide our customers with the tools they need to drive revenue and best serve their guests. As the diversity of how guests order, where guests eat, and the means guests use to pay continues to grow, restaurants must constantly adapt to support these trends. We have seen this pattern result in an increase in the number of service models restaurants offer, allowing guests to choose the type of service that best suits them. 
We believe we are in the early stages of capturing our addressable market opportunity. As of December 31, 2022, the locations on our platform represented less than 10% of the approximately 860,000 restaurant locations in the United States. Similarly, our Annualized Recurring Run-Rate, or ARR, as of December 31, 2022 was only about 2% of our total U.S addressable market opportunity of approximately $55 billion. We see a significant opportunity to increase sales to both new and existing customers, expand the usage of our platform outside the United States, and address the diverse needs of new and existing restaurant industry stakeholders.
Our Products and Platform
Toast’s all-in-one platform powers the entire restaurant community. Our portfolio spans several product categories: restaurant operations & point of sale, digital ordering & delivery, marketing & loyalty, team management, supply chain & accounting, financial technology solutions, and platform & insights. Alongside this platform, our commitment to customer success drives a differentiated customer experience, powers operational innovation, and enables our and our restaurants’ long-term growth and success.
As restaurants adopt more of our platform, our solutions work better together to drive even more success for them. For example, as restaurants adopt our digital ordering solutions such as Order & Pay and Online Ordering, they can collect guest data that was previously not available to them. This guest data can then fuel our marketing and loyalty solutions, increasing the likelihood of a return visit to the restaurant, thus helping increase sales or drive more guests to the restaurant’s online ordering channel with Toast, eliminating a third-party commission driving incremental margin for the restaurant.
Restaurant Operations & Point of Sale
•Software. Our Android-based software has been custom built for the restaurant industry and is the foundation that powers each of our vertically integrated solutions. Our proprietary software enables seamless connectivity across restaurant operations, guests, and employees, and drives a differentiated dining experience.
◦Toast POS: Our core software module integrates payment processing with point of sale functionality tailored for the needs of restaurants of all types and sizes. Our products help drive reduced wait times, optimize operations, and seamlessly handle payments. Toast POS is easy to use, leverages consumer technology, allows restaurant employees to quickly get up to speed on the software and seamlessly use it throughout their day. We provide color coded tables and kitchen tickets, mobile alerts, and guest text messaging to help keep restaurant staff on top of their service. For example, when a dish is ready, kitchen staff can alert the server right on their Toast Go or send a text message directly to a guest for a pick-up order.
◦Toast Invoicing: Our invoicing product allows restaurants to easily send invoices to customers and collect payment, streamlining operations and simplifying transactions for all types of orders and events.
◦Toast Mobile Order & Pay: Our order and pay solutions allow guests to scan a QR code to browse the menu, order, and pay, all from their mobile device. This allows restaurants to have additional flexibility in staffing while providing a great restaurant experience, driving sales, capturing guest insights, and reducing table turn times.
◦Kitchen Display System: Our proprietary Kitchen Display System software seamlessly connects the front of the house with the kitchen staff. Our software fully integrates all ordering stations with the kitchen, automates firing by prep time, and instantaneously notifies servers when orders are ready.
◦Multi-Location Management: Our Multi-Location Management tool allows our customers to manage and standardize their operations and easily configure menus across multiple locations and channels, including online ordering and delivery. Customers can set location-specific items and prices or keep them consistent across the brand, and centralize data across all locations for a single, clear view of business performance.
•Hardware. Our restaurant-grade hardware is custom built to withstand the rigors of a restaurant, combining durability needed for the restaurant environment, with aesthetically pleasing designs and in-store branding, serving as the tool that helps deliver our end-to-end solutions.
◦Toast Flex: Our proprietary hardware can be used for on-counter order and pay, but can also be used as a server station, guest kiosk, kitchen display system, or order fulfillment station, allowing the restaurant to “flex” our hardware to fit their specific needs. Toast Flex comes in different formats optimized for specific use cases and built to stand the real-world environment in a restaurant. 
◦Toast Go: Our fully-integrated, handheld POS device enhances the guest experience and improves table turn times through tableside ordering and payment acceptance. Toast Go enables real-time menu updates, accelerated service, easy and accurate ordering, and contactless payments.
◦Toast Tap: Our proprietary card reader supports the acceptance of EMV-contactless payments for payment methods using Near Field Communication, or NFC, technology, EMV-dip payments for payment cards with an integrated chip, and magnetic stripe payments, creating a frictionless experience for our guests.
◦Kiosk: Our proprietary self ordering Kiosk puts guests in control of their dining experience, while freeing up staff to handle other duties.
Digital Ordering & Delivery
•Toast Online Ordering & Toast TakeOut: Our commission-free online ordering and consumer Toast TakeOut application simplifies the digital ordering experience for guests, increases order accuracy, and allows restaurants to reduce reliance on third parties for driving online orders. By providing restaurants with a software-based platform to take off-premise orders directly, we reduce phone orders, minimize double entry and other costly errors, and optimize the balance between dine-in and takeout.
•First-Party Delivery, Toast Delivery Services: Toast enables restaurants to offer delivery services in a variety of ways that can be tailored to their needs and operations. With first-party delivery, restaurants can manage their own fleet of drivers and customize delivery hours, zones, fees, and minimum ticket sizes. Toast Delivery Services enables restaurants to utilize a partner network of delivery drivers so restaurants can offer delivery to guests without needing their own fleet.
•Third-Party Delivery Integrations and Orders Hub: Through Toast Delivery Partners, we provide POS integrations for restaurants using third-party delivery services to streamline order intake, eliminate the need for extra third-party tablets, and sync menus in real-time.
 Marketing and Loyalty
•Loyalty: Toast has designed a suite of guest-focused products to enhance a restaurant’s cash flow by driving further engagement with their guests. Our credit-card linked loyalty program automatically accrues points each time the guest swipes their card and offers can be customized by the restaurant to drive repeat visits and increased spend over time.
•Email Marketing: Our data driven insights allow restaurants to easily create and send email campaigns based on POS data such as visit frequency and spending patterns that are automatically built through daily guest interactions across our product suite.
•Toast Gift Cards: Toast allows customers to sell gift cards on their website or online ordering site and through physical branded cards. 
Team Management
•Payroll & Team Management: Employee performance and satisfaction are important elements of a restaurant’s success. We have created a centralized hub that streamlines the entire employee onboarding, management, and payroll process. Integrated POS and payroll create a single employee record across systems, allowing for hours, tips, and employee data to synchronize seamlessly and helping managers get valuable time back. 
•Sling for Toast: Employee management tools, such as Sling for Toast, provide streamlined scheduling and team communication. Through in-app messaging and multi-location team management, Sling for Toast helps restaurants staff more efficiently, better manage labor costs, and increase employee job satisfaction. 
•Toast Pay Card & PayOut: Toast Pay Card & PayOut allows customers to offer eligible workers instant access to a portion of their tips and wages as soon as their shift ends, or in some cases, the next day.1
•Tips Manager: Our Tips Manager product automates the tip-pooling process, allowing customers to manage tips in one place, with credit card and cash tips automatically pulled through to Toast Payroll & Team Management.
•Partner-Enabled Products (Insurance & Benefits): Toast offers workers compensation, business owner policy, or BOP, insurance, automated 401k, as well as restaurant-specific add-ons, such as liquor liability insurance, through our partners therefore simplifying the procurement process for restaurants and providing much-requested benefits to their teams.
Supply Chain & Accounting
•xtraCHEF by Toast: xtraCHEF provides a suite of back-office tools for restaurants, including accounts payable automation, inventory management, ingredient price tracker, and recipe costing. xtraCHEF arms operators to take control of rising inventory costs, automate accounts payable, and streamline back-office tasks to help increase overall profitability.
Financial Technology Solutions
•Payment Processing: Toast provides a fully-integrated platform that enables our customers to securely accept and process payments, while also providing valuable data-driven insights and driving our guest engagement programs. We maintain competitive and clear pricing, our systems are in compliance with PCI Security Council standards, and our hardware supports EMV and NFC payment technology.
1 Toast Pay Cards are issued by Sutton Bank, Member FDIC, pursuant to license by Mastercard®.

We are uniquely positioned to provide our restaurants with access to capital using patented systems for loan origination that incorporate data science models, historical point of sale data, and payment processing volume, and have created a straightforward process that can deliver urgently needed funds as soon as the next business day.
•Purchase Financing: We also offer a number of ways for customers to finance the upfront cost of Toast products, often one of the largest barriers to switching to or purchasing a new POS system. Our programs include access to 0% interest financing and Toast Easy Pay for investments made in Toast products. Toast Easy Pay allows customers to pay for hardware, onboarding and implementation, shipping and handling, and taxes as a percentage of sales with a 180-day lease. The flexibility we offer has had a measurable impact on our rapid location growth.
Platform and Insights
•Reporting and Analytics: Our differentiated software and financial technology ecosystem underpins our data collection and analytics capabilities, providing insights and reporting on real-time sales, menu, and labor data, and allowing our customers to analyze their results and improve performance over time. Our cloud-based reporting enables access to performance data regardless of physical location, and our automatic nightly email sends key business metrics directly to our customers, sharing the critical daily insights they need to successfully operate their business. We estimate that on any given day, approximately two-thirds of Toast locations engage with reporting in their restaurant dashboard.
•Toast Partner Connect and APIs: Toast’s partner ecosystem allows our customers to customize their technology stack to meet their business needs, choosing from a curated portfolio of over 200 partners that deliver a broad spectrum of specialized solutions. Toast Partner Connect is a portal within Toast that allows customers to discover, select, and seamlessly connect their restaurant to our partners. Our suite of bi-directional application programming interfaces, or APIs, connects our partners to our workflows and data, and also allows our customers to connect custom applications and software to our ecosystem.
Our Technology
We empower our customers to take control of their operations by utilizing our proprietary technology that spans across our products. Each of our products is built on Toast’s shared platform infrastructure and services. This platform layer provides common capabilities and reusable components, allowing a streamlined, integrated customer experience to be built efficiently by our independent teams.
Our digital technology platform includes:
Software, cloud-based services, and partner ecosystem
•Reliable cloud services. Our highly scalable, services-based, multi-tenant architecture runs on Amazon Web Services.
•Offline POS capabilities. In the event of an internet or network disruption, Toast’s offline POS capabilities provide essential continuity of operations. This capability allows customers to continue to place orders, print tickets and receipts, and take credit card payments. In this offline mode, all credit card information is securely encrypted and stored on the Toast device until it regains connection.
•Partner APIs. Toast has curated a portfolio of over 200 restaurant technology partners that utilize Toast APIs to deliver a broad range of specialized solutions.
Payments
Toast provides fast and secure, integrated payment processing through its POS devices, standalone contactless reader, or Toast Tap, and online ordering applications.
•Security and compliance. Toast is a PCI-DSS Level 1 service provider and PA-DSS validated payments application. All card processing systems adhere to strict PCI security policies and procedures.
•Reliability. We leverage our extensive on-the-ground experience to provide a reliable payments experience that is resilient to issues with restaurants’ networks or internet service providers as well as Toast’s own cloud platform.
•Flexible omni-channel capabilities. Toast provides in-store, digital, and partner payment capabilities. In-store payments through the Toast integrated card reader and Toast Tap support card dipping, tapping, and swiping as well as Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay, with fraud detection capabilities to minimize transaction risks. Using Toast-provided payments across channels simplifies our customers’ experience, providing them with a single daily deposit of funds and consolidated reporting for easier accounting.
Hardware
•User-friendly, durable, and designed to last. Our custom-designed hardware is pre-configured to enable self-installation with limited support and is created to be spill- and drop-proof with a long battery life to withstand the rigors of the restaurant environment.
•Device management. Our hardware utilizes the open-source Android mobile operating system which enables us to freely distribute the operating system to the Toast terminal and handheld devices. Proprietary management tools allow Toast to safely and efficiently upgrade POS software and device firmware as well as to monitor the health of devices across the fleet.
Our Growth Strategy
Our strategy is to continue to invest in areas that align with our customers’ needs. We expect that both we and our customers will continue to realize the value of our platform as we scale, make enhancements to our technology, offer more products and services, and help restaurants increase revenue while saving time and money. Toast both drives and benefits from the success of our customers—when restaurants grow, Toast grows through higher payments volume and increased adoption of our full platform.

•Fuel efficient location growth with both new and existing customers. Despite our rapid growth and scale, we estimate that our current locations account for less than 10% of restaurant locations in the United States. We expect the restaurant industry to continue to shift toward innovative, digital, cloud-based solutions as restaurants seek to leverage technology to drive more growth and operate more efficiently. We therefore believe there is a substantial opportunity to grow our location footprint. To that end, we intend to invest in our field-based go-to-market engine, customer success through a combination of tailored onboarding services, customer support, and intuitive product design, as well as research and development of new products to serve the evolving needs of restaurants and provide solutions that cater to all segments of the restaurant industry. We also expect to see continued location growth among our existing customers, both as they open new locations and as we continue to roll out the Toast platform to more of our customers’ existing locations. 
•Increase adoption of our full suite of products. We believe that we are well-positioned to sell additional products to our existing customers through a combination of sales and marketing efforts and product-led growth. We believe our all-in-one, integrated platform approach is well-suited to a customer base that has historically struggled to adopt technology at the same pace as other industries due to a lack of dedicated information technology resources.
•Invest in and expand our product platform. We intend to further invest in research and development to expand the functionality of our current platform and to broaden the subscription services and financial technology solutions we offer. We believe our proven track record and continued strategy to build products that directly address key pain points for our stakeholders will differentiate us and help grow our addressable market. We also believe we have an opportunity to expand the ways in which we leverage the data on our platform to help our customers succeed.
•Further develop our partner ecosystem. Toast’s integrated platform currently connects customers to over 200 partners, providing our customers with the tools and features they need to run their business. Today, we have partnerships in place across a spectrum of solutions that include employee management, reservations, inventory, accounting, security, analytics, marketing and customer relationship management, loyalty, mobile pay, gift cards, online ordering, and digital signage. We intend to continue expanding our technology and channel partnerships to deliver even more value to our customers and increase the strategic nature of our platform. 
•Selectively pursue inorganic growth. We intend to selectively explore inorganic product and technology growth opportunities to build out our portfolio and strengthen our ecosystem advantage. We believe that the scale of our partner ecosystem provides additional visibility into what products would be most valuable to our customers. For example, in July 2022, we announced the acquisition of Sling Inc., or Sling, to empower our customers to simplify scheduling and communication across their team, control their labor costs, and help increase employee satisfaction. 
•Expand internationally. We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand usage of our platform outside of the United States. This growth strategy is in the early stages and is a long-term initiative. We are in the process of building an international sales team and investing in targeted research and development efforts to address this market opportunity.
Customer Success
Our customer success team supports our customers through their entire lifecycle beginning with onboarding and extending to ongoing customer care, including product enablement and education around industry best practices. We invest in scalable and efficient onboarding solutions that offer a differentiated customer experience. We currently offer on-site, remote, and self-guided implementation options to our customers. To better serve the growing sophistication of our customers and improve the upfront cost burden, we launched a remote onboarding offering in 2019. 
We offer multi-channel customer support 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, 365 days per year via chat, phone, or web. We built our entire platform to be cloud-based, so our customer success team can provide seamless support remotely. Due to the all-in-one nature of our platform, we offer restaurants a single point of contact for any issues across their entire technology stack. We invest significantly in customer support and consider these investments to be a key competitive differentiator.
Sales and Marketing
The restaurant industry is a local industry. Restaurant operators purchase everything from food and alcohol to equipment and table linens from individuals that they know and trust. Our sales and marketing motion is designed from the ground up to integrate into this dynamic by combining a high-volume marketing engine with a localized and consultative sales force.
We start with in-market sales teams that are deeply familiar with, and trusted by, the local community. This deep knowledge of the local food and beverage scene provides us with a competitive advantage. Our sales team is organized by three main functional areas: an acquisition team that is focused on new location growth and organized by restaurant size (i.e., number of locations per customer), an upsell team that focuses on expansion into the install base, and a growth team focused on sales enablement and operations.
To generate and capture demand we invest heavily in the primary discovery channels for restaurant operators. We combine our demand generation efforts with pricing and packaging that is designed to increase platform adoption and simplify the buying process for restaurants. This approach provides multiple entry points into the Toast platform ranging from a single terminal point of sale to a multi-product setup for a complex restaurant.
As Toast continues to grow, so does the importance of brand recognition and our investments into strengthening it. This brand recognition will help continue to drive growth in the restaurant community and increase referrals.
Research and Development
Our product development strategy is based on typical inputs such as market and user research, strategy planning, and iterative financial analysis, but it is first and foremost based around our customer obsession and mission of empowering the restaurant community to delight guests, do what they love, and thrive. We believe strongly that this customer obsession and innovation on their behalf is the best long-term product strategy to help our customers outperform, and this strategy drives both the products we build and the partnerships we create within the restaurant ecosystem.
We organize our team with a full-stack development model, integrating product management, engineering, analytics, data science, and design. Our research and development teams are located in the United States, Europe, and India. Each location has a combination of product management, user experience design, software engineering, and quality assurance personnel. 
Competition
The market is competitive and evolving rapidly. Our platform combines functionality from numerous product categories, and we therefore compete with a range of providers, including cloud-based point of sale platforms, legacy point of sale platform payments solutions, and point technology providers with products addressing specific front of house or back of house operations. We compete on the basis of a number of factors including: 
•the ability to provide an all-in-one software and financial technology platform specifically designed to meet the existing and future technology needs of prospective customers, including comprehensive partner ecosystem integrations; 
•product performance, flexibility, durability, ease of use, security, scalability, and reliability; 
•brand recognition, reputation, and customer satisfaction; 
•the availability and quality of support and other professional services, including the ability to onboard prospective customers in a timely and cost-efficient manner; 
•the ability to operate and support all geographic markets specified by the prospective customer; and 
•the ability to integrate systems seamlessly and at low costs to provide important data insights.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors. Furthermore, we expect that our industry will continue to attract new market entrants, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new offerings. We may also expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets.
Seasonality
We experience seasonality in our financial technology solutions revenue, which is largely driven by the level of gross payment volume, or GPV, processed through our platform. For example, customers typically have greater sales during the warmer months, though this effect varies regionally. As a result, our financial technology solutions revenue per location has historically been stronger in the second and third quarters. We believe that financial technology solutions revenue from both existing and potential future products will continue to represent a significant proportion of our overall revenue mix, and seasonality will continue to impact our results of operations.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 4,500 employees worldwide. We also engage consultants as needed to support our business and operations from time to time.
Core to our success is our passionate and diverse team of Toasters, led by a skilled and experienced leadership team with a proven track record of scaling leading platforms and organizations. With approximately two-thirds of our employees having previous work experience in the restaurant industry, we are truly driven by a love for amazing food, a love for delightful experiences and a love for the diverse community that restaurants represent. Our Toast values guide our culture, and support a sense of belonging among Toasters. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be strong.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
At Toast, we power successful restaurants of all sizes. The restaurant industry is one of the most diverse industries and we embrace that diversity by encouraging it within our company. We believe that the success of our business comes only with the success of all our employees. 
We bake inclusive principles into our design, build cultural competence and equity in our practices, and ensure opportunities for growth and rewards by investing in developing our managers and employees through a number of live, in-person and self-directed programs.
We offer a number of specialized Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, or DEI, programs and initiatives to equip Toasters with the tools necessary to develop and promote an environment of inclusion and respect that leads to better engagement, productivity, and innovation. These include individual and peer DEI coaching focused on targeted conversations and specific development; DEI programs that build awareness and mitigate bias offered live and as e-learning modules; and specific development for our managers and leaders designed to enable them to build more meaningful and authentic relationships with their teams and create a more inclusive workplace environment. 
Our Toasters are directly involved in maintaining an inclusive and equitable culture through our Toast Communities and our Council of Advocates for Equity, which leverage their combined perspectives to advocate for an equitable experience for all, across our business strategy and company culture. 
Social Commitment
At Toast, we are committed to supporting causes that solve critical food issues and enrich the food experience for all. Driven by our commitment to local communities, in 2019 we launched a philanthropic branch, Toast.org, dedicated to solving critical food issues that impact communities across the United States. In furtherance of Toast’s values and these goals, we have joined the Pledge 1% movement. As a part of this initiative, in each of 2021 and 2022, we transferred 546,889 shares of Class A common stock, which represent our first two annual installments of the total 5,468,890 shares reserved by our Board of Directors as bona fide gifts to a charitable organization to fund our social impact initiatives through Toast.org.
We are also committed to minimizing our environmental footprint in an effort to mitigate climate change and began our efforts by conducting and disclosing our first greenhouse gas inventory in 2022. 
Compensation, Well-being and Safety
Toast is committed to supporting employee safety and well-being. We offer competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being, including healthcare, mental health support programs, and parental and family leave, as well as retirement savings and company match. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes to our operations and business practices to prioritize the safety of our Toasters and their families and to continue to deliver on our mission to help the restaurant industry thrive, including hybrid and remote working schedule accommodations, enhanced safety measures, and other tools and resources.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, a variety of contractual arrangements, such as license agreements, assignment agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality procedures and technical measures to gain rights to and protect the intellectual property used in our business. 
We have also developed a patent program and a strategy to identify, apply for, and secure patents for innovative aspects of our platform and technology. As of December 31, 2022, we have 50 U.S. patent applications allowed/granted, and in addition we have 17 U.S. patent applications pending. Our issued patents are estimated to expire between 2036 and 2039. Such expiration dates may vary based on a variety of factors, including benefit claims, term adjustments, and/or extensions as well as the timely payment of maintenance fees. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost effective. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and numerous pending trademark applications in U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.toasttab.com and other variations.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. See the sections titled “Risk Factors,” including the section(s) titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for a description of the risks related to our intellectual property.
Government Regulation
Various aspects of our business and service areas are subject to U.S. federal, state, and local regulation, as well as regulation outside the United States. As more fully described below, certain of our services also are, or may be in the future, subject to the laws, rules, and regulations that are related to acceptance of credit cards and debit cards, payments services (such as payment processing and settlement services), including laws concerning consumer financial protection, anti-money laundering and escheatment. From time to time, we may launch pilot programs or early-stage products, which may subject us to additional state or federal laws or regulations. We also are, or may be in the future, subject to rules promulgated and enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States, including federal, state and local agencies, payment card networks and other authorities, and internationally. These descriptions are not exhaustive, and these laws, regulations, and rules frequently change and are increasing in number.
BSA and FinCEN Regulation
Certain of our payment technology solutions are or may become subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, or the BSA. The BSA requires certain financial institutions, including banks and money services business, or MSBs (such as money transmitters), to register with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, as MSBs and to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records, among other things.
Our subsidiary, Toast Processing Services LLC, or TPS, is registered as an MSB with FinCEN in its capacity as a money transmitter. As an MSB, we are required to maintain a written anti-money laundering program, or AML Program, that meets the standards set forth in the FinCEN regulations implementing the BSA. In addition, our AML Program is designed to address and comply with the Money Laundering Control Act and other U.S. laws and regulations regarding anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, which we refer to as AML/CFT, and to control for the AML/CFT risks inherent to our business. The AML Program is also designed to prevent our platform from being used to facilitate business with certain individuals, entities, countries, and territories that are targets of economic or trade sanctions, including those imposed by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.
State Licensing Requirements
Certain of our payment technology solutions are or may become subject to state money transmitter or payroll processor laws and regulations. TPS is licensed as a money transmitter in most states and is seeking licenses to operate as a money transmitter in connection with its payroll processing activities in certain other states. Federal and state money transmitter laws and regulations impose a variety of requirements and restrictions on us, including anti-money laundering program requirements; record-keeping requirements; disclosure requirements; examination requirements; annual or biennial activity reporting and license renewal requirements; notification and approval requirements for changes in our officers, directors, stock ownership or corporate control; permissible investment requirements; capital or minimum net worth requirements; bonding; restrictions on marketing and advertising; qualified individual requirements; anti-money laundering and compliance program requirements; data security and privacy requirements; and review requirements for customer-facing documents.
Additionally, states impose a variety of licensing requirements on entities engaged in certain insurance related activities. Our subsidiary, Toast Insurance Services, Inc., has obtained certain insurance related licenses from a majority of the 50 states plus Washington, D.C. As a result, we are currently subject to a variety of, and may in the future become subject to additional or newly enacted, state insurance laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. 
Card Network and NACHA Rules
We rely on our relationships with financial institutions and third-party payment processors to access the payment card networks, such as Visa and Mastercard, which enable our acceptance of credit cards and debit cards, and our ability to explore and offer certain other products. We pay fees to such financial institutions and third-party payment processors for such services. We are required by these third-party payment processors to register with Visa, Mastercard, and other card networks and to comply with the rules and the requirements of these card networks’ self-regulatory organizations. The payment networks and their member financial institutions routinely update, generally expand, and modify requirements applicable to our customers, including rules regulating data integrity, third-party relationships, merchant chargeback standards and compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS. PCI DSS is a set of requirements designed to ensure that all companies that process, store, or transmit payment card information maintain a secure environment to protect cardholder data.
We are also subject to the operating rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or NACHA. NACHA is a self-regulatory organization which administers and facilitates private-sector operating rules for ACH payments and defines the roles and responsibilities of financial institutions and other ACH network participants. The NACHA Rules and Operating Guidelines impose obligations on us and our partner financial institutions, such as audit and oversight by the financial institutions and the imposition of mandatory corrective action, including termination, for serious violations.
State Loan Disclosure Requirements and Other Substantive Lending Regulations
Loans facilitated by Toast Capital are subject to state laws and regulations that impose requirements related to commercial loans, including loan disclosures and terms, credit discrimination, and credit reporting. State advertising, loan brokering, loan servicing, and debt collection laws may apply to the marketing and loan administration services we provide to our bank partner that makes the loans facilitated by Toast Capital.
FTC Act and Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices
Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTC Act, prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, enforces Section 5 of the FTC Act against non-banks and has a history of pursuing enforcement actions for alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with the marketing or servicing of financial products and services that are marketed to consumers or small businesses. The FTC has jurisdiction over us and our business practices.
Payroll Card and On-Demand Pay Regulations
Together with our bank partner, we offer a payroll card, which allows the restaurant’s employees to receive wages, tips, and other compensation from their employers. These debit cards are subject to federal and state financial services laws, as well as the payment card network rules and NACHA rules. The Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulation, Regulation II, limit the amount of interchange revenue that the bank partner may receive, and share with us, on transactions made using these cards.
Payroll cards are subject to additional consumer financial regulation under federal law and state law. For example, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, and its implementing regulation, Regulation E, impose requirements on payroll cards, including requirements related to consumers’ rights and liabilities, treatment of funds on lost or stolen cards, error resolution and investigation, upfront fee disclosures, and access to account information. Additionally, state employment and payroll regulations impose regulations on the use of payroll cards to disburse wages and other compensation.
Further, proposals to adopt or change the statutes or regulations affecting on-demand pay services, such as PayOut, may periodically be promulgated by federal or state legislatures and government agencies. If enacted, those proposals could affect PayOut’s operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. These proposals may impact our ability to offer PayOut in a particular jurisdiction, or at all.
Stored Value Services
Stored value cards, gift cards and electronic gift certificates may trigger various federal and state laws and regulations. The customers who utilize our gift card processing products and services may be subject to these laws and regulations, which may include the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009.
Privacy and Consumer Information Security
In the ordinary course of our business, we access, collect, store, use, transmit and otherwise process certain types of data, including personal information, which subjects us to certain federal and state privacy and information security laws, rules, industry standards and regulations designed to regulate consumer information and data privacy, security and protection, and mitigate identity theft. These laws, some of which are discussed below, impose obligations with respect to the collection, processing, storage, disposal, use, transfer, retention and disclosure of personal information, and, with limited exceptions, give consumers the right to prevent use of their personal information and disclosure of it to third parties. Such laws and regulations are subject to ongoing changes, and a number of new proposed or recently-passed laws or regulations in this area are expected to be applicable to our business.
In addition, under these laws and regulations, including the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, and Regulation P promulgated thereunder, we must disclose our privacy policy and practices, including those policies relating to the sharing of nonpublic personal information with third parties. The GLBA may restrict the purposes for which we may use personal information obtained from consumers and third parties. We may also be required to provide an opt-out from certain sharing.
Since the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, took effect on January 1, 2020, our California business operations have been directly impacted in addition to an indirect impact on our operations nationwide. Subsequently, on January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, an amendment to the CCPA, took effect along with the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, or the VCDPA. Additional US state-specific laws in Colorado, Connecticut and Utah will also become effective in 2023. While personal information that we process that is subject to the GLBA is exempt from the CCPA and many of these other state laws, the CCPA, the VCDPA and these additional state laws will regulate other personal information that we collect and process and impose new consumer rights and limitations around personal information. 
Additionally, as we grow our business internationally, international privacy legislation such as the European General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, the United Kingdom GDPR (and other local legislation) and Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act along with provincial legislation will similarly impact our operations.
