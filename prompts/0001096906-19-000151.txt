Our Business
 
Company Background and History
    Alpine 4 Technologies Ltd. (“Alpine 4,” the “Company,” “we,” or “our”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 22, 2014.  The Company was formed to serve as a vehicle to effect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock, or other business combination with a domestic or foreign business.  As of the date this Report was filed, the Company was a holding company that owned five operating subsidiaries: ALTIA, LLC; Quality Circuit Assembly, Inc.; American Precision Fabricators, Inc.; Morris Sheet Metal, Corp; and JTD Spiral, Inc. (As discussed in more detail below, we previously had an additional subsidiary, Venture West Energy Services (formerly Horizon Well Testing, LLC). However, as of December 31, 2018, we discontinued operations on this company and in February 2019 filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

Who We Are

 Alpine 4 is a publicly held enterprise with four principles at the core of its business: Synergy, Innovation, Drive, and Excellence (S.I.D.E.).  At Alpine 4, we believe synergistic innovation drives excellence. By anchoring these words to our combined experience and capabilities, we are able to aggressively pursue opportunities within and across vertical markets. We deliver solutions that not only drive industry standards, but also increase value for our shareholders.
Driver, Stabilizer, Facilitator (DSF)
 
At the heart of our acquisition model is our focus on what we call DSF, which stands for Driver, Stabilizer, Facilitator.

 Driver are companies that are in emerging markets or technologies, have large upside potential for revenue and profits, and a large market opportunity to access.  These types of acquisitions are typically small, brand new companies that need structure that can support their growth.
 
Stabilizers are companies that have returning or “sticky” customers and consistent revenue, and that can provide solid net profit returns to Alpine 4.
 
Facilitators are our “secret sauce.”  We believe that our greatest competitive advantage is our highly diversified business structure combined with a collaborative business culture that helps drive out competition in our markets by bringing resources, planning, technology and capacity that our competitors do not have.
 
The following diagram shows how we view our various subsidiaries as drivers, facilitators, and stabilizers:
 




 At Alpine 4, we understand how technology and innovation can accentuate a business. We strive to develop strategic synergies between our holdings to create value and operational excellence within a unique long-term perspective.

Our Strategy
 
Alpine 4’s strategy is to provide Fortune 500-level execution strategies in its subsidiary companies and market segments to businesses and companies that have the most to benefit from this access.
 
Alpine 4 feels this opportunity exists in smaller middle market operating companies with revenues between $5 and $150 million.  In this target rich environment, we believe that businesses generally sell at more reasonable multiples, presenting greater opportunities for operational and strategic improvements and have greater potential for growth.   Implementation of our strategy within our holdings is accomplished by the offering of strategic and tactical MBA-level training and development, delivered via the following modules:

• | An Alpine 4 developed ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning system) and collaboration system called SPECTRUMebos. SPECTRUMebos is an Enterprise Business Operating System (ebos). This system will combine the key technology software components of Accounting and Financial Reporting, an Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP), a Document Management System (DMS), a Business Intelligence (BI) platform and a Customer Resource Management (CRM) hub which will be tethered to management reporting and collaboration toolsets. Management believes that these tools will help drive real-time information in two directions: first, to the front lines by empowering customer-facing stakeholders; and second, back to management for planning, problem solving, and integration. Management believes that SPECTRUMebos will be the technology “secret sauce” in managing our portfolio of companies and, in time, may be offered to external customers. 

Diversification
 
It is our goal to help drive Alpine 4 into a leading, multi-faceted holding company with diverse products and services that not only benefit from one another as whole but also have the benefit of independence.  This type of corporate structure is about having our subsidiaries prosper through strong onsite leadership, while working synergistically with other Alpine 4 holdings.   Alpine 4 has been set up with a holding company model, with Presidents who will run each subsidiary business, and Managers with specific industry related experience who, along with Kent Wilson, the CEO of Alpine 4, will help guide our portfolio of companies as needed.  Alpine 4 will work with our Presidents and Managers to ensure that our core principles of Synergy, Innovation, Drive, Excellence are implemented and internalized.  Further, we plan to work with our subsidiaries and capital partners to provide the proper capital allocation and to work to make sure each business is executing at high levels. 
 
In 2016, we saw the beginning of our plan for diversification take hold with the acquisition of Quality Circuit Assembly, Inc. (“QCA”), when Alpine 4 acquired 100% of QCA’s stock effective April 1, 2016.  Additional information relating to our acquisition of QCA can be found in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016.
 
In October 2016, Alpine 4 formed a new Limited Liability Company called ALTIA (Automotive Logic & Technology In Action) to create an independent subsidiary for Alpine 4’s 6th Sense Auto product and its BrakeActive product.
 
  Effective, January 1, 2017, Alpine 4 acquired 100% of Venture West Energy Services (“VWES”) (formerly Horizon Well Testing, LLC). Additional information about the acquisition of VWES can be found below under “Recent Developments” and in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 8, 2016, and January 13, 2017.  Due to many different circumstances but primarily from the effects of the theft event that occurred in April 2017 on December 31, 2018, we discontinued operations on this company and will begin the liquidation of the VWES assets.  In February 2019, VWES filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.


In April 2018, Alpine 4 acquired 100% of American Precision Fabricators (APF) Additional information relating to our acquisition of APF can be found in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on April 10th 2018.
 
At the core of our business strategy is our focus on scalable corporate platform solutions.  We have built a strong portfolio of manufacturing, software, and energy driven businesses with a focus on long-term value creation.
