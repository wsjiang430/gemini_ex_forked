Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company with research and development programs broadly falling into two categories: (i) new chemical entities derived from our Epigenetic Regulator Program, in which we attempt to discover and develop molecules which have not previously been approved and marketed as therapeutics, and (ii) proprietary pharmaceutical programs, in which we apply our formulation expertise and technologies largely to active pharmaceutical ingredients whose safety and efficacy have previously been established but which we aim to improve in some manner through a new formulation. We also manufacture and sell osmotic pumps used in laboratory research and design, and develop and manufacture a wide range of standard and custom biodegradable polymers and excipients for pharmaceutical and medical device clients for use as raw materials in their products.
 Our product pipeline currently consists of multiple investigational drug candidates in development.  DUR‑928, a new chemical entity in Phase 1 and 2 development, is the lead candidate in DURECT’s Epigenetic Regulator Program.  An endogenous, orally bioavailable small molecule, DUR-928 has been shown in preclinical studies to play an important regulatory role in lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and cell survival.  Human applications may include chronic metabolic diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and other liver diseases, inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and acute organ injury such as alcoholic hepatitis (AH) and acute kidney injury (AKI).  DURECT’s proprietary oral and injectable delivery technologies are designed to enable new indications and enhanced attributes for small-molecule and biologic drugs.  One late-stage development program in this category is POSIMIR® (bupivacaine extended-release solution), an investigational analgesic product intended to deliver bupivacaine to provide up to 3 days of pain relief after surgery.
 As a result of the assignment of certain patent rights, DURECT will receive single digit sales-based earn-out payments from U.S. net sales of Indivior’s PERSERIS™ (risperidone) drug for schizophrenia, which was approved in July 2018.  Indivior has indicated that it commenced the full commercial launch of PERSERIS in February 2019 and that it expects peak year net revenues to be $200-300 million.  In addition, in September 2018, our licensee, Orient Pharma informed us that it had obtained marketing authorization for Methydur Sustained Release Capsules from the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan.  Methydur Sustained Release Capsules use our ORADUR® technology and are indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Taiwan. Orient Pharma also has stated that it expects to make Methydur Sustained Release Capsules commercially available in Taiwan in 2019, while seeking a partner in China and pursuing regulatory approvals in selected other countries where it has commercialization rights and a commercialization presence. We will receive a single digit royalty on sales of Methydur Sustained Release Capsules by Orient Pharma and retain rights to this product in North America, Europe, Japan and all other countries not specifically licensed to Orient Pharma.
A central aspect of our business strategy involves advancing multiple product candidates at one time, which is enabled by leveraging our resources with those of corporate collaborators. Thus, certain of our programs are currently licensed to corporate collaborators on terms which typically call for our collaborator to fund all or a substantial portion of future development costs and then pay us milestone payments based on specific development or commercial achievements plus royalties on product sales. At the same time, we have retained the rights to other programs, which are the basis of potential future collaborations and which over time may provide a pathway for us to develop our own commercial, sales and marketing organization.

Epigenetic Regulator Program and New Chemical Entities
 Epigenetic regulation does not involve changes of the DNA sequence itself, but instead involve biochemical modification of either the DNA itself or of proteins that intimately associate with DNA as the key mediators of cellular function.  These modifications facilitate the appropriate downstream biological effects through changes in gene expression.  
 DURECT’s Epigenetic Regulator Program involves a multi-year collaborative effort with the Department of Internal Medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), the VCU Medical Center and the McGuire VA Medical Center. The knowledge base supporting this program is a result of more than 30 years of lipid research by Shunlin Ren, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Internal Medicine at the VCU Medical Center and a recipient of multiple grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other agencies for metabolic disease research. During the course of this program, a number of endogenous and synthetic compounds have been discovered that may have therapeutic utility for various diseases, disorders or syndromes. The lead compound from this program, DUR-928, is an endogenous, orally available small molecule that modulates the activity of various nuclear receptors that play important regulatory roles in lipid homeostasis, inflammation and cell survival.  Under a license with Virginia Commonwealth University, we hold the exclusive worldwide right to develop and commercialize DUR-928 and related molecules discovered in the program.
 The biological activity of DUR-928 has been demonstrated in over a dozen different animal disease models involving three animal species. Several of these disease models represent chronic metabolic disorders of hepatic lipid accumulation and dysfunction (e.g., NAFLD and NASH) and several represent acute organ injuries (e.g., endotoxin shock, acute oxidative damage, ischemic-reperfusion kidney injury, and stroke models).
 Our major product research and development efforts planned for DUR-928 in 2019 are set forth in the following table:

In pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies conducted in mice, hamsters, rats, rabbits, dogs and monkeys, DUR-928 has been found to be orally available, locally tolerable and safe at all doses and in all routes of administration tested to date. These non-clinical results support the use of DUR-928 in the completed, ongoing and planned human safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and proof-of-concept trials

 Chronic Liver Disease Program with Orally Administered DUR-928
 Market Opportunity.   Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of chronic liver disease in both children and adults. It is estimated that NAFLD affects about 20% to 30% of adults and 10% of children in the United States. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a more severe and progressive form of 
 2

NAFLD, is one of the most common chronic liver diseases worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of more than 10% of adults in the United States, Europe, Japan and other developed countries. No drug is currently approved for NAFLD or NASH.  Moreover, alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) and its more advanced stage, alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), develops in approximately 90% of individuals who drink more than 60 grams/day of alcohol, but may occur in individuals who drink less, and is a major contributor to the global burden of liver cirrhosis. In addition to these liver diseases, there are a number of orphan liver diseases for which we may seek to develop DUR-928.
 Clinical Program.    In January 2019 we announced plans to accelerate the start of a new DUR-928 Phase 1b trial in NASH patients and expect to begin enrolling patients in the first quarter of 2019. This will be a randomized and open-label study conducted in the U.S. to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics and signals of biological activity of DUR-928.  Three doses of DUR-928 (low, middle and high) will be administered orally for 28 consecutive days with approximately 20 patients per dose group for a total of approximately 60 patients in the trial. We expect to begin enrolling patients during the first quarter of 2019 and announce initial data from this study in the second half of 2019.  
 DURECT has completed multiple single-site Phase I trials in healthy subjects with orally administered DUR-928. One of the studies was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single-ascending-dose study that evaluated the safety, tolerability and PK of DUR-928. The 30-subject study evaluated DUR-928 in five cohorts of healthy volunteers receiving DUR-928 (n=20 on drug, 10 on placebo) at escalating doses that resulted in peak plasma concentrations greater than 100-fold higher than endogenous levels. DUR-928 was well-tolerated at all dose levels, with no serious treatment-related adverse events reported. Dose related increases in plasma concentrations were observed with peak plasma concentration at approximately 2-6 hours after dosing. We subsequently conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending-dose study in 20 healthy subjects (n=16 on drug, 4 on placebo).  Following multiple dosing, DUR-928 was well-tolerated at all doses, with no serious drug-related adverse events reported and no accumulation in plasma concentrations observed with repeat dosing.  We also conducted a food effect study with 8 healthy subjects and observed no food effect on DUR-928 absorption. 
 We also conducted a Phase 1b trial in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic NASH patients and matched control subjects (MCS) (matched by age, body mass index and gender with normal liver function) utilizing orally administered DUR-928. This was an open-label, single-ascending-dose safety and PK study conducted in Australia in two successive dose cohorts (first a low dose of 50 mg and then a high dose of 200 mg). Both cohorts consisted of 10 NASH patients and 6 MCS. Data from this study was presented at the International Liver Congress™ 2017 organized by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in Amsterdam on April 22, 2017. All patients and MCS in this study tolerated DUR-928 well.  One patient (with a prior history of arrhythmia and an ongoing viral infection) in the high dose cohort experienced a serious adverse event (shortness of breath), which occurred without unusually abnormal biochemical changes and resolved without intervention but was considered possibly treatment related by the physician due to its temporal association with dosing.  In both the low and high dose cohorts, the PK parameters were comparable between the NASH patients and the MCS.  In addition, the systemic exposure following the low and high doses of DUR-928 was dose dependent.
 While this study was not designed to assess efficacy, we observed significant reductions from baseline of several biomarkers after both doses of DUR-928.   A single oral dose of DUR-928 statistically significantly reduced the levels of both full-length and cleaved cytokeratin-18 (CK-18), bilirubin, hsCRP, and IL-18 in these subjects.  The mean decrease of full-length CK-18 (a generalized cell death marker) at the measured time point of greatest effect (12 hours after dosing) was 33% in the low dose cohort and 41% in the high dose cohort.  The mean decrease of cleaved CK-18 (a cell apoptosis marker) at the measured time point of greatest effect (12 hours after dosing) was 37% in the low dose cohort and 47% in the high dose cohort.  The mean reduction of total bilirubin (a liver function marker) at the measured time point of greatest effect (12 hours after dosing) was 27% in the low dose cohort and 31% in the high dose cohort.  The mean decrease of high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) (a marker of inflammation) at the measured time point of greatest effect (24 hours after dosing) was 8% in the low dose cohort and 13% in the high dose cohort.   The mean decrease of IL-18 (an inflammatory mediator) at the measured time point of greatest effect (8 hours after dosing) was 4% in the low dose cohort and 8% in the high dose cohort.
 Collectively, the reduction of these biomarkers plus results from our animal and cell culture studies suggest potential therapeutic activity of DUR-928 for patients with liver diseases.  However, additional studies are required to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DUR-928, and there is no assurance that these biomarker effects will be 
 3

associated with clinically relevant benefits, or that DUR-928 will demonstrate safety or efficacy in treating liver diseases in future controlled trials.  
 In 2018, we began conducting a Phase 2a trial in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with orally administered DUR-928.  This Phase 2a trial was designed to be a randomized, open label study with a low dose cohort and a high dose cohort, in which patients (n = 15-20 per cohort) would receive daily oral dosing of DUR-928 for 4-weeks with follow-up for an additional four-weeks. The objectives of this study included safety, PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) markers, including the percent change from baseline of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and other biomarkers.   Since the initiation of the study, we dosed five PSC patients, and in January 2019 we decided to discontinue the trial primarily due to the slow enrollment rate and a desire to focus resources on other indications.  
 Acute Organ Injury Program with Injectable DUR-928
 Market Opportunity.    Acute organ injury is another area of major unmet medical need for which effective pharmaceutical treatment is often lacking. Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a syndrome characterized by progressive inflammatory liver injury associated with long-term heavy intake of alcohol, and involves a spectrum that ranges from mild injury to severe, life threatening injury.  Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is an acute, inflammatory form of ALD for which there are no effective therapeutics available. The prevalence of AH is believed to be 10-35% of heavy drinkers.  There were over 320,000 hospitalizations related to alcoholic hepatitis in 2010, and the hospitalization costs amounted to nearly $50,000 per patient. Acute kidney injury (AKI), a sudden loss of kidney function due to renal failure or injury, affects approximately 2.8 million patients per year in the United States and is associated with increased mortality, prolonged hospital stays, kidney dialysis and progression to chronic kidney disease. There are various forms of acute organ injury affecting the liver, the kidney or other organs for which we may seek to develop DUR-928.
 Clinical Program.     The initial Phase 1 trial in healthy subjects was a single-site, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single-ascending-dose study that evaluated the safety, tolerability and PK of intramuscular (IM) injected DUR-928. The 24-subject study (16 healthy volunteers on the drug and 8 on placebo) of four escalating dose levels resulted in dose proportional systemic exposure of DUR-928 with peak plasma concentrations greater than 1000-fold higher than endogenous levels. DUR-928 was well-tolerated at all dose levels, with no serious treatment-related adverse events reported. We also conducted a multiple-dose study involving 10 healthy subjects, in which participants received IM-injected DUR-928 for 5 consecutive days (8 subjects on the drug, 2 on placebo) using the next to highest dose from the single dose study. No serious treatment related adverse events were reported, no subjects withdrew from the study, no accumulation in plasma concentrations were observed with repeat dosing, and the pain scores and injection site reactions were minimal. We also conducted a single-ascending dose intravenous infusion (IV) study with 16 healthy subjects and observed no treatment-related serious adverse events. The systemic exposure following IV infusion was dose proportional. 
 A Phase 1 drug-drug interaction study conducted in healthy subjects demonstrated that neither orally administered nor intravenously injected DUR-928 at doses tested affected the safety and PK of midazolam, a drug metabolized by CYP3A4, which is one of the important enzymes associated with clinically relevant drug-drug interactions.
 We have also conducted a Phase 1b study with injected DUR-928 in patients with impaired kidney function (stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD)) and matched control subjects (MCS), matched by age, body mass and gender with normal kidney function. This study was a single-site, open-label, single-ascending-dose study. in two successive cohorts (first a low dose of 30 mg and then a high dose of 120 mg) evaluating safety and PK of intramuscular injected DUR-928. The low dose cohort consisted of 6 patients with CKD and 3 MCS; the high dose cohort consisted of 5 CKD patients and 3 MCS.  In this trial, DUR-928 was well tolerated among all subjects and the PK parameters between the kidney function impaired patients and the MCS were comparable. While the number of subjects involved was small and not designed to assess efficacy, we did observe decreases in bilirubin and CK-18 when those levels were elevated at baseline, although the results were not statistically significant. The results of this Phase 1b trial were presented at Kidney Week 2018 in San Diego, CA.
 In 2018, we began conducting a Phase 2a clinical trial with intravenously infused DUR-928 in patients with moderate and severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH).  This is an open label, dose escalation, multi-center U.S. study, originally designed to be conducted in two sequential parts.  Part A includes patients with moderate AH (as determined by the Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores, a common scoring system to assess the 
 4

severity and prognosis of AH patients), and Part B includes patients with severe AH.  Three dose levels (30, 90 and 150 mg) were planned for testing in Part A. Dose escalation may occur following review of safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) results of the prior dose level by a Dose Escalation Committee (DEC). The target number of patients for the study was 4 per dose group. The objectives of this study include assessment of safety, PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) signals, including liver biochemistry and biomarkers. After completing dosing for the low-dose 30 mg cohort (n=4) of Part A (moderate AH patients), the DEC approved commencement of the 90 mg cohort in Part A while simultaneously commencing recruitment for Part B (severe AH patients) with the 30 mg dose.  In January 2019 we announced that two severe AH patients had been treated and that after completing the 30 mg dose group in Part B, we plan to transition the study to Dr. Craig McClain at the University of Louisville, who was recently awarded an NIH grant to study DUR-928 in AH patients. We have now completed dosing of the 30 mg cohort (n=4) of Part B, the enrollment of which was much more rapid than Part A. After reviewing the safety and PK data, the DEC has approved commencement of the 90 mg cohort in Part B. Based on the encouraging data from both the moderate and severe 30 mg cohorts, the relatively rapid enrollment of severe AH patients, and strong encouragement from several of our key expert advisors and clinical trial investigators, we have decided to continue our trial by conducting the next cohort of severe AH patients at the 90 mg dose. In parallel with our recruitment of patient for both of the 90 mg cohorts in our trial, we are supporting Dr. Craig McClain’s efforts to initiate his NIH-funded study at the University of Louisville.
 Skin Inflammatory Disorder Program with Topical DUR-928
 Market opportunity.  Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease and an immune-mediated condition that causes the body to make new skin cells in days rather than weeks.  In the United States, there are about 150,000 new cases of psoriasis every year and it affects more than 8 million Americans.  According to the International Federation of Psoriasis Associations (IFPA), nearly 3% of the world’s population has some form of psoriasis or about 125 million people. Psoriasis causes itchiness and irritation and may be painful. There is no cure for psoriasis, but treatment can ease symptoms. 
 Approximately 80% of patients with psoriasis have localized disease. Topical agents remain the mainstay of localized psoriasis treatment. Other inflammatory skin disorders, such as atopic dermatitis, which affects approximately 32 million Americans, represent significant unmet medical needs. Most currently available topical treatments, typically as first line therapy, either slow down excessive skin cell proliferation or reduce inflammation.  
 Clinical program.  We have conducted an exploratory Phase 1b trial in psoriasis patients (9 evaluable patients) in Australia.  The double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial was conducted using a micro-plaque assay with intralesional injections of DUR-928.  We feel that the results were encouraging and warrant further investigation.  As a result, we are conducting a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled proof-of-concept clinical trial, in which DUR-928 will be applied topically once-daily for 28 days in patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. The trial will be conducted at multiple clinical sites in the U.S.  Twenty patients are planned to be enrolled to obtain approximately 15 evaluable patients. Patients will serve as their own controls, applying DUR-928 to the plaque on one arm and the vehicle (placebo) to a similar plaque on the other arm. After the treatment period, patients will be followed for an additional four weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint will be change in local psoriasis scores from baseline in the DUR-928-treated plaques compared to that in the vehicle-treated plaques. We expect to begin enrolling patients during the first quarter of 2019 and announce top-line data from this study in the second half of 2019.

Additional Proprietary Pharmaceutical Programs

    POSIMIR (bupivacaine extended-release solution)
 Our post-operative pain relief depot, POSIMIR, is a sustained release injectable using our SABER® delivery system to deliver bupivacaine, an off-patent pharmaceutical agent. SABER is a controlled drug delivery technology that is administered via the parenteral (i.e., injectable) route to deliver drugs that act systemically or locally. POSIMIR is designed to be administered to a surgical site at the end of surgery for post-operative pain relief and is intended to provide local analgesia for up to 3 days, which we believe coincides with the time period of the greatest need for post-surgical pain control in most patients.
 Status. In April 2013, we submitted an NDA as a 505(b)(2) application, which relied in part on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness of a reference drug. In February 2014, we received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA. Based on the CRL and subsequent communications with the FDA, we conducted a new POSIMIR Phase 3 clinical trial (referred to as the PERSIST trial) consisting of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) surgery to further evaluate the benefits and risks of POSIMIR. We began recruiting patients for this trial in November 2015 comparing POSIMIR to placebo. Based on advice from the FDA received subsequent to the start of the trial, in April 2016 we amended the PERSIST trial. Starting in August 2016, we began implementing the amended trial (referred to as Part 2 of the PERSIST trial) to evaluate POSIMIR against standard bupivacaine HCl rather than placebo as we had been doing initially in the study. In October 2017, we reported that the PERSIST trial did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of reduction in pain on movement over the first 48 hours after surgery as compared to standard bupivacaine HCl.   While results trended in favor of POSIMIR versus the comparator, they did not achieve statistical significance. 
 In total, we have completed 16 clinical studies with POSIMIR, in seven different surgical procedures, including inguinal hernia repair, shoulder surgery (primarily subacromial decompression), appendectomy, abdominal hysterectomy, open laparotomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and laparoscopic colectomy. The incision lengths treated ranged from a few centimeters for laparoscopic portals, to open laparotomy incisions of up to 35 cm. The seriousness of the surgery ranged from day surgery hernia repair in relatively healthy patients to major abdominal surgery for colon cancer in elderly patients with substantial co-morbidity who were often hospitalized for a week or more. The safety experience from this variety of procedures and patients was designed to allow for extrapolation of the safety and efficacy data to a broad surgical population. Our POSIMIR clinical development program has been devised to establish the safety and efficacy of POSIMIR for the treatment of post-surgical pain for 3 days.

Efficacy
 We believe that two of the completed clinical trials support the efficacy of POSIMIR in post-operative pain and meet the requirements to be considered as adequate and well-controlled pivotal clinical trials:
 Hernia pivotal efficacy trial
 The hernia pivotal efficacy clinical trial was designed to evaluate the tolerability, activity, dose response and pharmacokinetics of POSIMIR in patients undergoing open inguinal hernia repair. The trial was conducted in Australia and New Zealand as a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study in 122 patients. Study patients were randomized into three treatment groups: patients that were treated with POSIMIR 2.5 mL (n=43), POSIMIR 5 mL (n=47) and SABER placebo (n=32). The co-primary efficacy endpoints for the study were Mean Pain Intensity on Movement area under the curve (AUC), a measure of pain over a period of 1-72 hours post-surgery, and the proportion of patients requiring supplemental opioid analgesic medication during the study (defined as 0-15 days).
 In relation to the co-primary endpoint of pain reduction as measured by Mean Pain Intensity on Movement AUC 1-72 hours post-surgery, the patient group treated with POSIMIR 5 mL reported thirty-one percent (31%) less pain versus placebo, and the result was statistically significant (p=0.0031). Fifty-three percent (53%) of the study patients in the POSIMIR 5 mL group took supplemental opioid analgesic medications versus seventy-two percent (72%) of the placebo patients (p=0.0909). Although this positive trend for this co-primary endpoint in favor of the POSIMIR 5 mL group was not statistically significant, both secondary endpoints measuring opioid analgesic medication consumption were met at a statistically significant level. During the periods of 1-24 hours, 24-48 hours and 48-72 hours after surgery, placebo patients consumed approximately 3.5 (p=0.0009), 2.9 (p=0.0190) and 3.6 (p=0.0172) times more supplemental opioid analgesic medications (mean total daily consumption of opioid analgesic medication in morphine equivalents), respectively, than the POSIMIR 5 mL treatment group. The median decrease in supplemental opioid analgesics taken over the first three days after surgery was 80% (p=0.0085) for the POSIMIR 5 mL group as compared to the placebo group.
 Shoulder pivotal efficacy trial
 The shoulder pivotal efficacy trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response trial conducted at 9 investigational centers in Europe. In this study, 107 patients were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups prior to undergoing elective arthroscopic shoulder surgery: POSIMIR 5 mL (n=53), SABER-Placebo (n=25) or bupivacaine HCl solution (n=29). All patients were given a background pain treatment consisting of a daily dose of two or four grams (depending on the patient’s weight) of paracetamol (acetaminophen). In addition, each patient was provided supplemental opioid rescue medication, if needed. With respect to efficacy, the primary endpoints of the study were to demonstrate: (1) an improvement in terms of pain intensity on movement area under the curve (AUC) during the period 1–72 hours post-surgery, and (2) a decrease in the total use of opioid rescue analgesia 0–72 hours post-surgery.
 Results from this study demonstrate that the POSIMIR group experienced a statistically significant reduction in pain intensity of approximately 20% (p=0.012) versus SABER-Placebo. Applying the appropriate statistical test given the data distribution, the POSIMIR group showed a statistically significant reduction of approximately 67% (p=0.013) in median opioid use in favor of POSIMIR. No statistical differences were found when POSIMIR was compared to bupivacaine HCl.
 Safety
 Bupivacaine is a well-known drug with an extensive understanding of its risks and benefits. DURECT has completed 16 clinical trials involving POSIMIR. A total of 1463 patients participated in these trials, 1144 of whom were exposed to POSIMIR or SABER-Placebo in volumes ranging from 2.5 to 10 mL. A total of 876 patients were exposed to POSIMIR with the dose of bupivacaine ranging from 330 to 990 mg. Our planned commercial dose is 5 mL (660 mg). In addition, a total of 272 patients were treated with bupivacaine HCl in control groups and 268 patients received SABER-Placebo in control groups.
 7

Overall, the POSIMIR patient groups showed a similar systemic safety profile as the patient groups treated with SABER-Placebo and bupivacaine HCl. Local site reactions were observed more frequently in the POSIMIR and SABER-Placebo groups than in the active comparator groups, most frequently in abdominal surgeries; most of these observations were discolorations (e.g., surgical bruising), the majority of which resolved without treatment during the observation period. There was little difference in the incidence of severe or serious adverse events between the POSIMIR, SABER-Placebo and bupivacaine HCl treatment groups. Most of the serious adverse events seen in these trials appear to be due to complications of surgery, anesthesia, analgesics, or co-morbidity and not POSIMIR-related. The clinical history for serious adverse events has been reviewed and we do not believe POSIMIR was associated with any bupivacaine toxicity. The adverse event data was analyzed in a variety of ways to detect any evidence of bupivacaine central nervous system or cardiac toxicity or other unexpected effects. No patients treated with POSIMIR had an instance of a severe central nervous system or cardiac adverse event traditionally associated with bupivacaine toxicity.
 Plans for FDA Submission
 After carefully reviewing the existing POSIMIR data and evaluating the feedback we have received from the FDA, including the CRL and other correspondence, we have made the decision to prepare and submit to FDA a response to the CRL. The submission will request FDA approval of POSIMIR based on what the Company and its advisors believe is adequate evidence of both safety and efficacy. As the submission is intended to be a response to a CRL, we expect a 6-month FDA review period.
 Market Opportunity.    According to data published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, there are approximately 72 million ambulatory and inpatient surgical procedures performed annually in the U.S. Insufficient postoperative pain control remains a significant problem, with studies indicating that roughly 65% of patients experience moderate-to-extreme pain after surgery. The current standard of care for post-surgical pain includes a variety of opiate and non-opiate analgesics and muscle relaxants. While systemic opioids can effectively reduce post-surgical pain, they commonly cause side effects including drowsiness, constipation, nausea and vomiting, and cognitive impairment. Effective pain management can be compromised if patients fail to adhere to recommended dosing regimens because they are suffering from these side effects. Post-surgical pain also can be treated effectively with local anesthetics; however, their usefulness often is limited by their short duration of action.
 PERSERIS™(risperidone)
 In September 2017, we entered into an agreement with Indivior, under which we assigned to Indivior certain patents that may provide further intellectual property protection for PERSERIS, Indivior’s extended-release injectable suspension for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.  In consideration for such assignment, Indivior made an upfront non-refundable payment to DURECT of $12.5 million.  Indivior also paid a $5.0 million milestone payment in August 2018 following the FDA approval of PERSERIS.   Under the terms of the agreement with Indivior, DURECT will receive earn-out payments that are based on a single digit percentage of U.S. net sales of PERSERIS into 2026.    
 Through press releases on December 18, 2018, and February 14 and 27, 2019, Indivior has stated that:  PERSERIS was made available in the U.S. in late November 2018; The PERSERIS commercial launch took place in February 2019 with an expected field force of 50 representatives; As of February 14, 2019, payor access was at 38% and Indivior is targeting quality of access comparable with peers; Indivior is targeting appropriate health care providers (HCPs) with high volume Long Acting Injectables (LAI) practices; Indivior plans to focus on key differentiating product specific attributes, including the first and only once-monthly risperidone LAI, supplemental oral risperidone or loading dose not recommended, initial peak plasma concentrations achieved in 4 to 6 hours, and just one subcutaneous injection monthly; and Indivior remained confident in its peak year net revenue goal for PERSERIS of $200 to $300 million.

ORADUR-ADHD Program
 Market Opportunity.    Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurobehavioral condition that is estimated to affect over 6 million (approximately 9%) of U.S. children ages 2-17, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The principal characteristics of ADHD are inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The condition presents itself in childhood and can be life long as a significant number of children with ADHD continue to present symptoms as adults. 62% of children with ADHD are estimated to be under treatment with medication, utilizing stimulants such as amphetamine or methylphenidate as first-line treatments. U.S. sales of ADHD treatments were approximately $10.4 billion in 2016. The 2016 National Survey on Drug Use & Health estimates that 612,000 Americans over the age of 12 abuse stimulants for euphoric highs and increased performance or wakefulness.
 Development Strategy.    We are developing a drug candidate (ORADUR- Methylphenidate ER) based on our ORADUR Technology for the treatment of ADHD. This drug candidate is intended to provide once-a-day dosing with added tamper resistant characteristics to address common methods of abuse and misuse of these types of drugs. In August 2009, we entered into a development and license agreement with Orient Pharma, a diversified multinational pharmaceutical, healthcare and consumer products company with headquarters in Taiwan, under which we granted to Orient Pharma development and commercialization rights in certain defined Asian and South Pacific countries to ORADUR-Methylphenidate ER. We retain rights to North America, Europe, Japan and all other countries not specifically licensed to Orient Pharma. 
 Orient Pharma conducted a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way cross-over study designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of ORADUR-Methylphenidate ER (referred to as Methydur Sustained Release Capsules or Methydur) in children and adolescents with ADHD between the ages of 6 and 18 years.  According to Orient Pharma, the study was conducted in Taiwan and enrolled 110 subjects, of which 100 evaluable subjects completed the study.  For the primary efficacy endpoint, Orient Pharma observed a statistically significant difference between Methydur and Placebo treatments in the mean change of total score for the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-IV (SNAP-IV) teacher form (p=0.0044 for the intent to treat population and p=0.0104 for the per protocol population).  Orient Pharma’s safety analysis indicates that the incidence of adverse events with Methydur was similar to other approved methylphenidate products.
 In September 2018, Orient Pharma informed us that it had obtained marketing authorization for Methydur from the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan.  Methydur is indicated for the treatment of ADHD and will be available in three strengths (22 mg, 33 mg and 44 mg) in Taiwan. Orient Pharma also has stated that it expects to make Methydur commercially available in Taiwan in 2019, while seeking a partner in China and pursuing regulatory approvals in selected other countries in Southeast Asia where it has commercialization rights and a commercialization presence. We are seeking potential development and commercialization partners for ORADUR-Methylphenidate ER Capsules for major markets not licensed to Orient Pharma. 
 REMOXY ER (ORADUR-Oxycodone)
  In December 2002, we entered into an agreement with Pain Therapeutics, amended in December 2005, under which we granted Pain Therapeutics the exclusive, worldwide right to develop and commercialize selected long-acting oral opioid products using our ORADUR technology incorporating four specified opioid drugs. This agreement currently covers only REMOXY ER, a novel long-acting oral formulation of the opioid oxycodone under development with the goal of decreasing the potential for oxycodone abuse for patients who have pain serious enough to require daily, around-the-clock opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Even where abuse deterrent properties exist, opioid drugs such as oxycodone still expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse and misuse.
  Following multiple CRLs and additional studies, on August 6, 2018, Pain Therapeutics stated that it had received another CRL from the FDA citing insufficient data to support the conclusion that the benefits of REMOXY ER outweigh the risks.   Pain Therapeutics further announced a strategic reorganization to align its resources on advancing its drug and diagnostic assets in Alzheimer’s disease. Based on their interactions with the FDA, Pain Therapeutics has indicated that they and the FDA have disagreements around comments and conclusions made by the FDA during a regulatory review of the NDA for REMOXY ER. While Pain Therapeutics commenced an appeal 
 9

process in November 2018, there can be no assurance that they will continue to pursue an appeal or that any such appeal will be successful.
 Drug Delivery Technologies and Programs
 Our drug delivery technologies are designed to deliver the right drug to the right place, in the right amount and at the right time to treat a variety of chronic, acute and episodic diseases and conditions. We aim to improve therapy for a given disease or patient population by controlling the rate and duration of drug administration. In addition, if advantageous for the therapy, our technologies can target the delivery of the drug to its intended site of action.
 Our technologies are suitable for providing long-term drug therapy because they can often store highly concentrated, stabilized drugs in a small volume and protect the drug from degradation by the body. This, in combination with the ability to continuously deliver desired doses of a drug, can extend the therapeutic value of a wide variety of drugs, including, in some cases, those which would otherwise be ineffective, too unstable, too potent or cause adverse side effects. In some cases, delivering the drug directly to the intended site of action can improve efficacy while minimizing unwanted side effects elsewhere in the body, which often limit the long-term use of many drugs. Our pharmaceutical systems may thus provide better therapy for chronic diseases or conditions, or for certain acute conditions where longer drug dosing is required or advantageous, by replacing multiple injection therapy or oral dosing, improving drug efficacy, reducing side effects and ensuring dosing compliance. Our technology may thereby improve patients’ quality of life by eliminating more repetitive treatments, reducing dependence on caregivers and allowing patients to lead more independent lives.
 We currently have several major active drug delivery technology platforms:
 The SABER and CLOUD Bioerodible Injectable Depot Systems
 Our bioerodible injectable depot systems include our SABER and CLOUD platform technologies. SABER uses a high viscosity base component, such as sucrose acetate isobutyrate (SAIB), to provide controlled release of a drug. When the high viscosity SAIB is formulated with drug, biocompatible excipients and other additives, the resulting formulation is easily injectable with standard syringes and needles. After injection of a SABER formulation, the excipients diffuse away, leaving a viscous depot which provides controlled sustained release of drug. CLOUD is a class of bioerodible injectable depot technology which generally does not contain SAIB but includes various other release rate modifying excipients and/or bioerodible polymers to achieve the delivery of drugs for periods of days to months from a single injection. We are researching and developing a variety of controlled-release products based on the SABER and CLOUD technologies. Based on research and development work to date, our bioerodible injectable depot technologies have shown the following advantages:

• | Peptide/Protein/Small Molecule Delivery—The chemical nature of our bioerodible injectable depot systems tends to repel water and body enzymes and thereby stabilizes proteins and peptides. For this reason, we believe that bioerodible injectable depot systems are well suited as a platform for biotechnology therapeutics based on proteins and peptides.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Controlled Onset and Release—Typically, controlled release injections are associated with an initial higher release of drug immediately after injection (also called “burst”). Animal and human studies have shown that our bioerodible injectable depots can be associated with less post-injection burst than is typically associated with other commercially available injectable controlled release technologies, while still achieving controlled rapid onset of drug concentration.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High Drug Loading—Drug loading in our bioerodible injectable depot formulations can be as high as 30%, considerably greater than is typical with other commercially available injectable controlled release technologies. As a result, smaller injection volumes are possible with this technology.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of Administration—Prior to injection, our bioerodible injectable depot formulations are fairly liquid and therefore can be injected through small needles. Additionally, because of the higher drug concentration of our bioerodible injectable depot formulations, less volume is required to be injected. In some cases, small injection volumes and more liquid solutions can result in easier, less painful administration.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patent Protection—Our bioerodible injectable depot technology is covered by United States and foreign patents. See “Patents, Licenses and Proprietary Rights” below.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 10

 
• | Ease of Manufacture—Compared to microspheres and other polymer-based controlled release injectable systems, in some cases, our bioerodible injectable depot formulations are readily manufacturable at low cost.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The SABER technology is the basis of POSIMIR (described above). The SABER technology is also utilized in our ophthalmic program with Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Santen), as well as multiple feasibility programs. In our clinical studies thus far, our bioerodible injectable depot formulations have been observed to be generally safe and well-tolerated.
 The SABER technology is also the basis for SucroMate™ Equine, an injectable animal health drug utilizing our SABER technology to deliver the peptide deslorelin. This was the first FDA approved SABER injectable product when it was launched in 2011 by CreoSalus, Inc.
 The ORADUR Sustained Release Gel Cap Technology
 We believe that our ORADUR sustained release technology can transform short-acting oral capsule dosage forms into sustained release oral products. Products based on our ORADUR technology can take the form of an easy to swallow capsule that uses a high-viscosity base component such as sucrose acetate isobutyrate (SAIB) to provide controlled release of active ingredients for a period of 12 to 24 hours of drug delivery. Oral dosage forms based on the ORADUR gel-cap may also have the added benefit of being less prone to abuse (e.g., by crushing and then snorting, smoking, injecting or extracting by mixing with alcohol or water). These properties have the potential to make ORADUR-based products an attractive option for pharmaceutical companies that seek to develop abuse-deterrent oral products.
 The ORADUR technology is the basis of our ORADUR-Methylphenidate ER and REMOXY ER programs (described above).
  Depot Injectable Programs
 In addition to biologic drugs, many traditional small molecule drugs have to be given by frequent injections, which is costly, inconvenient and may result in either unwanted side effects or suboptimal efficacy. We have active programs underway to improve our depot injectable systems and to apply those systems to various drugs and drug candidates, and have entered into a number of feasibility studies with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to test their products in our systems. The ophthalmic program with Santen is a project which started as a depot injectable feasibility project and then matured into a development and license agreement. 
 DURECT Strategy
 Our objective is to develop multiple pharmaceutical products that address significant unmet medical needs and improve patients’ quality of life. To achieve this objective, our strategy includes the following key elements:
 Focus on Areas with the Potential for Significant Value Creation.  We view patients, physicians, the healthcare system, payers, and strategic partners, as all being important stakeholders in our company.  We believe that developing the products in our pipeline, which may address significant unmet medical needs and may create value for our stakeholders, also has the potential to create value for our shareholders.
 Apply our Drug Development Expertise to New Chemical Entities Derived from our Epigenetic Regulator Program.    We have assembled a core team of employees with considerable experience in drug development, and it is our intent to leverage their capabilities by developing pharmaceuticals derived from our Epigenetic Regulator Program. We believe that these new chemical entities may have utility for several metabolic diseases such as NAFLD, NASH and other liver conditions, in acute organ injuries such as AH and AKI, in various orphan diseases, and in inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. We believe that these product candidates may be of interest to other pharmaceutical companies and that it may be possible to license the rights to certain products, formulations, indications or territories from this program while retaining the rights to other product candidates, formulations, indications or territories for either our own development and commercialization or for licensing at a later stage of development.
 Focus on Certain Acute Indications, Chronic Debilitating Medical Conditions and Certain Local Pain Conditions.    Many of the diseases and disorders that present great challenges to medicine include pain management, CNS disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, acute organ injury, ophthalmic conditions 
 11

and other chronic diseases. In addition, we have identified certain local and acute pain and other medical conditions that we believe can be addressed by improved therapeutics. Our current efforts focus on using our versatile drug delivery platform technologies to develop products that address these medical conditions and on exploiting our Epigenetic Regulator Program through which we have identified new chemical entities that may have utility in conditions such as chronic metabolic/lipid disorders and acute organ injuries.
 Diversify Risk by Pursuing Multiple Programs in Development.    In order to reduce the risks inherent in pharmaceutical product development, we have diversified our product pipeline such that, between our own programs and those where we have collaborated, we have multiple programs with the potential to generate significant value. We believe that having multiple programs in development helps mitigate the negative consequences to us of any setbacks or delays in any one of our programs.
 Enable Product Development Through Strategic Agreements.    We believe that entering into selective strategic collaborations and other arrangements with respect to our product development programs and technology can enhance the success of our product development and commercialization, the value of our intellectual property portfolio, mitigate our risk and enable us to better manage our operating costs. Additionally, such collaborations and arrangements enable us to leverage investment by third parties and reduce our net cash burn, while retaining significant economic rights.
 Build Our Own Commercial Organization.    In the future, we may elect to build our own commercial, sales and marketing capability in order to capture more of the economic value of certain products that we may develop. If we choose to enter into third-party collaborations to commercialize our pharmaceutical product candidates, we may in the future enter into these alliances under circumstances that allow us to participate in the sales and marketing of these products.
Strategic Agreements
 We have entered into the following strategic collaboration and other key agreements:
 Virginia Commonwealth University Intellectual Property Foundation. We have entered into an exclusive in-license and research and development agreement with the Virginia Commonwealth University Intellectual Property Foundation regarding the new chemical entities under development through our Epigenetic Regulator Program, including DUR-928. Under this licensing arrangement, we have agreed to undertake certain efforts to bring licensed products to market, pay for prosecution of related patents and report on progress to VCU. In addition, we are obligated to pay low single-digit percentage patent royalties on net sales of licensed products, subject to annual minimum payments and additional milestone payments. This license includes rights to seven patent families. We may terminate this agreement at any time by written notice, and Virginia Commonwealth University may terminate this agreement by written notice if there is an uncured material breach.
 Indivior UK Ltd.  In September 2017, we entered into a patent purchase agreement (the “Indivior Agreement”) with Indivior.  Pursuant to the Indivior Agreement, we assigned to Indivior certain patents that may provide further intellectual property protection for PERSERIS, Indivior’s once-monthly injectable risperidone product for the treatment of schizophrenia.  In consideration for such assignment, Indivior made an upfront non-refundable payment to us of $12.5 million, and also agreed to make an additional $5 million payment to us contingent upon FDA approval of PERSERIS, as well as quarterly earn-out payments based on a single digit percentage of U.S. net sales for certain products covered by the assigned patent rights, including PERSERIS. The assigned patent rights include granted patents extending into at least 2026.  We also receive a non-exclusive right under the assigned patents to develop and commercialize certain risperidone-containing products and products that do not contain risperidone or buprenorphine.  The agreement contains customary representations, warranties and indemnities of the parties. We received the non-refundable payment of $12.5 million from Indivior in September 2017 and recognized this amount as revenue from sale of intellectual property rights in the year ended December 31, 2017 as we did not have any continuing obligations under the purchase agreement.  In July 2018, Indivior announced that the FDA had approved the NDA for PERSERIS thereby triggering the $5.0 million payment, which was received by DURECT in August 2018.  
 Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.    In December 2014, we and Santen entered into a definitive agreement (the Santen Agreement). Pursuant to the Santen Agreement, we have granted Santen an exclusive worldwide license to our proprietary SABER formulation platform and other intellectual property to develop and commercialize a sustained release product utilizing our SABER technology to deliver an ophthalmology drug. Santen controls and funds the development and commercialization program, and the parties have established a joint management committee to oversee, review and coordinate the development activities of the parties under the Agreement.
 12

In connection with the license agreement, Santen paid us a non-refundable upfront fee of $2.0 million in cash and agreed to make contingent cash payments to us of up to $76.0 million upon the achievement of certain milestones, of which $13.0 million are development-based milestones (none of which has been achieved as of December 31, 2018), and $63.0 million are commercialization-based milestones including milestones requiring the achievement of certain product sales targets (none of which has been achieved as of December 31, 2018). Santen will also pay for certain of our costs incurred in the development of the licensed product. If the product is commercialized, we would also receive a tiered royalty on annual net product sales ranging from single-digit to the low double digits, determined on a country-by-country basis. Santen may terminate the Agreement without cause at any time upon prior written notice, and either party may terminate the Agreement upon certain circumstances including a material uncured breach. As of December 31, 2018, the cumulative aggregate payments received by us under this agreement were $3.3 million. In January 2018, we were notified by Santen that due to a shift in near term priorities, Santen has elected to reallocate research and development resources and put our program on pause until further notice. While the main program is on pause, the parties are working together on a limited set of research and development activities funded by Santen.
 Sandoz AG.  In May 2017, the Company and Sandoz AG (“Sandoz”) entered into a license agreement to develop and market POSIMIR in the United States. POSIMIR is the Company’s investigational post-operative pain relief depot that utilizes the Company’s patented SABER technology to deliver bupivacaine to provide up to three days of pain relief after surgery. Under terms of the agreement, Sandoz made an upfront payment of $20 million and the Company was eligible for additional milestone and royalty payments. In May 2018, the Company and Sandoz entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the license agreement, under which, among other things, both parties’ termination provisions were modified. In January 2019, Sandoz AG provided notice that it was returning to DURECT all of its U.S. development and commercialization rights to POSIMIR.  The parties are in dispute with regard to Sandoz’s obligation to pay a termination fee to DURECT.  DURECT has initiated a formal dispute resolution process related to the termination fee. 
 Pain Therapeutics, Inc.    In December 2002, we entered into an agreement with Pain Therapeutics, amended in December 2005, under which we granted Pain Therapeutics the exclusive, worldwide right to develop and commercialize selected long-acting oral opioid products using our ORADUR technology incorporating four specified opioid drugs. Under the agreement with Pain Therapeutics, subject to and upon the achievement of predetermined development and regulatory milestones for REMOXY ER, we are entitled to receive milestone payments of up to $3.0 million in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2018, we had received $1.5 million in cumulative milestone payments. In addition, if commercialized, we will receive royalties of between 6.0% to 11.5% of net sales of REMOXY ER depending on the sales volumes. This agreement can be terminated by either party for material breach by the other party and by Pain Therapeutics without cause. This agreement currently covers only REMOXY ER, a novel long-acting oral formulation of the opioid oxycodone under development with the goal of decreasing the potential for oxycodone abuse. If approved, REMOXY ER would be intended for patients who have pain serious enough to require daily, around-the-clock opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Even where abuse deterrent properties exist, opioid drugs such as oxycodone still expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse and misuse.  Following multiple CRLs and additional studies, in August 2018, Pain Therapeutics stated that it had received another CRL from the FDA citing insufficient data to support the conclusion that the benefits of REMOXY ER outweigh the risks.  Pain Therapeutics further announced a strategic reorganization to align its resources on advancing its drug and diagnostic assets in Alzheimer’s disease. Based on their interactions with the FDA, Pain Therapeutics has indicated that they and the FDA have disagreements around comments and conclusions made by the FDA during a regulatory review of the NDA for REMOXY ER. While Pain Therapeutics commenced an appeal process in November 2018, there can be no assurance that they will continue to pursue an appeal or that any such appeal will be successful.
 As of December 31, 2018, the cumulative aggregate payments received by us from Pain Therapeutics under this agreement were $40.4 million. In addition, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized zero, zero and $653,000 of product revenue, respectively, related to key excipients for REMOXY ER and the associated cost of goods sold was zero, zero and $216,000, respectively.
 Commercial Product Lines
 ALZET
 The ALZET product line consists of miniature, implantable osmotic pumps and accessories used for experimental research in mice, rats and other laboratory animals. These pumps are neither approved nor intended for human use. ALZET pumps continuously deliver drugs, hormones and other test agents at controlled rates from one 
 13

day to six weeks without the need for external connections, frequent handling or repeated dosing. In laboratory research, these infusion pumps can be used for systemic administration when implanted under the skin or in the body. They can be attached to a catheter for intravenous, intracerebral, or intra-arterial infusion or for targeted delivery, where the effects of a drug or test agent are localized in a particular tissue or organ. The wide use and applications of the ALZET product line is evidenced by the more than 16,000 scientific references that now exist. 
 LACTEL Absorbable Polymers
 We currently design, develop and manufacture a wide range of standard and custom biodegradable polymers based on lactide, glycolide and caprolactone under the LACTEL brand for pharmaceutical and medical device clients for use as raw materials in their products. These materials are manufactured and sold by us directly from our facility in Alabama and are used by us and our third-party customers for a variety of controlled-release and medical-device applications, including several FDA-approved commercial products.
Marketing and Sales
 Historically, we have established strategic distribution and marketing alliances for our product candidates to leverage the established sales organizations that certain pharmaceutical companies have in markets we are targeting. In the future, we may elect to build our own commercial, sales and marketing capability in order to capture more of the economic value of certain products that we may develop. If we choose to enter into third-party collaborations to commercialize our pharmaceutical product candidates, we may in the future enter into these alliances under circumstances that allow us to participate in the sales and marketing of these products. We will continue to pursue strategic alliances and collaborators from time to time consistent with our strategy to leverage the established sales organizations of third-party collaborators. 
 We market and sell our ALZET and LACTEL product lines through a direct sales force in the U.S. and through a network of distributors outside of the U.S.
 Suppliers
 We purchase sucrose acetate isobutyrate, a raw material for our ORADUR and SABER-based pharmaceutical systems, including Methydur, POSIMIR, SucroMate, and REMOXY ER, from Eastman Chemical Company. We expect that we will continue to be able to obtain sufficient supply of these raw materials to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. We do not have in place long term supply agreements with respect to all of the components of any of our pharmaceutical product candidates, however, and are subject to the risk that we may not be able to procure all required components in adequate quantities with acceptable quality, within acceptable time frames or at reasonable cost.
Customers
 Our product revenues principally are derived from sales of the ALZET product line to academic and pharmaceutical industry researchers, the LACTEL product lines to pharmaceutical and medical device customers, and from the sale of certain key excipients that are included in Methydur, SucroMate, REMOXY ER and other products. Until such time that we are able to bring our pharmaceutical product candidates to market, if at all, we expect these to be our principal sources of product revenue. We also receive revenue from collaborative research and development arrangements with our third-party collaborators. In 2018, Indivior and a pharmaceutical company with which we have a feasibility agreement accounted for 27% and 14% of our total revenues, respectively.  In 2017, Sandoz and Indivior accounted for 41% and 25% of our total revenues, respectively.  In 2016, Tolmar Inc. accounted for 15% of our total revenues.
 Manufacturing
 The process for manufacturing our pharmaceutical product candidates is technically complex, requires special skills, and must be performed in qualified facilities. We have entered into development and commercial manufacturing agreements with third parties for the manufacture of POSIMIR and DUR-928. In addition, we have a small multi-discipline manufacturing facility in California that we have used to manufacture research and clinical supplies of several of our pharmaceutical product candidates under GMP, including POSIMIR, DUR-928 and REMOXY ER. In the future, we may develop additional manufacturing capabilities for our pharmaceutical product candidates and components to meet our demands and those of our third party collaborators by contracting with third party manufacturers and by potentially constructing additional manufacturing space at our current facilities in 
 14

California and/or Alabama. We manufacture our ALZET product line and certain key components for POSIMIR, Methydur, and REMOXY ER at one of our California facilities and our LACTEL product line at our Alabama facility.
 Patents and Proprietary Rights
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents, to protect trade secrets, to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary molecules and technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. As of March 4, 2019, we owned or exclusively in-licensed over 50 unexpired issued U.S. patents and over 285 unexpired issued foreign patents (which include granted European patent rights that have been validated in various EU member states). In addition, we have over 30 pending U.S. patent applications and over 145 foreign applications pending in Europe, Australia, Japan, Canada and other countries.
 Proprietary rights relating to our planned and potential products will be protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents owned by or licensed to us may not afford protection against competitors, and our pending patent applications now or hereafter filed by or licensed to us may not result in patents being issued. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, their enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty. Our patents or patent applications, or those licensed to us, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted thereunder may not provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage of the patent, which could adversely affect our ability to protect future product development and, consequently, our operating results and financial position.
 Because patent applications in the U.S. are typically maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months after filing and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for protection of inventions set forth in such patent applications.
 Our planned or potential products may be covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, in which case we would need to obtain a license to continue developing or marketing these products. Any required licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we do not obtain any required licenses, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to design around these patents, or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed. Litigation may be necessary to defend against or assert such claims of infringement, to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how owned by us, or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. In addition, interference, derivation, post-grant oppositions, and similar proceedings may be necessary to determine rights to inventions in our patents and patent applications. Litigation or similar proceedings could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort by us, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These efforts by us may not be successful.
 We may rely, in certain circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain contractors. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

Government Regulation
 The Food and Drug Administration.    The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. We believe that our products in development will be regulated as drugs by the FDA rather than as biologics or devices.
 The process required by the FDA under the new drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the Act) before our products in development may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
  
• | preclinical laboratory and animal tests;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical products candidates in their intended uses; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA approval of a new drug application.
--+----------------------------------------

 Section 505 of the Act describes three types of new drug applications: (1) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (section 505(b)(1)); (2) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference (section 505(b)(2)); and (3) an application that contains information to show that the proposed product is identical in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product (section 505(j)). We expect that most of the Drug Delivery Program product candidates will be evaluated for approval after submission of a new drug application under section 505(b)(2) and that our drug candidates deriving from our Epigenetic Regulator Program will be evaluated for approval after submission of a new drug application under section 505(b)(1).
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Even though several of our pharmaceutical products candidates utilize active drug ingredients that are commercially marketed in the United States in other dosage forms, we need to establish safety and effectiveness of those active ingredients in the formulation and dosage forms that we are developing.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product, its chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product candidate. We then submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we may begin human clinical trials. Each subsequent new clinical protocol must also be submitted to the FDA under the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. Our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials. Further, an independent Institutional Review Board at each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trials must review and approve any clinical study as well as the related informed consent forms and authorization forms that permit us to use individually identifiable health information of study participants.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases which may overlap:
  
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Phase 3: When Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dosage range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population, at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical study sites.

 In the case of products for severe diseases, such as chronic pain, or life-threatening diseases such as cancer, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with disease rather than in healthy volunteers. Since these patients already have the target disease or condition, these studies may provide initial evidence of efficacy traditionally obtained in Phase 2 trials, and thus these trials are frequently referred to as Phase 1/2 clinical trials or Phase 1b trials. We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials of our pharmaceutical products in development within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the Institutional Review Board or the sponsor may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. During the clinical development of products, sponsors frequently meet and consult with the FDA in order to ensure that the design of their studies will likely provide data both sufficient and relevant for later regulatory review; however, no assurance of approvability can be given by the FDA.
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as part of a new drug application, or NDA, for approval of the marketing and commercial shipment of the product. Submission of an NDA may require the payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, and although the agency has defined user fee goals for the time in which to respond to sponsor applications, there can be no assurance that the FDA will act in any particular timeframe. The FDA may deny a new drug application if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical trials be conducted. Even if such data is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the new drug application does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. Requirements for additional Phase 4 studies (post approval marketing studies) to confirm safety and effectiveness in a broader commercial use population may be imposed as a condition of marketing approval. In addition, the FDA requires surveillance programs to monitor approved products which have been commercialized, and the agency has the power to require changes in labeling or to prevent further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Any comparative claims comparing a product to other dosage forms or competitive products typically need to be supported by two adequate and well-controlled head-to-head clinical trials.
 Satisfaction of FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years and the actual time required may vary substantially, based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or any other regulatory agency will grant approval for any of our pharmaceutical products under development on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Evolving safety concerns can result in the imposition of new requirements for expensive and time consuming tests, such as for QT interval cardiotoxicity testing. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, any problems associated with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Any pharmaceutical products that we may develop and obtain approval for would also be subject to adverse findings of the active drug ingredients being marketed in different dosage forms and formulations. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business. Marketing our pharmaceutical products abroad will require similar regulatory approvals and is subject to similar risks. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.
 Any pharmaceutical products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the product or the active pharmaceutical ingredient or other components of the product. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with good 
 17

manufacturing practices, which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the GMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements.
 The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act strictly regulates drug product marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing drug products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of drug samples. The FDA has actively enforced regulations prohibiting the marketing of products for unapproved uses, and federal and state authorities are also actively litigating against sponsors who promote their drugs for unapproved uses under various fraud and abuse and false claims act statutes. We and our products are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where our products are or will be marketed. Any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market our products in those states or localities. We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
 The FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. Moreover, increased attention to the containment of health care costs in the U.S. and in foreign markets could result in new government regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.For several years, the FDA has required companies engaged in manufacturing and sale of opioid drug products to have a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure that the benefits of the drugs continue to outweigh the risks. The affected opioid drugs include brand name and generic products and are formulated with the active ingredients fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and oxymorphone. All manufacturers of long-acting and extended-release opioids must ensure that training is provided to prescribers of these medications and develop information that prescribers can use when counseling patients about the risks and benefits of opioid use. More recently, in February 2016, the FDA announced a comprehensive action plan to take concrete steps towards reducing the impact of opioid abuse on American families and communities. As part of this plan, the agency will review product and labelling decisions and re-examine the risk-benefit paradigm for opioids.
 Certain of our drug candidates, including REMOXY ER, are subject to the REMS requirement. These required REMS programs may cause delays in marketing approvals for these drug candidates. In addition, there may be increased cost, administrative burden and potential liability associated with the marketing and sale of these types of drug candidates subject to the REMS requirement, which could negatively impact the commercial benefits to us and our collaborators from the sale of these drug candidates.
 The Drug Enforcement Administration.    The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulates chemical compounds as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule I substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest risk. Certain active ingredients in REMOXY and ORADUR-Methylphenidate are listed by the DEA as Schedule II under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Consequently, their manufacture, research, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of oversight and regulation. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription. Furthermore, the amount of Schedule II substances we can obtain for clinical trials and commercial distribution is limited by the DEA and our quota may not be sufficient to complete clinical trials or meet commercial demand. There is a risk that DEA regulations may interfere with the supply of the drugs used in our clinical trials, and, in the future, our ability to produce and distribute our products in the volume needed to meet commercial demand, which could negatively impact us and our collaborators.
 Other Healthcare Laws.  In addition to FDA and DEA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, other foreign, federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti‑kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and physician payment and drug pricing transparency laws.
 The U.S. federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or 
 18

other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti‑Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the U.S. federal Anti‑Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case‑by‑case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti‑kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third‑party payor, including commercial insurers.
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year and the reported information is publically made available on a searchable website. In addition, certain states require implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.  Finally, the Physician Self-Referral (Stark) Law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to providers of “designated health services” with whom the physician or a member of the physician’s immediate family has an ownership interest or compensation arrangement, unless a statutory or regulatory exception applies.
 Competition
 We may face competition from other companies in numerous industries including pharmaceuticals, medical devices and drug delivery. POSIMIR and REMOXY ER, if approved, will compete with currently marketed oral opioids, transdermal opioids, local anesthetic patches, implantable and external infusion pumps which can be used for infusion of opioids and local anesthetics. Products of these types are marketed by Purdue Pharma, AbbVie, Janssen, Medtronic, Endo, AstraZeneca, Pernix Therapeutics, Tricumed, Halyard Health, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals, Pacira, Acorda Therapeutics, Mallinckrodt, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Novartis, Egalet, Collegium and others. Purdue Pharma, Sandoz, Actavis, Collegium, Pfizer, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Intellipharmaceutics, Egalet, Charleston Laboratories, Daiichi Sankyo, Teva Pharmaceuticals and others have also announced regulatory approval or development plans for abuse deterrent opioid products. Methydur Sustained Release Capsules and our ORADUR-ADHD product candidates, if approved, will compete with currently marketed or approved products by Shire, Johnson & Johnson, UCB, Novartis, Noven, Eli Lilly, Pfizer and others. PERSERIS will compete with currently marketed products by Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Astra Zeneca, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Otsuka, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Teva and others. Competition for DUR-928, if approved, will depend on the specific indications for which DUR-928 is approved. Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Gilead, Shire, Conatus Pharmaceuticals, Allergan, Galectin Therapeutics, Genfit, Pfizer, Roche, Galmed Pharmaceuticals, Tobira Therapeutics, Madrigal Therapeutics, Gemphire, Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk, Takeda, Vital Therapies, ChemomAb, Kowa, Boehringer Ingelheim, NGM, Lipocine, Enyo, Corcept, Second Genome, Nash Pharma, Pharmaxis, Merck, Pinnacle and others have development plans for products to treat NAFLD/NASH and other liver diseases. Ischemix, Thrasos Therapeutics, AM-Pharma, Complexa, AbbVie, AlloCure, Quark Pharmaceuticals and 
 19

others have development plans for products to treat acute kidney injury. Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis, Eli Lilly, Almirall, LEO Pharma, Pfizer, Janssen, Abbvie, Boerhinger-Ingelheim, Amgen, Sandoz, Astra-Zeneca, Anacor, Valeant, Takeda, Merck, Idera Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi, Regeneron and others have development plans for products to treat psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Numerous companies are applying significant resources and expertise to the problems of drug delivery and several of these are focusing or may focus on delivery of drugs to the intended site of action, including Alkermes, Pacira, Immune Pharmaceuticals, Innocoll, Nektar, Kimberly-Clark, Acorda Therapeutics, Flamel, Alexza, Mallinckrodt, Pfizer, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals, Egalet, Acura, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Phosphagenics, Intellipharmaceutics, Collegium Pharmaceutical, Heron Therapeutics and others. Some of these competitors may be addressing the same therapeutic areas or indications as we are. Our current and potential competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection or commercializing products before us. Many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities than we do, as well as substantially more marketing, manufacturing, financial and managerial resources. These entities represent significant competition for us. Acquisitions of, or investments in, competing pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies by large corporations could increase such competitors’ financial, marketing, manufacturing and other resources.
 Competition for our ALZET product line primarily consists of customers choosing to utilize delivery methods for their research projects other than an osmotic pump.  Competition for our LACTEL product line comes from companies including Evonik, Corbion, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, PCAS and others.  Many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities than we do, as well as substantially more marketing, manufacturing, financial and managerial resources. These entities represent significant competition for us. We may in the future face competition for our ALZET and LACTEL product lines from other companies including low cost foreign competitors. 
 Any pharmaceutical products we develop will compete in highly competitive markets. Many of our potential competitors in these markets have greater development, financial, manufacturing, marketing, and sales resources than we do and we cannot be certain that they will not succeed in developing products or technologies which will render our technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, many of those potential competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in their respective fields.
