 Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel, immune-modulating cancer vaccines based on our T-win technology platform. Our product candidates are designed to induce the immune system to simultaneously target and disrupt multiple pathways that regulate tumor-induced immunosuppression. We believe this represents a paradigm shift in the management of cancer and that our product candidates have the potential to become cornerstones of the treatment regimens of multiple solid tumors. Our lead product candidate, IO102-IO103, is designed to target the immunosuppressive mechanisms mediated by key immunosuppressive proteins such as Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and programmed death ligand (PD-L1). In a single-arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial of 30 patients with metastatic melanoma with the primary objective of investigating safety and tolerability, the secondary objective of investigating immunogenicity, and the tertiary objective of investigating clinical efficacy, IO102-IO103, in combination with nivolumab, demonstrated an ability to induce meaningful tumor regression and establish durable antitumor response while achieving a manageable tolerability profile for patients. The clinical efficacy endpoints in this trial included objective response (OR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In this trial, we observed a confirmed overall response rate (ORR) of 73% and a complete response rate (CRR) of 50%. Based on the results from this trial, IO102-IO103, in combination with pembrolizumab, was granted BTD by the FDA for treatment of unresectable/metastatic melanoma.
We enrolled the first patient in a potentially registrational Phase 3 trial for IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab as a potential first-line treatment in advanced melanoma, the IOB-013/KN-D18 trial, in May of 2022. We have made significant progress with the activation of clinical sites participating in the Phase 3 IOB-013/KN-D18 trial, ending February 2023 with nearly 100 active sites in the trial, compared to 55 at the end of October 2022. The IOB-013/KN-D18 trial has a target enrollment of 300 patients and is designed with an interim analysis of ORR one year after 75% of patients have been randomized and a final analysis of the primary endpoint of PFS for the full trial population. We expect to enroll 75% of patients in the trial by mid-2023 and to complete recruitment by the end of 2023. The trial design and discussions with FDA are aimed at potentially pursuing accelerated approval, if the trial data are favorable, based on the interim analysis of ORR, supported by other data. If the data are supportive, we also plan to file a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) based on the primary endpoint of PFS.
Our T-win platform is a novel approach to cancer vaccines designed to activate pre-existing T cells to target immunosuppressive mechanisms. Our T-win product candidates are designed to employ a dual mechanism of action: (1) direct killing of immunosuppressive cells, including both tumor cells and genetically stable cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), that express IDO and PD-L1 and (2) modulation of the TME into a more pro-inflammatory, anti-tumor environment. Our T-win technology is built upon our team’s deep understanding of both TME and a tumor’s ability to evade surveillance and destruction by the immune system. Our approach is in contrast to previous methods that have sought to either block singular immunosuppressive pathways or to direct the immune system against specific identified antigens expressed by tumor cells.
We are developing a pipeline of product candidates that leverage our T-win technology platform to address targets within the TME. In addition to melanoma, we plan to evaluate IO102-IO103 in multiple solid tumor indications to potentially expand

the market opportunity for IO102-IO103. We are also focusing on additional targets that play key roles in immunosuppression and that are expressed in a broad range of solid tumors. Our pipeline of product candidates is summarized in the table below.
    (1)In combination with pembrolizumab
(2)NSCLC = non-small cell lung cancer, SCCHN = squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, UBC = urothelial bladder cancer
 Our lead product candidate, IO102-IO103, combines our two fully-owned, novel immune-modulating vaccines, IO102 and IO103, which are designed to target IDO+ and PD-L1+ target cells, respectively. IDO and PD-L1 are often dysregulated and over-expressed in a wide range of solid tumors, and result in the inhibition of the body’s natural pro-inflammatory anti-tumor response within the TME. IO102-IO103 is designed to employ our novel dual mechanism of action approach. This is in contrast to previous approaches which have sought to block singular immunosuppressive pathways or to direct the immune system against specific identified antigens expressed by tumor cells. By combining IO102 and IO103 in a single treatment regimen, we also aim to provide a synergistic therapeutic effect on tumors.
On December 14, 2020, the FDA granted us BTD for IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma based on data from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, MM1636. BTD enables us to solicit more frequent and intensive guidance from the FDA as to how to conduct an efficient development program for IO102-IO103. The MM1636 trial was an investigator-initiated, single-arm Phase 1/2 trial of 30 anti PD-1/PD-L1 naïve patients with metastatic melanoma receiving IO102-IO103 and nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. In this trial, investigators initially observed an ORR of 80% (24 out of 30 patients); however, two of 24 patients in which a response was observed progressed before subsequent radiological confirmation, which resulted in a confirmed ORR of 73%. In addition, 50% of patients achieved a complete response (CR), or complete elimination of their tumors based on RECIST 1.1 definitions. While a total of five patients (17%) experienced a high-grade adverse event (grade 3-5), based on the 17% discontinuation rate of treatment with both nivolumab and IO102-IO103, data from this trial suggests a manageable tolerability profile for patients. In addition, we have observed treatment-induced infiltration of CD3/CD8 T cells into the tumor site in responding patients and detected IO102+IO103-specific T cells in tumors after treatment in correlative biomarker data where this was analyzed. Consistent with the earlier reported data, with an additional 15 months of patient follow-up, results from a new January 5, 2023 data cut for the MM1636 Phase 1/2 study of IO102-IO103 in combination with nivolumab for metastatic melanoma continue to be encouraging. As of that data cut-off, 30 PD-1 naïve patients were enrolled with a minimum follow-up time of time of 49.8 months. Median OS was not reached, median PFS was 25.5 months, and 50% of patients (15/30) achieved a CR, or complete disappearance of their tumors and the ORR was 80%. Patients who were anti-PD-1 antibody refractory and enrolled in cohort B in this study had no response to therapy, which we believe shows that our vaccine works best in front-line metastatic melanoma patients, as we expected in this setting.
We are currently recruiting for a Phase 3 potentially registrational trial for IO102-IO103, the IOB-013/KN-D18 trial, in combination with pembrolizumab in anti PD-1/PD-L1 treatment naive patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. While the MM1636 trial investigated IO102-IO103 in combination with nivolumab, we have made the commercial decision to investigate IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab in the Phase 3 trial. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are both IgG4 subclass antibodies that target the PD-1 receptor. In a comparative data analysis 

by Moser (Annals of Oncology 2020), researchers found no difference between the effectiveness of frontline pembrolizumab and nivolumab in patients with advanced melanoma. The Phase 3 trial also includes a concurrent evaluation of the initial participants to allow for an assessment of safety (a safety run-in) for the combination of IO102-IO103 and pembrolizumab. The pembrolizumab for this trial is being supplied by Merck pursuant to a Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement that we entered into in September 2021. The independent data monitoring committee for the IOB-013/KN-D18 trial convened its first meeting in December 2022 to review initial safety data from the trial and recommended that the trial continue without any modifications.
 We are also developing IO102-IO103 for several other solid tumor indications. We are conducting a Phase 2 basket trial, the IOB-022 trial, which will enable us to investigate multiple first-line solid tumor indications in anti PD-1/PD-L1 treatment naïve patients with metastatic disease. This basket trial is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with PD-L1 TPS  50%, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) with CPS  20, and urothelial bladder carcinoma (UBC) with CPS  10. We initiated the IOB-022 trial in April 2022. We announced encouraging initial data from the first NSCLC patients enrolled in the study in January 2023. Of the 10 patients enrolled, 9 were efficacy evaluable per protocol having received at least one full cycle of treatment. Among the 9 evaluable patients, 4 patients had a partial response while 4 had stable disease; one patient had progressive disease. The safety profile observed to date in this study is consistent with prior clinical experience with IO102-IO103. We expect to report additional data from this study in 2023. In addition to first-line cancer indications, we also plan to investigate IO102-IO103 when used before or after curatively intended surgery as a neo-adjuvant/adjuvant therapy. As with our targeted first-line cancer indications, we plan to conduct a Phase 2 basket trial, the IOB-032 trial, which will enable us to investigate multiple solid tumor indications in anti PD-1/PD-L1 naïve settings focused initially on melanoma and SCCHN. We expect to initiate this trial in the second half of 2023.
Our development of IO102-IO103 is based on our prior separate development of IO102 and IO103. IO102 is our fully-owned novel product candidate containing a single IDO-derived peptide sequence designed to engage and activate IDO-specific human T cells. IDO small molecule inhibitors have shown clinical potential in combination with PD-1 antibodies in early clinical trials, but have not been able to demonstrate the same level of efficacy in later-stage clinical trials. Our Phase 1 non-randomized trial of IO101, our first-generation IDO therapy, in NSCLC resulted in proof of concept for our approach, with 47% of patients displaying clinical benefit and an OS of 26 months in the treatment arm compared to 8 months in the group receiving standard of care. There were no grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs). We have completed testing of IO102 in a randomized Phase 1/2 trial in combination with pembrolizumab standard-of-care in first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC. IO103 is our fully-owned, novel product candidate containing a single PD-L1-derived peptide designed to engage and activate PD-L1 specific human T cells. Continued clinical development of IO102 and IO103 will be focused on their use in our dual- and multi-antigen approaches. 
IO112 is our fully-owned, novel product candidate containing a single Arginase 1-derived peptide designed to engage and activate Arginase 1-specific human T cells. IO112 is designed to target T cells that recognize epitopes derived from Arginase 1, which is an immunoregulatory enzyme highly expressed in difficult-to-treat tumors associated with high levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) including colorectal, breast, prostate and pancreatic and ovarian cancers. Arginase overexpression is a well-documented tumor escape mechanism. IO112 is currently being tested in a single arm first-in-human Phase 1 trial in patients with arginase-positive solid tumors conducted in an investigator-initiated trial at the University of Copenhagen. We plan to be ready to file an IND for IO112 in 2023.
In addition to IO102, IO103 and IO112, we are evaluating additional product candidates that we believe have potential for use in solid tumors. All our compounds in preclinical development are designed to target well-documented immunosuppressive molecules that are known to be overexpressed in the TME across a wide range of tumors. These targets provide additional opportunities across multiple cancer indications.
Targeting TGFB1 expressing cells in the TME via a vaccine approach presents a novel and attractive way to modulatethe pathway and drive therapeutic benefit in cancer setting. We are developing and characterizing TGFB1-selective peptide vaccines capable of inducing strong immune responses. Preliminary evidence in mouse models showed that treatment with a TGFB1 vaccine drives CD4+ T cell infiltration in the TME and might promote in vivo targeted cell killing. Further experimental work to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of a TGFB1 vaccine is ongoing to support further development of a TGFB1 vaccine to modulate the TME for therapeutic benefit in a wide range of cancer indications.

Our Strategy
To achieve our goals, we aim to leverage our T-win platform to transform cancer treatments by creating a broad portfolio of cancer vaccines focused on targets within the TME.
The key elements of our strategy are to:
•Advance our lead product candidate, IO102-IO103, toward approval in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy in first-line treatment of advanced melanoma. We were granted BTD by the FDA based on a confirmed ORR of 73% and CRR of 47% in MM1636, the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of IO102-IO103 in combination with nivolumab in first-line treatment of patients with melanoma. We enrolled the first patient in the IOB-013/KN-D18 trial in May of 2022. We have made significant progress with the activation of clinical sites participating in the Phase 3 IOB-013/KN-D18 trial, ending February 2023 with nearly 100 active sites in the trial, compared to 55 at the end of October 2022. The IOB-013/KN-D18 trial has a target enrollment of 300 patients and is designed with an interim analysis of ORR one year after 75% of patients have been randomized and a final analysis of the primary endpoint of PFS for the full trial population. We expect to enroll 75% of patients in the trial by mid-2023 and to complete recruitment by the end of 2023. The trial design and discussions with FDA are aimed at potentially pursuing accelerated approval, if the trial data are favorable, based on the interim analysis of ORR, supported by other data. If the data are supportive, we also plan to file an MAA with the EMA based on the primary endpoint of PFS; 
 •Broaden clinical development of IO102-IO103 into other solid tumor settings through basket trials in the first line metastatic and neo-adjuvant / adjuvant treatment settings. We are executing a Phase 2 basket trial, IOB-022, of IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab in the first line solid tumor setting. This basket trial enrolls PD-1/PD-L1 treatment naïve patients with metastatic disease, including NSCLC, SCCHN and UBC. We enrolled the first patient in our Phase 2 basket trial in solid tumors in 2022 and released encouraging initial data from the evaluable patients in January 2023. Of the 10 patients enrolled, 9 were efficacy evaluable per protocol having received at least one full cycle of treatment. Among the 9 evaluable patients, 4 patients had a partial response while 4 had stable disease; one patient had progressive disease. The safety profile observed to date in this study is consistent with prior clinical experience with IO102-IO103. We expect to report additional data from this study in 2023. We also plan to initiate a Phase 2 basket trial, IOB-032, of IO102-IO103 in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody therapy in the neo-adjuvant / adjuvant treatment setting. In this trial, combination therapy will be used before and after curatively intended surgery. This basket trial will enable us to investigate multiple solid tumor indications in anti PD-1/ PD-L1 naive patients, and will focus initially on melanoma and SCCHN. We expect to initiate this trial in the second half of 2023 and receive data in 2024. These two basket trials build on the data that we have generated from prior trials of our single epitope product candidates, IO102 and IO103, including the anti-tumor activity that we have observed with the use of our first-generation IDO compound in NSCLC; 
 •Leverage our T-win technology platform to design and advance a portfolio of novel immune-modulating cancer vaccine product candidates, including IO112 and additional future product candidates. Since inception, our T-win platform has allowed us to rapidly identify and develop multiple pipeline candidates. Our next product candidate, IO112, targets Arginase 1, which is over-expressed in solid tumors where MDSCs are known to play key roles in immune resistance. IO112 is currently being tested in a single arm first-in-human Phase 1 trial in patients with arginase-positive solid tumors conducted in an investigator-initiated trial at the University of 


Copenhagen. We plan to be ready to file an IND for IO112 in 2023. We are continuing to evaluate other targets within the TME, including TGFB, and intend to leverage our T-win platform to bring additional product candidates into the clinic over time which could be used alone or in combination with other candidates;
 •Strengthen our position in the immunotherapy field through the continuous innovation and expansion of our T-win platform. We have extensive knowledge about the characterization of immunosuppressive mechanisms in the TME and pharmacology. We plan to continue investing in our platform in order to stay at the forefront of developments in the space. Our platform is supported by a strong patent portfolio consisting of 17 different families, filed in all major markets with a long exclusivity periods. We plan to continue investing in intellectual property to support our platform and product candidates; 
 •Maximize the value of our product candidates and pipeline by selectively entering into strategic collaborations. We hold worldwide development and commercial rights to our pipeline of compounds, and we intend to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, in key geographies. We have entered, and may enter in the future, into collaborations that grant us access to certain compounds owned by third parties to enable therapeutic combinations that could enhance the clinical and commercial potential of our product candidates. For example, we have entered into a non-exclusive, clinical supply agreement with MSD International GmbH (MSDIG)/Merck, to evaluate IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and as a neo-adjuvant/adjuvant therapy; and 
 •Build a leading immuno-oncology company while maintaining a strong culture of innovation, valuing diversity and putting patients at the center of everything we do. We will continue to apply our deep understanding of the TME to the discovery and development of novel immune-modulating cancer vaccines that have the potential to provide breakthroughs for cancer patients who are currently underserved by available therapies. We place a high value on the diversity of our team – including gender, background and expertise – to foster this culture of innovation. 
 Our Approach to Therapeutic Cancer Vaccines
Our product candidates are designed to induce the immune system to simultaneously target and disrupt multiple pathways that regulate tumor-induced immunosuppression. We believe this represents a paradigm shift in the management of cancer and that our product candidates have the potential to become cornerstones of the treatment regimens of multiple solid tumors. Our T-win technology is built upon our team’s deep understanding of both the TME and a tumor’s ability to evade surveillance and destruction by the immune system.
The Role of the Immune System in Fighting Cancer
The Immune System
The immune system is a dynamic and self-regulating network of cells and molecules that cooperate to help the body fight disease. It is able to detect pathogens and can distinguish abnormal cells, such as tumor cells, from healthy tissue. The immune system has evolved to detect such dangers to the body through the detection of molecules or molecular structures called antigens. When exposed to pathogens or abnormal cells, the immune system responds by recognition of antigens and becomes activated to defend against them. The first line of biological defense is a general, rapid response by the innate immune system which is essential for immediate recognition and attack of pathogens as well as tumor cells. This innate response then activates and triggers a more targeted response by the adaptive immune system. Through such adaptive immune responses, the body can develop long-term immunity, or immunologic memory, to specific pathogens and other threats. Immunologic memory is established through generation of specific B cells and T cells, equipping the body to recognize, counteract and neutralize pathogens and other threats, such as cancer cells.
 The intricate system of how immune cells interact and propagate a signal to elicit an immune response in cancer is known as tumor immune regulation. Successful antitumor immunity requires optimal interactions between immune and non-immune constituents of the TME. The immune system comprises both activating and suppressing functions built up by a myriad of different cell types. These various immune cells function to activate or suppress immune activity. We have described some of the key cellular factors contributing to anti-tumor immunity below and have classified them as immune activators or immune suppressors. However, many of these cells types can differentiate and acquire distinct functions in response to changing circumstances, known as cellular plasticity, which allows cells to switch from being immune activating to immune suppressing, or the reverse, based on certain immune triggers.
The Key Immune Activators and Suppressors in Anti-tumor Responses


Cell types | Immune Activators | Immune Suppressors 
Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs)A group of immune cell types that mediate cellular immune responses by processing and presenting antigens to lymphocytes. | Macrophages and Dendritic cellsBoth termed professional APCs, because of their ability to initiate a T cell response to novel antigens. | Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), tolerogenic DCs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)These are part of the heterogeneous population of APCs that inhibits T cell functions.
T cells / T lymphocytesSpecialized white blood cells that recognize and destroy infected or unhealthy cells, such as tumor cells. | Effector T cellsEffector T cells consists of two main groups: CD4+ T CellsAlso known as helper T cells, CD4+ T cells produce cytokines and help maximize the expansion of the CD8+ T cell population in a primary immune response and facilitate the generation of specific memory CD8+ T cells; and CD8+ T CellsAlso known as cytotoxic T cells, CD8+ T cells kill tumor cells, as well as infected and damaged cells. They express T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize and bind to specific antigens expressed by cancer cells and infected cells which are presented on the surface of the cells. | Regulatory T cells (Tregs)Tregs suppress activation, proliferation and cytokine production of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and APCs. 

 The immune system has the capacity to detect tumor cells and employ a variety of biological mechanisms, or immune effector functions, to specifically target and destroy these cells. However, tumors are adept at undermining the normal immune system functions that allow cancer cells to evade such detection and destruction.
The Tumor Microenvironment
Tumors can generate signals that promote tumor growth and suppress immune system functions. The TME is an immunosuppressive environment that surrounds a tumor and includes blood vessels, immune cells, and signaling molecules. A significant portion of the immune reaction against tumors occurs within the TME. There is constant interplay between the TME and the tumor itself, as signals from the tumor can facilitate immunosuppression and tumor growth. In recent years, growing understanding of this interplay has led to the successful development of therapies that modulate specific immunosuppressive mechanisms within the TME to activate the immune system against cancer cells.
Within the TME, several molecules have been identified that play critical roles in regulating immune functions. These include:
•PD-1/PD-L1: PD-1 and its ligand, PD-L1, are critical regulators of the immune system, known as immune checkpoints. The interactions between PD-1 with its ligand PD-L1 inhibit T cell effector functions against tumor cells. Tumor cells can upregulate PD-L1 to evade the attack of the immune system and PD-L1 expression is correlated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor patient prognosis. PD-L1 expression has been reported for both hematological cancer and solid tumors; 
 •IDO: IDO is a metabolic enzyme that regulates immune function through depletion of tryptophan, which is essential for T cell effector function, as well as production of immunosuppressive metabolites such as kynurenine. Such depletion of tryptophan and production of kynurenine is also known as canonical immune suppression. IDO also suppresses immunity through non-enzymic effects, known as non-canonical immunosuppression. IDO has 


been demonstrated to be a critical cellular factor contributing to the suppression of anti-cancer immunity. IDO is expressed in many solid tumors and hematological malignancies and its activity has been shown to correlate with a poor prognosis and reduced survival;
•Arginase: Arginase 1 (arginase) is an enzyme that contributes to immune regulation by catabolizing and limiting the availability of arginine, which is essential for immune effector cell survival and growth. Arginase overproduction by immunosuppressive cells such as MDSCs is a well-documented tumor escape mechanism. Arginase is highly expressed in difficult-to-treat cancers, including colorectal, breast, prostate, pancreatic and ovarian, and is associated with high levels of MDSCs; and
 •Transforming growth factor-ß: Transforming growth factor-ß is one of the key molecules that contribute to immunosuppression and it is produced in large amounts in the TME by not only cancer cells but also by suppressive and regulatory cells. Targeting TGFB1 expressing cells in the TME via a vaccine approach presents a novel and attractive way to modulate the pathway and drive therapeutic benefit in cancer setting. We are developing and characterizing TGFB1-selective peptide vaccines capable of inducing strong immune responses. Preliminary evidence in mouse models showed that treatment with a TGFB1 vaccine drives CD4+ T cell infiltration in the TME and might promote in vivo targeted cell killing. Further experimental work to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of a TGFB1 vaccine is ongoing to support further development of a TGFB1 vaccine.
 These immune markers are often dysregulated and over-expressed in a wide range of cancers. The figure below shows the role of these molecules in immunosuppression within the TME:
Figure 1: Selected Drivers of Immunosuppression in the TME.


Engaging the Immune System to Fight Cancer
In recent years, rapidly growing understanding of the interaction between cancer and the immune system, known as immuno-oncology, has led to the development of a number of therapeutic approaches that aim to counter the tumor-driven immunosuppression in the TME, to allow the immune system to fight cancer. These approaches include:
•Checkpoint Inhibitors: Checkpoint inhibitors include PD-1, PD-L1 Antibodies and CTLA-4 among others. PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies block the immunoregulatory functions of PD-1 and PD-L1, respectively, allowing T cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1 and PD-L1 antibody therapies have shown significant clinical efficacy resulting in broad commercial success. However, while such therapies are highly effective in certain subsets of patients with specific types of tumor, there are a significant number of cancer patients for whom these therapies are not effective;


•IDO Inhibitors: IDO inhibitors aim to alleviate the immunosuppressive effects of the IDO protein by blocking one of its well-established biological functions, its enzymatic activity responsible for converting tryptophan (a desirable T cell metabolite) into kynurenine (a non-desirable T cell metabolite contributing to a hostile tumor microenvironment). This is often referred to as the canonical immune suppressive function of IDO. However, there is also evidence demonstrating that the protein induces immune suppression of T-cells via a mechanism independent of tryptophan conversion, often referred to as the non-canonical immune suppressive functions of the IDO protein. Hence, blocking the immune suppressive activity of IDO will likely require blocking all its related functions. IDO inhibitors have shown clinical potential in combination with anti-PD1 antibodies in early-stage trials but have not been able to demonstrate the same level of efficacy in late-stage clinical trials. 
 •Peptide immunotherapies: These therapies are based on peptides which represent tumor antigens, pieces of a key protein, or surface markers on the cancer cell, and whose presentation to the adaptive immune system leads to a specific immunological response directed at that target. Their aim is to direct immune system effector functions, including CD8+ T cells, against antigens expressed on tumor cells. Although previous peptide immunotherapies have demonstrated attractive safety and tolerability profiles, they have only demonstrated modest clinical efficacy to date, likely reflecting (i) the ability of tumors to escape immune recognition by loss of antigens and (ii) the ability of tumors to orchestrate an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Collectively, these abilities are referred to as tumor immune escape. 
 These immuno-oncology approaches have typically sought to block single immunosuppressive pathways employed by tumors or to direct the immune system against antigens or neoantigens expressed by tumors cells. We believe that by directing the immune system against both tumor cells and other healthy cells within the TME that express immunosuppressive molecules such as PD-1 or IDO, we have the potential to drive significant benefits for patients by transforming the immune balance within the TME.
Our Approach: Targeting The TME With Our T-win Technology Platform
Our T-win vaccine platform is a novel approach to cancer vaccines designed to activate naturally occurring T cells to target immunosuppressive mechanisms. Our T-win product candidates are designed to employ a dual mechanism of action: (1) direct killing of immunosuppressive cells, including both tumor cells and genetically stable cells in the TME, that express key immunosuppressive proteins such as IDO and PD-L1 and (2) modulation of the TME into a more pro-inflammatory, anti-tumor environment. This is in contrast to previous methods that have sought either to only block singular immunosuppressive pathways or to direct the immune system against specific identified antigens expressed only by tumor cells. We believe that our dual mechanism approach has the potential to induce tumor regression, establishing lasting and durable antitumor response, and to achieve manageable tolerability for patients.
T-win is based on the discovery of naturally occurring, pro-inflammatory T cells against immunosuppressive mechanisms mediated by key immunosuppressive proteins, such as IDO and PD-L1, that are present in the periphery and among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of cancer patients and, to a lesser degree, in healthy individuals (Figure 2 below). When isolated and cultured in vitro, the self-reactive IDO- or PD-L1-specific T cells demonstrated proinflammatory and cytotoxic responses against IDO- or PD-L1-expressing target cells (Figure 3 below).
Key Components of Our T-win Technology Platform
Based on this discovery, we created our T-win technology platform to direct the immune system against, both tumor cells and genetically stable cells, within the TME, that express immunosuppressive proteins, with the goal of transforming the immune balance within the TME.
The key elements of our T-win platform are:
•Target selection: We select targets based on well-documented immunosuppressive proteins that are known to be overexpressed in the TME across a wide range of tumors. Our target selection relies on the identification of T cell immunity against these key immune resistance pathways in the TME; 
 •Epitope selection: After a target is selected, the ability of the immune system to attack cells overexpressing immunosuppressive molecules is confirmed by examination of intrinsic T cell immunity. The initial epitope selection process involves screening peptide antigens, which are designed using both an in silico algorithm and our know-how for T cell reactivity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from cancer patients across several indications. Upon identification of an immunogenic peptide antigen, the functionality of reactive T cells is then subjected to further testing to further evaluate whether activation leads to a favorable pro-inflammatory or anti-tumorigenic phenotype. Every T-win platform product candidate is designed to contain both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes that can be recognized over a wide range of patient population; and 
 •Adjuvant: T-win peptide product candidates are administered together with an adjuvant, such as Montanide. This provides protection to and facilitates effective release of our T-win peptide product candidates upon injection. It also causes local inflammation and facilitates recruitment of immune cells. This enables the antigen to be captured by antigen presenting cells and presented to T cells to drive their activation. 
 T-win Mechanism of Action
Our product candidates are designed to drive the activation and expansion of T cells reactive to immunosuppressive antigens. Upon trafficking these T cells into the tumor site, effective anti-tumor response is induced by a dual mode of action:
•Recognition and elimination of tumor cells; and 
 •Recognition and elimination of immunosuppressive cells. 
 We believe our T-win platform offers a novel approach that targets both tumor cells as well as genetically stable host immunosuppressive cells, in order to avoid immune escape. By attracting pro-inflammatory cells against immunosuppression within the TME, T-win product candidates are designed to alter the immunologically unfavorable TME environment into a pro-inflammatory milieu, thereby enhancing effective anti-tumor T cell responses. We believe that our T-win technology is the only existing platform that utilizes the intrinsic ability of cancer patients’ own T cells to target immunosuppression in the TME.
Administration of our T-win product candidates (Figure 4, step 1) selectively activates and expands pre-existing CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against the T-win product candidate targeted antigen, such as those derived from IDO, in the draining lymph nodes (Figure 4, step 2). The resulting T cells migrate to the tumor sites, where target cells with elevated expression of T-win product candidate targeted antigens are found in the TME. Upon recognition and engagement of the targeted cells, the T cells either directly eliminate the cells by cytotoxic lysis or respond by the release of proinflammatory cytokines (Figure 4, step 3). Elimination of immunosuppressive target cells and concomitant immune modulation of the TME into an inflamed environment results in net enhancement of T effector infiltration and enhanced anti-tumor responses (Figure 4, step 4).

Figure 4: Illustration of T-win Mechanism of Action


Advantages of the T-win Technology Platform
We believe our T-win platform has the potential to pave the way for novel cancer vaccines with increased therapeutic effect and limited additional tolerability concerns. Potential advantages of our T-win platform include:
•Durability of response: T-win product candidates are designed to target not only tumor cells but also genetically stable healthy immunosuppressive cells, with the aim of avoiding immune escape. We believe that our approach of direct and indirect target killing may lead to immune memory, and thus sustained anti-tumor effect over time; 
 •Dual and Multi-Epitope Design: In our product candidates, we often seek to include dual or multiple epitopes. The rationale behind this approach is based on the complexity of cancer, where individual patients suffering from the same cancer indication may have a different expression of immunoregulatory antigens and as a result may not respond to a single epitope treatment. We believe that an approach of targeting separate immune resistant pathways in the TME will enable our product candidates to address a larger pool of patients than currently available therapies reach; 
 •Tolerability: Therapies based on subcutaneously injected peptides have been observed to be well-tolerated in over 200 clinical trials. If T-win product candidates based on subcutaneously injected peptides are similarly well-tolerated, our product candidates could have the potential to be used as a component of combination therapy in early treatment settings; 
 •Versatility: Our product candidates based on our T-win platform have the potential to be used in combination with existing therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors, including the PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, pembrolizumab and nivolumab. As our product candidates target a range of immunosuppressive mechanisms mediated by proteins highly expressed among several cancer indications and the mechanism of action can potentially provide supplementary effect across different checkpoint inhibitors, we believe that the number of cancer indications and combination opportunities of our product candidates are extensive; 
 •Well-understood manufacturing process: The compounds necessary for the production of product candidates based on T-win technology are manufactured through a well-known synthetic chemistry process. We believe this enables us to reproduce high quality product at an anticipated low cost of goods; and 
 •Ease of administration: T-win product candidates are designed to be “off-the-shelf” treatments given subcutaneously on a flexible treatment schedule. These treatments can be adapted for specific cancer indications. 
 Current Trials

Proposed Registrational Trial in Melanoma Under BTD by FDA
Based on the results of the MM1636 trial, we are recruiting for a multicenter, international, open-label, randomized, two-arm Phase 3 potentially registrational trial of IO102-IO103, the IOB-013/KN-D18 trial, in combination with pembrolizumab as first-line treatment for patients with previously untreated unresectable or metastatic (advanced) melanoma. The Phase 3 trial has a target enrollment of 300 patients randomized into either the experimental arm of IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab or the pembrolizumab control arm. All patients will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every three weeks for a maximum of 35 cycles, corresponding to approximately two years of treatment. Patients randomized to the experimental arm will also be given IO102-IO103 every three weeks with an additional dose given during the induction period on Day 8 of cycles 1 and 2. IO102-IO103 will thereafter be administered subcutaneously every three weeks during the maintenance period. Each patient can be treated for a maximum of 37 administrations in total, corresponding to approximately two years of treatment. An interim analysis of ORR will be conducted one year after 75% of patients have been randomized. The primary endpoint at the final analysis will be progression free survival. The trial design and discussions with FDA are aimed at potentially pursuing accelerated approval, if the trial data are favorable, based on the interim analysis of ORR, supported by other data. The Phase 3 trial also includes a concurrent evaluation of the initial participants to allow for an assessment of safety, or safety run in.
Clinical Development in First-Line Indications
In addition to the IOB-013/KN-D18 trial discussed above, we are executing a Phase 2 basket trial, IOB-022, which will enable us to investigate multiple solid first-line tumor indications in anti PD-1/PD-L1 treatment naïve patients with metastatic disease such as NSCLC, UBC, and SCCHN. In the NSCLC portion of the trial we are investigating IO102-IO103 in patients expressing PD-L1 ≥50%, a patient population similar to Cohort A in our Phase 1/2 trial of IO102 in combination with pembrolizumab as first line treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC.
Our IOB-022 trial is a non-comparative, open label, unblinded trial and investigates the safety and efficacy of IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab, intended to investigate each of the following metastatic first-line indications:
•NSCLC with PD-L1 ≥50% 
 •SCCHN with CPS ≥20% 
 •UBC with CPS ≥10% 
 We reported encouraging initial data from the first 10 patients enrolled in the NSCLC cohort of this trial in January 2023. If the data from the initial 30 patients is supportive, we plan to first expand the sample size in Phase 2 and then pending the outcome move into a Phase 3 trial in one or more of these indications if a sufficiently strong efficacy signal is observed. The primary endpoints of the Phase 2 trial will be dual target of either ORR according to RECIST 1.1. or PFS at six months by investigator assessment. Secondary outcome measures will include PFS, duration of response, CRR, disease control rate, OS, time to response and safety reporting.
Figure 5: Schematic Clinical Development Diagram
 

The trial is currently enrolling patients in three countries (US, Spain and the UK) at 21 active sites. All treatment arms are active and recruiting. Enrolling patients for the following cohorts are as follows:
 •NSCLC (n=17)
 •SCCHN (n=6)


•UBC (n=2)
 
Encouraging initial data was reported on January 9, 2023 for the first time from 10 lung cancer patients in the company’s Phase 2 basket study (IOB-022/KN-D38) evaluating IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, or bladder cancer. Of the 10, 9 were efficacy evaluable per protocol having received at least one full cycle of treatment. Among the 9 evaluable patients, 4 patients had a partial response while 4 had stable disease; one patient had progressive disease. The safety profile observed to date in this study is consistent with prior clinical experience with IO102-IO103. The company anticipates reporting additional data from this study in 2023.
 
If the data from the initial 30 patients is supportive, we plan to first expand the sample size in Phase 2 and then pending the outcome move into a Phase 3 trial in one or more of these indications if a sufficiently strong efficacy signal is observed. The primary endpoints of the Phase 2 trial will be dual target of either ORR according to RECIST 1.1. or PFS at six months by investigator assessment. Secondary outcome measures will include PFS, duration of response, CRR, disease control rate, OS, time to response and safety reporting
 Our Product Candidates
We are developing a pipeline of product candidates that leverage our T-win technology platform to address targets within the TME. We are currently investigating IO102-IO103 in the IOB-013/KN-D18 trial and the IOB-022 trial, and we plan to initiate a Phase 2 basket trial, IOB-032, of IO102-IO103 in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody therapy in the neo-adjuvant/adjuvant treatment setting in the second half of 2023. We are also developing earlier stage product candidates that target additional immunosuppression-related targets that are expressed in a broad range of solid tumors. We expect to use these earlier stage product candidates in combination with our existing pipeline candidates.
Dual Epitope IO102-IO103
Our lead product candidate, IO102-IO103, combines our two fully-owned, novel immunotherapeutics, IO102 and IO103, which are designed to target IDO and PD-L1 expressing cells, respectively. IDO and PD-L1 are often dysregulated and over-expressed in a wide range of solid tumors, and result in the inhibition of the body’s natural pro-inflammatory anti-tumor response within the TME. By combining IO102 and IO103 in a single treatment regimen, we aim to provide a synergistic effect on tumors. We are currently executing a Phase 3 potentially registrational trial in advanced melanoma for IO102-IO103, the IOB-013/KN-D18 trial, in combination with pembrolizumab.
IO102 contains a single IDO-derived peptide sequence and is designed to engage and activate IDO-specific T cells against IDO expressing cells within the TME. This contrasts to small molecule IDO inhibitors that aim to address tumors by inhibiting IDO pathways. IO103 contains a single PD-L1-derived peptide and is designed to engage and activate PD-L1 specific human T cells against PD-L1 expressing cells. This is in contrast to PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies which aim to counter T cell inhibition by blocking the interaction between PD-1 and its ligand. Through the activation of both IDO and PD-L1 activated T cells, IO102-IO103 is designed to directly kill immunosuppressive cells, including both tumor cells and genetically stable cells within the TME, and to reduce immunosuppression within the TME, in order to confer clinically meaningful and long lasting anti-tumor responses.

The following graphic illustrates the distinct approaches by which our T-win product candidates we hypothesized to engage with IDO expressing cells versus other clinically tested IDO inhibitors.


On December 14, 2020, the FDA granted us BTD for IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma based on data from the MM1636 Phase 1/2 clinical trial. BTD enables us to solicit guidance from the FDA on generating the clinical evidence needed to support approval in a expedited manner. The MM1636 trial was an investigator-initiated, single-arm Phase 1/2 trial of 30 anti PD-1/PD-L1 naïve patients with metastatic melanoma receiving IO102-IO103 and nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. In this trial, investigators initially observed an ORR of 80% (24 out of 30 patients); however, two of 24 patients in which a response was observed progressed before subsequent radiological confirmation, which resulted in a confirmed ORR of 73%. In addition, 47% of patients achieved a CR, or complete elimination of their tumors based on RECIST 1.1 definitions. Based on the 17% discontinuation rate of treatment with both nivolumab and IO102-IO103, we believe that the data from this trial suggests a manageable tolerability profile for patients. In addition, we have observed treatment-induced infiltration of CD3/CD8 T cells into the tumor site in responding patients and detected IO102+IO103-specific T cells in tumors after treatment in correlative biomarker data where this was analyzed. We are currently recruiting for a Phase 3 potentially registrational trial for IO102-IO103, the IOB-013/KN-D18 trial, in combination with pembrolizumab. The Phase 3 trial also includes a safety run in.
IO102-IO103 specific T cells were found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and at the tumor site.
Melanoma
IO102-IO103 is currently being tested in the IOB-013/KN-D18 in treatment-naïve patients with unresectable or metastatic (advanced) melanoma. Unresectable, metastatic melanoma is a serious and life-threatening disease with a clear unmet medical need. According to the American Cancer Society, in the United States in 2023, it is expected that approximately 100,000 patients will be diagnosed with, and about 8,000 people will die from, melanoma. The incidence of cutaneous melanoma is increasing, and advanced melanoma (unresectable or metastatic) is fatal if left untreated. According to Ascierto (JAMA Oncology 2019), Robert (New England Journal of Medicine 2019), and Larkin (New England Journal of Medicine 2019), the median OS in patients with stage IV melanoma (untreated) regardless of BRAF mutation status is between 37-39 months and five-year OS is approximately 40-50%. Anti-PD-1 monotherapy leads to a five-year OS of approximately 43-51%, while anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 combination therapy can increase five-year OS to approximately 52%, but is associated with

considerable toxicity. Accordingly, there is a clear unmet need for improved combination therapies with the potential to enhance anti-PD-1 efficacy without a significant increase in toxicity.
Historical and Current Standard of Care
Historically, chemotherapy, with or without interferon-alpha (IFN-a) or IL-2, was offered to patients with advanced melanoma, with limited results. Although in the last decade, the treatment of advanced melanoma has improved with the approval of many novel agents, the current standard of care does not work for many patients. Before the availability of these treatments, according to Maio (Journal of Clinical Oncology 2015) and Garbe (The Oncologist 2011), patients with advanced melanoma had a median survival time of approximately 10 months. According to Robert (New England Journal of Medicine 2019) and Larkin (New England Journal of Medicine 2019), the current long-term survival is at least 37 to 39 months for patients with advanced melanoma regardless of BRAF mutational status based on current standard of care.
The currently approved novel agents can be divided into two main categories:
•Immunotherapies: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (CIs) targeting CTLA-4, such as ipilimumab, and PD-1, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, indirectly activate the immune system. The immune system plays an important role in the regulation of melanoma, and intravenously administered immunotherapies help overcome immune suppression; and 
 •Targeted agents: Orally administered selective inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) directly inhibit the oncogene BRAF and MAPK pathway. According to Drummer (Lancet 2018), around 35-50% of advanced melanoma patients have a targetable BRAF mutation, and in approximately 90% of these cases, the mutation consists of valine substituted with glutamic acid at amino acid 600 (BRAF V600). 
 Recommended first-line treatment options for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma and for patients with or without BRAF-mutant advanced melanoma are summarized below:
•Anti-PD-1 monotherapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab); 
 •Anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) and anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) combination therapy; 
 •Anti PD-1 (nivolumab) and LAG-3 (relatlimab) combination therapy;
 •Dabrafenib/trametinib combination targeted therapy if the activating BRAF-V600 mutation is present; and 
 •Vemurafenib/cobimetinib + atezolizumab combination targeted therapy and immunotherapy if the activating BRAF-V600 mutation is present.

For patients with tumors harboring a BRAF V600 mutation, treatment choices are between MAPK or CI therapy. Cross trial comparisons indicate that combined MAPK or BRAF plus MAPK kinase (MEK) has proven to have higher response rates than CIs. Data from cross trial comparisons suggest that the responses to CIs are slower in onset but more durable. For patients who are candidates for both treatments, standard of care guidelines recommend that CIs should be chosen as first-line therapy. Patients whose tumors are not progressing quickly and are not immediately threatening an important organ function, should be considered for CIs first, preserving MAPK for subsequent lines. However, American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines do not recommend a specific order of therapies for patients with BRAF wild-type (WT) unresectable and metastatic cutaneous melanoma.
As combination therapy with ipilimumab/nivolumab is associated with more severe toxicity, physicians must make a treatment decision between combination therapy and single agent anti-PD-1 antibody therapy after thorough evaluation regarding clinical activity and potential severe toxicity. Accordingly, we believe novel anti-PD-1 combinations with improved overall outcomes are needed for patients with advanced melanoma.
We are developing IO102-IO103 for potential treatment of patients with anti PD-1 naïve in the advanced setting advanced melanoma who are candidates for CI monotherapy, regardless of PD-L1 expression and BRAF mutation status, except for patients with rapidly progressing disease. We also plan to test IO102-IO103 as a neo-adjuvant used before surgery, followed by adjuvant therapy after surgery, in patients with melanoma, in a basket trial, the IOB-032 trial, with multiple solid tumor indications.
Development of Dual Epitope IO102-IO103 in the First-line Setting
Summary
The MM1636 trial evaluated IO102-IO103 in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, nivolumab, in 30 anti-PD-1 naïve, first-line metastatic melanoma patients. A brief summary of the MM1636 trial is below:
•30 patients included in cohort A from Herlev University Hospital in Denmark; 
 •Baseline characteristics were largely comparable with benchmark trials with the majority of patients having one or more poor prognostic factors, such as negative tumor expression, M1c stage/visceral metastases and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); 
 •Investigators initially observed an ORR of 80% (24 out of 30 patients); however, two of 24 patients in which a response was observed progressed before subsequent radiological confirmation, which resulted in a confirmed ORR of 73%. CRR was 50% with duration of response not yet reached at a median follow up time of 49.8 months as of January 5, 2023; 
 •Median PFS was 25.5 months and median OS had not yet been reached as of January 5, 2023;


•Correlative biomarker data from the MM1636 trial support the mechanism of action of IO102-IO103 in treated patients, based on the following observations: 
 •Induction of systemic therapy (IO102+IO103)-specific T cell response in blood; 
 •Treatment-induced increased infiltration of CD3/CD8 T cells into the tumor site with enhanced immune effector signature in responding patients; 
 •Detection of IO102+IO103-specific T cells in tumors post treatment; 
 •10 patients included in cohort B (patients with anti-PD-1 de-novo refractory disease) from Herlev University Hospital in Denmark; and
 •Enrollment of patients into cohort C (patients with acquired anti-PD-1 resistance, meaning those who progressed after anti-PD-1 therapy) completed in January 2023. Four of ten patients were enrolled into cohort C. 
MM1636 Cohort A Trial Design and Patient Characteristics
The MM1636 trial consists of 3 cohorts – cohort A, B and C. Within each cohort, the trial was a Phase 1/2 single arm, single center trial with the primary objective to investigate safety and feasibility, secondary objective to investigate immunogenicity and tertiary objective to investigate clinical efficacy. While the size of the trial was deemed sufficient to evaluate safety, as a single arm trial, the MM1636 trial was not designed to provide statistically significant results in respect of its clinical efficacy endpoints. The MM1636 trial patients were treated with IO102-IO103 in combination with nivolumab for up to 47 weeks and thereafter continued with nivolumab treatment according to usual guidelines. Treatment consisted of 100 µg IDO long, 100 µg PD-L1 long1, 25 µl dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 475 µl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 500 µl Montanide. The treatment was administered biweekly for 6 weeks and then every 4 weeks for 41 weeks. Patients were given a maximum of 15 treatments during one year or until progression or undue adverse events. Nivolumab was administered according to the approved label for melanoma (3 mg/kg bi-weekly for up to two years). Because of the preclinical data on IO102-IO103, which provided support for the combination effect of our IDO and PD-L1 targeted candidates, IO102 and IO103, the MM1636 trial was not designed to evaluate the individual contributions of each component antigen.
A review of patient baseline characteristics presented in table 2 for the 30 anti PD-1 naïve metastatic melanoma patients included in cohort A of the MM1636 trial shows that the majority of patients had one or more poor prognostic factors; 43% PD-L1 negative, 60% visceral metastatic disease (M1c) and 37% high LDH. The frequency of these poor prognostic factors indicates that the patient population was not subject to specific selection of good prognosis patients, as the baseline characteristics are largely similar to those in other trials.
Table 2: MM1636 Cohort A—Patient Characteristics



Tolerability
In the MM1636 trial cohort A, 77% of patients developed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 1 and 2 injection site reactions that typically manifested as transient adverse events; 77% injection site tenderness, 63% granulomas, 23% redness, 13% pain, 13% pruritus, and 3% myalgia at the injection site, most likely related to the adjuvant Montanide. Two patients discontinued treatment after eight and 11 injections, respectively, due to granulomas, tenderness and pain that limited instrumental activities of daily living. Other CTCAE grade 1-2 AEs have included rash (47%), fatigue (47%), arthralgia (30%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (23%), amylase increase (20%), dry skin (27%), pruritus (27%), infusion reaction (17%), xerostomia (17%) and myalgia (17%).
A total of five patients (17%) experienced a high-grade adverse event (grade 3-5); four patients (13%) experienced CTCAE grade 3-4 AEs, one patient with grade 3 maculopapular rash, one patient with grade 3 adrenal insufficiency and two patients with grade 3 arthralgia. One patient died (CTCAE grade 5) due to urosepsis with multi organ failure and severe hyponatremia. In addition, the patient had experienced multiple AEs including grade 3 colitis, grade 2 pneumonitis, grade 3 arthralgia, grade 2 vasculitis and grade 2 nivolumab induced infusion allergic reaction. The patient had symptoms of myocarditis at time of death with highly elevated troponin I. Bedside echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 15%, which at baseline was 60%. The myocarditis was never confirmed pathologically. All the AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were considered by the investigator to be related to nivolumab. The rate of treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation of both nivolumab and IO102-IO103 was 17%.
Response Rate in Cohort A
Results from the MM1636 trial, with a cut-off date of January 5, 2023, showed an ORR of 80% (95% confidence interval (CI); 62.7-90.5%). Two of the 24 responding patients progressed before subsequent radiological confirmation, therefore the confirmed ORR was 73.3% (95% CI; 54.1% to 87.7%). The CRR was 50.0% (95% CI; 31.3% to 68.7%).

Independent External Radiology Review
To substantiate the investigator assessed evaluation of efficacy, clinical response data was validated by blind independent external review. This was performed at an earlier cut-off date (January 2020) where an ORR of 76.7% (CI: 57.7%-90.1%) was reported with 50.0% achieving CR, 26.7% partial response (PR), and 3.3% stable disease.
Comparison With Contemporary anti PD-1 Treated Patients from the National Danish Metastatic Melanoma Database (DAMMED)
To address potential trial bias regarding treatment effect through post-hoc exploratory analysis, patients in the MM1636 trial were matched with patients from the Danish Melanoma Database (DAMMED), which is a population-based database that retrospectively collects data on patients with metastatic melanoma in Denmark.
•938 patients who were treated with a PD-1 therapy monotherapy contemporaneously (January 2015 to October 2019) were extracted. 218 of these patients were eligible for comparison and matching (all parameters available). 60 DAMMED patients were found to match; 
 •Patients were matched on age (70, > 70), gender, LDH (normal, elevated), M-stage (M1a, M1b, M1c), BRAF status (Wildtype, mutated) and PD-L1 status (<1,  1). An exact matching algorithm was used where patients in the MM1636 trial were matched with patients from DAMMED with exact same combination of variables; 


•29 patients from the MM1636 trial were matched with the exact combinations of the six variables. One patient could not be matched. To secure balance of the calculations, control patients were weighted according to the number of patients for each MM1636 patient. Estimates for treatment effects were calculated by weighted logistic regression analyses and weighted Cox proportional hazard model. A weighted binary logistic regression model was used for comparing response rates in the two matched cohorts; and 
 •Matched controls were identified for 29 patients and the ORR of 79.3% (95 CI: 61.0-90.4%) observed in the MM1636 trial was found to be significantly higher (p<0.0012) compared to the matched control group where an ORR of 41.7% (95% CI: 31.0-53.3%) was reached. Furthermore, of the 29 patients in the MM1636 trial, a significantly (p<0.0017) higher percentage of 41.4% (CI: 25.2-59.6%) patients achieved CR in the MM1636 trial, compared to 12% (CI: 6.3-21.6%) in the matched historical control group. 
 The ORR was significantly higher in the patients from the MM1636 trial than in the historical controls, suggesting that the high response rate and the long durability of response observed with the combination therapy approach are unlikely to be due to patient selection bias.
Tumor Shrinkage in Individual Patients in Cohort A
 Data showing the percent change in target lesions from the baseline is shown in Figure 6. The effect was binary, as patients either responded (24 out of 30) or progressed (six out of 30). No patients showed stable disease (SD). The icons describe melanoma risk factors. Green bars indicating CR that are not at 100% tumor reduction are in patients with lymph node metastases, as lymph nodes do not disappear but normalize in size. Blue bars at 100% indicate the disappearance of target lesions, whereas some non-target lesions may remain based on RECIST 1.1. definitions. Six of the 30 patients progressed (red bars).

The swimmer plot in Figure 7 presents individual patient-level data, including onset of PR, CR, PD and death. In addition, patients with ongoing responses are marked with an arrow. The majority of patients achieving a CR had one or more high risk factors (marked with icons) such as PD-L1 negative tumor expression, M1c stage/visceral metastases and high LDH as an indication severe disease. As of the January 5, 2023 cut-off date, response was still ongoing in 10 patients (indicated with arrows).

CRs have been observed more than 15 months after initial treatment, and as of the January 05, 2023 cutoff date, the CRR has improved to 50% as the latest included patients with a minimum follow-up of 30 months. We believe these data indicate good quality responses with a deep and durable response in most of the patients (Figure 8).
The median duration of response (DOR) was 27 months as of the January 05, 2023 cut-off date in the MM1636 trial, and 20 of the 22 patients with a radiologically confirmed response (at 12 weeks after the first response) had a response lasting greater than 182 days providing a durable response rate of 66.7% (20/30). (Figure 7 and 8).

Phase 1/2 Correlative Data
Correlative biomarker data from the MM1636 trial support the mechanism of action of IO102-IO103 in treated patients, based on the following observations:
•Induction of systemic therapy (IO102+IO103)-specific T cell response in blood was confirmed in over 96% of treated patients (Table 4); 
 •Confirmation of IO102-IO103-specific T cell clones homing into TME (Figure 12); and 
 •Treatment-induced increased infiltration T cells into TME with enhanced immune effector signature in responding patients (Figure 13).

(A) In a CR patient (PD-L1 negative, LDH high, BRAF WT, M1c), immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of tumor sections before vs on-treatment revealed more than three-folds increase in infiltrating T cells (left), majority of which were antigen-experienced (positive for PD-1/LAG-3/T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3), “Ag+ CD8”) CD8 T cells (right). (B) This was accompanied by increased signature of effector T cell activation with concomitant reduction in pro-tumorigenic genes.
MM1636 Cohort B
 Ten patients with metastatic melanoma with progressive disease on anti-PD-1 therapy were enrolled from May 2019 to September 2022. A review of patient baseline characteristics for the 10 patients with refractory (to an anti PD-1 therapy) melanoma who were included in cohort B of the MM1636 trial shows all patients to have BRAF wild-type tumors, and 50%

with available PD-L1 status (n=8) were PD-L1<1%. Nine of the patients had normal LDH levels and two patients had disease stage M1c. The mean age was 68.5 years.
 As of January 5, 2023 data cutoff, all patients were off trial treatment due to progressive disease. The most frequently reported adverse events as considered related to nivolumab were CTCAE grade 1-2 fatigue (30%), nausea (30%) and dry skin (30%). Local injection site reactions were seen in 40% of the patients.
 In terms of efficacy, the best overall response was stable disease in 2 (20%) patients and eight were progressive disease. The mOS was 16.7 months and the mPFS was 2.4 months.
In summary, patients who were PD-1 refractory and enrolled in cohort B in this study had no response to therapy, which we believe shows that our vaccine works best in front-line metastatic melanoma patients, as we expected in this setting.
 Potential Opportunities for Dual Epitope IO102-IO103
Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). The two main types of lung cancer are NSCLC and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 84% of all cases. According to the ACS, the five-year survival rate for patients suffering from highly advanced, metastatic (Stage IV) lung cancers is estimated to be 6%. The NSCLC market was expected to generate $28.5 billion in revenue in 2021, growing to $48 billion in 2026.
There is a large unmet need for improved combination therapies enhancing anti-PD-1 efficacy without a significant increase in toxicity. Until recently, the standard of care for patients with metastatic NSCLC was platinum-based chemotherapy. Recently, anti-PD-1 therapy, such as pembrolizumab, with or without chemotherapy, has changed the standard practice in first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC. According to Mok (Lancet 2019) and Gandhi (New England Journal of Medicine 2018) the ORR with pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with previously untreated metastatic NSCLC and a PD-L1 expression of 50% or higher was 39% and pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy 61%. In high PD-L1, approximately 40% of patients are alive after 30 months on pembrolizumab monotherapy. In low PD-L1, approximately 45% of patients are alive at 24 months on pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy.
Observations from a Phase 1 trial of our first generation IDO compound, IO101, provided us foundational support for our IO102-IO103 development strategy. We have initiated development of IO102-IO103 plus anti PD-1 in first-line treatment of metastatic solid tumors with high PD-L1 expression. NSCLC is one of the indications in our IOB-022 basket trial.
First Generation IDO Compound
LU1006 was an investigator-initiated Phase 1 single-arm, first-in-human trial with the primary objective of investigating safety, the secondary objective of investigating immunogenicity, and the tertiary objective of investigating clinical benefits in patients with heavily pretreated human leukocyte antigen-A2 (HLAA2) positive stage III to IV NSCLC. Patients had stable disease after standard therapy comprising of chemotherapy and targeted therapy. The trial was a non-randomized comparison against patients who had standard of care, chemotherapy, at the site and were HLAA2 negative. 15 patients were treated with IO101 as subcutaneous injections formulated in 900 microliters Montanide and imiquimod ointment. The mean treatment duration was 7.9 months (95% CI: 4.6 –11.3).
Tolerability
In 90% of the patients, CTCAE grade 1 to 2, short-term, local injection site reactions (i.e., redness, swelling, or itching) were observed. Local treatments with steroid ointments removed the symptoms. High frequencies of fatigue, shortness of breath, coughing and hemoptysis were present at baseline in the 15 NSCLC patients. These were considered to probably be related to the underlying lung cancer. Nausea and headache were observed in relation to the development of brain metastases, whereas dyspepsia, abdominal pain and diarrhea could be related to the treatment, as IDO is expressed in the epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract (Table 5). No grade 3 or higher AEs were observed in the 15 patients treated with IO101 monotherapy.
Table 5: Adverse Event Frequency by CTCAE Grade


Clinical Benefit
Clinical benefit was defined as OR or SD for a minimum of 8.5 months after treatment initiation, corresponding to at least nine injections and demonstration of SD on at least three consecutive CT scans. Based on this definition, seven of 15 (47%) patients had clinical benefit. One patient achieved a PR after 15 months treatment (ORR of 7%), and six patients obtained SD (40%).
Survival
Progression-free survival (PFS) is shown in Figure 14 below. “Censored” represents patients who are surviving without progression of disease. The median PFS was 5.2 months. Overall survival was 26 months in the 15 patients treated with IO101, compared to eight months in patients who received the hospitals standard of care, which included chemotherapy and targeted therapies. These observations provided us foundational support for our IO102-IO103 development strategy.

Figure 15: IDO Monotherapy—Overall Survival


Long Term Follow-Up
According to Kjeldsen (2018), three of 15 patients were still alive at a five-year follow up corresponding to a six-year overall survival of 20%. Two patients had continued monthly injections for five years (56 injections). One of these patients developed a PR 15 months after the first injection and remained in PR, without other subsequent anti-cancer therapy.
The other patient had a solitary distant metastasis in a retroperitoneal lymph node at baseline which normalized during treatment. All on study CT scans were without signs of relapse. Treatment was well tolerated for up to five years with no long-term AEs registered. The third long-term surviving patient discontinued treatment after 11 months due to PD. The chart below shows the duration of response for patients receiving study drug.
Figure 16: IDO Monotherapy—Duration of Response


Second Generation IDO Compound (IO102)
Our second generation IDO compound, IO102, was tested in an fully recruited, open-label, randomized Phase 1/2 trial in combination with pembrolizumab (Cohort A) or pembrolizumab with chemotherapy (Cohort B) as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC. The trial had a Phase 1 safety run-in and Phase 2 is randomized (Figure 17). The primary

objectives were to investigate the safety and efficacy of IO102 as an add on to standard of care versus standard of care. Primary endpoints were safety and ORR. Secondary endpoints include OS, PFS and biomarkers.
Figure 17: IO102-012 Trial Design


The trial was conducted as part of a clinical collaboration with Merck. The clinical trial was sponsored by IO Biotech while Merck provided pembrolizumab for the trial. Merck and IO Biotech have joint rights to the study results. IO Biotech will maintain global commercial rights to IO102.
Results presented below are from an updated analysis of patients entered into the Phase 2 part of the study, with a data cutoff of August 11, 2021. At this data cut off, a total of 110 patients were included in the trial, of which 109 received treatment. Six patients each in Phase 1 cohort A and B; 32 patients in the experimental arm A1 (IO102 with pembrolizumab), 16 patients in the control arm A2 (pembrolizumab); 33 in the experimental arm B1 (IO102 with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy) and 17 in the control arm B2 (pembrolizumab with chemotherapy) of which 16 were treated.
At the data cutoff, based on RECIST 1.1 definitions, Phase 2 Cohort A patients in the experimental arm achieved ORR of 46.9% and 43.8% in the control arm. In Phase 2 Cohort B, patients in the experimental arm achieved ORR of 36.4% and 52.9% in the control arm.
In the NSCLC portion of the IOB-022 trial, we plan to investigate IO102-IO103 in patients expressing PD-L1 ≥50%.
Tolerability Profile
The tolerability profile presented is for patients entered and treated in the Phase 2 part of IO102-012 (the safety population):


Cohort: | Experimental Arm N | | Control Arm N | | Total
A: PD-L1≥50% | | | | 16 | | 48
B: PD-L1<50% | | 33 | | 16 | | 49

 
Table 6 summarizes the AEs reported as of the more recent data cutoff in August 2021.
All patients (100%), regardless of treatment allocation, had at least one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE).
Cohort A (PD-L1 50%): 81% of patients in the experimental arm (A1) and 81% administered pembrolizumab (A2) had at least one treatment related AE. 69% of patients in A1 had AEs related to IO102. The corresponding number for treatment related AEs to pembrolizumab were 79% across both arms. Serious AEs (SAE) were reported in 41% and 31% of the patients and related treatment-related SAEs in 9% and 0%, respectively. High grade AEs (CTCAE grade 3-4) were reported in 53% and 63% of patients, with 6% and 13%, respectively of the patients discontinuing any of the treatment due to TEAEs. Fatal (grade 5) AEs occurred in 3% and 6%, respectively.
Cohort B (PD-L1 <50%): 97% of patients in the experimental arm (B1) and 100% administered pembrolizumab and chemotherapy (B2) had at least one treatment related AE. 67% of patients in B1 had AEs related to IO102. The corresponding number for treatment related AEs to pembrolizumab and were 82% across both arms. Serious AEs (SAE) were reported in 42% and 56% of the patients and related SAEs in 18% and 31%. High grade AEs (CTCAE grade 3-4) were reported in 73% and 94% with 33% and 19%, respectively, of the patients discontinuing any of the treatments due to TEAEs. Fatal (grade 5) AEs occurred in 9% and 0%, respectively.

The distribution of high-grade AEs (CTCAE grade 3 or higher, including fatal) is shown below.
Cohort A (PD-L1 50%): The most frequent high-grade AEs in cohort A1 (experimental, N=32), were infections, 18.8%, followed by vascular disorders, 15.6%. In A2 (control, N=16) the most common high grade AE was infections and infestations reported in 25.0% of patients.
Cohort B (PD-L1 <50%): The most frequent high-grade AEs in cohort B1 (experimental, N=33), were blood and lymphatic system disorders, in 39.4% of patients with 62.5% experiencing blood and lymphatic system disorders in B2 (control, N=16).
When comparing the experimental treatment in Cohort A and B with the control treatment, the safety data appears largely comparable, which suggests there was no increased frequency or severity of adverse events compared with the control arm.

Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck Cancer (SCCHN)
SCCHN includes cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx, and is one of the most common tumor types worldwide. Each year in the United States, cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx are expected to occur in more than 66,600 patients and more than 14,600 are expected to die. Locoregional SCCHN is treated with curative intent, but at a cost of functional impairment and locoregional recurrence or metastatic disease.
Standard first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic (R/M) disease that is not amenable to local therapy was for more than a decade, cetuximab, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody, plus chemotherapy with platinum and 5-fluorouracil (the EXTREME regimen), which provides a mOS of about 10 months and is associated with substantial adverse events, according to Vermorken (New England Journal of Medicine 2008).
According to Burtness (Lancet 2019), in the KN-048 Phase 3 clinical trial, mOS with pembrolizumab was 12.3 months in patients with combined positive score (CPS) > 1% and 14.9 months in CPS > 20% versus 10.7 and 10.3 months with the EXTREME regimen. In the overall population, the mOS with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was 12.3 versus 10.7 months with EXTREME. Based on above pembrolizumab plus platinum and 5-fluorouracil is an appropriate first-line treatment for

R/M SCCHN and pembrolizumab monotherapy is an appropriate first-line treatment for PD-L1-positive recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. Pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy did not improve the ORR versus EXTREME. ORR ranged from 17 to 23% with pembrolizumab versus 35-36% with EXTREME, pending on the CPS.
A significant number of cancer patients fail to respond to immunomodulatory agents regardless of PD-L1 expression, presumably because of tumor resistance mechanisms against immune attacks. According to Burtness (Lancet 2019), the two year OS in first-line R/M SCCHN ranged from 38% to 27%, pending on the CPS. Consequently, there is a large unmet need for improved combination therapies enhancing anti-PD1 efficacy without an increase in toxicity.
Besides anti-PD-1, investigations into the immune landscape of SCCHN provide a strong rationale to test agents targeting other immunomodulatory pathways such as IDO and arginase, either as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies.
The head and neck cancer market was expected to generate $3 billion in revenue in 2021 and is expected to grow to $5.8 billion by 2026.
•We are planning another development track in curative settings with neo-adjuvant (before surgery or radiotherapy)/adjuvant treatment (after surgery or radiotherapy). SCCHN may be one of these indications. 
 •We are also investigating the dual epitope strategy in first-line setting of previously untreated solid tumors. Recurrent or metastatic (R/M) SCCHN is one of these indications. 
 The ongoing and planned investigator-initiated trials will provide learnings that we can use in our own development of IO102-IO103. See “—Additional trials in other first-line indications and neo-adjuvant and adjuvant settings” for additional details on these trials.
Development of Dual Epitope IO102-IO103 in Neo-Adjuvant/Adjuvant Settings
One ongoing investigator-initiated trial at the St Luc Hospital in Belgium (HN1901) is testing the effect of single epitopes (IO102 and IO103) and later dual epitopes (e.g. IO102-IO103) as neo-adjuvant therapy (before surgery) on the TME in a randomized Phase 2 Umbrella trial in patients with resectable SCCHN. Treatment is short term with up to 3-4 weekly injections and patients are randomized against no treatment (observation before surgery as standard of care).
The primary objective is to evaluate T cell epitope specific response in blood after injections and the secondary objectives include safety, tolerability and anti-tumor effects of the epitopes tested. Translational Research will also be investigated (see Table 10 below). As of an August 2021 data cutoff, seven patients were enrolled in the HN1901 trial – four in the IO102 single epitope treatment arm and three patients in the control arm (where no treatment prior to surgery is received). The four IO102-treated patients had an aggregate of five primary tumors. Of these tumors, two tumors changed from an intermediate to a high immunoscore, a measure of how well a body’s immune cells surround and enter a tumor, two tumors remained unchanged, and one tumor had a reduced immunoscore. In the control arm, two patients maintained a stable immunoscore and one patient went from a high to intermediate immunoscore. In the IO102 treatment arm, only CTCAE grade 1-related adverse events were recorded. No serious adverse events related to the study drug were reported. No delays in standard treatment due to side effects were observed. Among the IO102-treated patients, diffusion imaging analysis showed a decrease in the median apparent diffusion coefficient (mADC) after treatment in two patients (-11% and -14%) but not in one patient. One evaluable patient in the control arm did not show changes in mADC. Diffusion imaging analysis was not conducted for one patient in the IO102 treatment arm and for two patients in the control arm.
Another investigator-initiated trial in SCCHN is planned at an academic site in the U.S. This trial will investigate dual epitope (IO102-IO103) therapy in combination with anti PD-1 as neo-adjuvant therapy before surgery followed by adjuvant therapy after surgery in patients with SCCHN.
Urothelial Bladder Cancer
UBC is a common malignancy, and was expected to occur in almost 84,000 patients in the United States in 2021. It was expected to account for approximately 17,200 deaths in 2021. In the vast majority of patients, tumors are of the transitional cell subtype. Similar to other malignancies, UBC has a high rate of survival if diagnosed early (>90%); however, even regional spread results in a decline in the five-year survival rate to under 50%. Approximately 75% of newly diagnosed cases of bladder cancer in the United States are early stage and non-muscle invasive disease. Low grade Ta lesions and high-grade T1 lesions have similar recurrence rates near 50%; however, high grade T1 lesions have a higher chance of progression than Ta lesions.

While a majority of cases treated with bladder cancer have a favorable prognosis, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) represents a heterogenous group of diseases to which risk stratification is important to further prognosticate and guide management. Multiple efforts have been made to risk stratify patients, and NMIBC is generally classified into low, intermediate, and high-risk (T1, high-grade Ta, or carcinoma in situ/Tis) groups (Table 8). Despite continued Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy, high risk groups have over a 30% recurrence risk at year one and an over 50% recurrence chance at year five. Moreover, disease progression rates are nearly 20% in high risk patients. Patients who do experience disease progression often must undergo radical cystectomy, an invasive procedure with high mortality rates.
Atezolizumab and pembrolizumab are both approved first-line agents in the metastatic setting and avelumab is approved as maintenance after first-line chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab furthermore has an indication in NMIBC refractory to BCG therapy, as previously discussed. Therefore, targeting the PD-L1 pathway is a clinically effective strategy in treating bladder cancer, including in the NMIBC, BCG-unresponsive setting.

The bladder cancer market was expected to generate $2.3 billion in revenue in 2021 and is expected to grow to $9.3 billion by 2026. 
Ongoing and planned investigator-initiated trials will provide data that we can use in our own development of IO102-IO103. See Tables 10 and 11 below for additional details on these trials.
Clinical Development in Neo-Adjuvant / Adjuvant Setting
In addition to first-line metastatic cancer indications, we also plan to investigate the dual epitope IO102-IO103 used before or after curatively intended surgery as a neo-adjuvant/adjuvant therapy. We plan to conduct a Phase 2 basket trial, the IOB-032 trial, which will enable us to investigate multiple solid tumor indications in anti PD-1/PD-L1 naïve settings.
Our planned basket trial will investigate the safety and efficacy of IO102-IO103 in combination with anti-PD 1 in each of the below indications:
•Melanoma 
 •SCCHN 
 •Additional indication(s) 
 We plan to first expand the sample size in Phase 2 and then move into a Phase 3 trial in one or more of these indications if a sufficiently strong efficacy signal is observed and the tolerability data are generally consistent with previous clinical trials.
Figure 18: Schematic Clinical Development Diagram
   Additional Trials in Other First-Line Indications and Neo-Adjuvant and Adjuvant Settings
There are multiple potential indication expansion opportunities in various cancer settings with limited anti-PD-1 mAb efficacy or tolerability and toxicity concerns. Both IDO and PD-L1 are highly expressed in numerous other solid tumor indications where anti PD-1-mAb is also approved. Therefore, we believe the potential for the dual epitope IO102-IO103 product candidate in combination with anti PD-1-mAB is significant beyond first-line treatment of advanced melanoma—both as a first-line treatment, but also as a neo-adjuvant (before surgery)/adjuvant (after surgery) therapy. A series of investigator-initiated trials has been completed and others are ongoing that will inform our own development. Safety data from these trials is included in the tables below.
Table 9: Adverse Events Summary of Completed Investigator Initiated Trials
The following table summarizes adverse events reported by the clinical investigators:





Table 10: Ongoing Investigator Initiated Trials


Additionally, the following table describes currently planned investigator-initiated trials.

Table 11: Planned Investigator Initiated Trials


The clinical trials listed in Tables 10 and 11 above are investigator-initiated trials and accordingly we do not have control over the timing of such trials.
 IO102 (IDO)
IO102 is our fully-owned novel product candidate containing a single IDO-derived peptide sequence designed to engage and activate IDO-specific human T cells. This is different from small molecule IDO inhibitors, such as epacadostat, which are designed to block IDO expression on cells. IO102 is the second generation IDO therapy investigated by us. The first IDO therapy we investigated, IO101, is a 9-amino acid peptide investigated in a Phase 1 trial in patients with metastatic NSCLC. The IO101 peptide is an HLA-A2-restricted, IDO-derived CD8+ T cell epitope. IO102 comprises the original CD8+ T cell epitope encoded by IO101 but also contains additional CD8+ T cell epitopes as well as CD4+ T cell epitopes.
Clinical trial testing of IO102 in a randomized Phase 1/2 trial in combination with pembrolizumab standard-of-care in first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC has been completed.
Clinical Development of IO102
As described above, our second generation IDO compound, IO102, is currently being tested in an open-labelled, randomized Phase 1/2 trial in combination with pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC. Continued development of IO102 will be with IO103 and potentially with IO112 and other antigens as part of multiantigen approaches.
IO103 (PD-L1)
IO103 is our fully-owned, novel product candidate containing a single PD-L1-derived peptide designed to engage and activate PD-L1 specific human T cells.
PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 constitute an important immune regulatory pathway. The interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 negatively regulates the proliferation and cytokine production of T cells. Accordingly, cancers upregulate PD-L1 to evade the host immune system and PD-L1 expression is correlated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. PD-L1 expression has been reported for both hematological cancer and solid tumors.
IO103 was tested in a single-arm Phase 2 trial assessing IO103 as a monotherapy in patients with Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) of the skin.
Clinical Development of IO103
IO103 was investigated in a small, mechanism of action focused Phase 2a trial of 10 patients with resectable BCC on a standalone basis. IO103 has previously been investigated in a first in-human study in patients with multiple myeloma and in smoldering myeloma (Tables 9 and 10 above). The primary objective was to investigate objective and relative (%) reduction of the target lesion as well as the tolerability and immunogenicity after treatment with IO103 in patients with BCC.

Ten patients with resectable BCC were treated with up to nine injections. Adverse events observed during each of the trials were grade 1–2 and most of these grade 1-2 adverse events were injection site reactions. One patient had a history of decreased vision due to wet age-related macular degeneration prior to inclusion in the trial. This adverse event was not deemed related to treatment with IO103.
Table 12: Adverse Events by CTCAE Grade and Frequency


Adverse event | Grade 1, n (%) | | Grade 2, n (%) | 
Injection site reaction | 10 (100) | | | — 
Flu-like symptoms after injection | 1 (10) | | | — 
Deterioration of vision due to worsening known age-related macular degeneration | | — | | 1 (10)
Traumatic eye injury | | — | | 1 (10)

 
All patients exhibited peptide specific immune responses in T cells and in skin-infiltrating lymphocytes. IO103’s continued development will be exclusively as part of the dual epitope candidate IO102-IO103 and potentially other dual epitope candidates combined with our antigens or multi-antigen developments.
IO112 (Arginase 1)
IO112 is our fully-owned, novel product candidate containing a single Arginase 1-derived peptide designed to engage and activate Arginase 1-specific human T cells. IO112 is designed to target T cells that recognize epitopes derived from Arginase 1, which is an immunoregulatory enzyme highly expressed in difficult-to-treat tumors associated with high levels of MDSCs including colorectal, breast, prostate and pancreatic and ovarian cancers.
Arginase 1 contributes to immune regulation by catabolizing and limiting the availability of arginine, an essential amino acid for immune effector cell survival and growth. Arginase overproduction by immune suppressive cells like myeloid derived suppressor cells and tolerogenic dendritic cells is a well-documented tumor escape mechanism. Increased levels of arginase have been detected on tumor and immune cells in several solid tumor types.
Preclinical Development
IO112 is designed to selectively engage and activate cancer patients’ own T cells to attack Arginase 1-expressing target cells. Upon activation, T cells secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN and TNF, thereby contributing to immune modulation of microenvironment.
Immunotherapeutic activity of murine Arginase 1 peptide therapy (mIO112) has been observed in multiple Arginase 1-expressing tumor models. Arginase 1 treatment resulted in a concomitant reduction of Arginase 1+ cells and an increased influx of T cells into the TME. The treatment approach enhanced the anti-tumor effect of an anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in a colon adenocarcinoma model, MC38.
Figure 19: Arginase 1 Therapy in Mouse Colon Cancer Model


Treatment combining Arginase 1 therapy and aPD-1 treatment results in synergistic response in a mouse colon cancer model, MC38 (A). In this model, mIO112 treatment (and in combination with aPD-1) results in increased influx of immune cells into TME while promoting enrichment of M1 macrophages (B). In another model (fibrosarcoma, MCA205), increased influx of T cells (CD3 staining) and reduction of Arginase 1-expressing cells in the TME was observed in mice treated with Arginase 1 therapy (ovalbumin (OVA) used as irrelevant peptide control) (C).
Clinical Development of IO112
The next indications that we look to explore are difficult to treat cancers, and therefore ARG-1 was tested in a single-arm first-in-human Phase 1 trial in patients with arginase-positive solid tumors conducted in an investigator-initiated trial at the University of Copenhagen. This was an exploratory safety study to determine if this product can be advanced together with IO102-IO103 or as a component of other multiantigen approaches.
Longer term, we are considering investigating our product candidates in difficult to treat tumors which often express high levels of arginase, such as colorectal, breast, prostate, pancreatic and ovarian cancer. These are all large indications with significant unmet medical need and large commercial potential.
Preclinical Compounds
In addition to IO102, IO103 and IO112, we are evaluating additional potential targets that we believe have potential for use in solid tumors. All our compounds in preclinical development target well-documented immunosuppressive molecules that are known to be overexpressed in the TME across a wide range of tumors. These targets are differentially expressed on tumors compared to normal tissue and cover multiple cancer indications. For example, we are evaluating the potential anti-tumor effect of a novel immune-modulatory cancer therapy using TGF-ß-derived peptides (IO170) in murine tumor models. Transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) is one of the key molecules that contribute to immunosuppression and it is produced in large amounts in the TME by not only cancer cells but also by suppressive and regulatory cells.
Collaborations
Agreements with Herlev University Hospital (Herlev)
 Option Agreements with Herlev
We have entered into a number of agreements with Herlev in Denmark granting us options to acquire certain intellectual property rights related to our programs. The primary agreement governing these rights is Framework Assignment Agreement (the Framework Assignment Agreement) that we entered into with Herlev in May 2016. Under the Framework Assignment Agreement, Herlev grants us options to acquire licenses to data and assignments of patent rights in and to certain inventions related to activating or boosting T cells that react towards regulatory immune cells for the treatment and prevention of cancer (the Field) developed by Drs. Mads Hald Andersen and Inge Marie Svane. We have a period of three months after disclosure by Herlev of any applicable invention to exercise our option with respect to such invention in the Field. Upon exercise of any option, we will negotiate in good faith with Herlev regarding the terms of an assignment agreement for such invention in the Field. If we are unable to agree to terms of such assignment within six months of exercise of the option, Herlev will have no further obligation to continue negotiations with respect to such invention.
The Framework Assignment Agreement will continue until termination by either party. Under the Framework Assignment Agreement, either party may terminate the agreement (1) for convenience, upon six months’ prior written notice or (2) for the other party’s uncured material breach. Termination of the Framework Assignment Agreement for any reason will not affect any assignment agreement entered into prior to such termination.
We have exercised our options granted under the Framework Assignment Agreement, and other option agreements with Herlev, and obtained assignments and licenses related to certain inventions, including inventions related to our lead product candidates, IO102, IO103 and IO112.
Assignment Agreements with Herlev
In January 2015, January 2017 and December 2018, respectively, we exercised options granted by Herlev, and acquired Herlev’s rights and title in and to the patent applications related to Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase based immunotherapies, PD-L1-based immunotherapies and PD-LI peptides for use in cancer vaccines, such as our T-win product candidates, and Arginase specific T cells. In connection with such acquisitions, Herlev has also granted us non-exclusive licenses under any clinical data related to such patent rights arising at Herlev for the purpose of developing and commercializing the inventions and patent rights. The agreements pursuant to which we have obtained these rights and licenses (the Assignment Agreements) are non-terminable.
Pursuant to the Assignment Agreements and other similar agreements with Herlev, we have paid and are obligated to pay future contingent payments and royalties, including upon achieving potential regulatory milestones and low single digit royalties on net sales from sales of products incorporating the acquired patent rights and other revenues arising from the acquired patent rights. Upon the occurrence of a change of control, stock or asset sale or IPO, certain outstanding milestone payments under such agreements became due immediately in the aggregate of approximately DKK 13.2 million (which is approximately $1.9 million based on the exchange rate of DKK 6.95 to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2022). This was triggered by our IPO in November 2021, and has subsequently been paid. We have the right to buy-out all remaining payment obligations under the Assignment Agreement at any time by paying DKK 20 million (for each of the PD-L1 technology and IDO technology) or DKK 10 million (for the Arginase technology) to Herlev.
Under the Assignment Agreements, we control all rights to the covered patents and, with respect to the PD-L1 and Arginase technology, are required to use our best reasonable efforts to manage, prosecute, maintain and enforce, and we are not permitted to abandon, the acquired patent rights certain markets, including Denmark and certain other EU countries, the UK, the US, Canada, Japan and China.
Research Agreements with Herlev
In connection with the Framework Assignment Agreement, we entered into a Framework Cooperation Agreement (the Framework Cooperation Agreement) with Herlev in January 2017, and as amended in December 2018, in which we agreed to cooperate with Herlev, either through co-financed research or sponsored research, for certain agreed-upon research programs to develop therapies aimed at activating or boosting T cells that react towards regulatory immune cells for the treatment and prevention of cancer (the Field). Pursuant to the Framework Cooperation Agreement, we will have the option to acquire all intellectual property rights in inventions developed in the course of any research program, under the terms of the Framework

Assignment Agreement. The Framework Cooperation Agreement does not have a set expiration date, but may be terminated by either party (1) for convenience, upon six months’ prior written notice, or (2) for the other party’s uncured material breach.
Each research program under the Framework Cooperation Agreement will be conducted under a separate cooperation agreement (each, a Cooperation Agreement). We are currently engaged in six co-financed or sponsored research programs in the Field, each under a separate Cooperation Agreement. Each Cooperation Agreement will continue until the completion of the applicable research program, and either party may terminate such Cooperation Agreement, (1) for convenience, upon three months’ prior written notice, or (2) for the other party’s uncured material breach.
Additionally, we have entered into a separate agreement with Herlev pursuant to which we were obligated to pay a cash fee in the amount of DKK 5.0 million (which is approximately $0.7 million based on the exchange rate of DKK 6.95 to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2022) upon the occurrence of a change of control, stock or asset sale or IPO. This was triggered by our IPO in November 2021, and has subsequently been paid.
 Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreements with MSD International GmbH
November 2022 Agreement

 September 2021 Agreement
In September 2021, we entered into an additional Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement (the MSD Agreement) with MSDIG, and MSDIB to collaborate regarding the conduct of our international Phase 3 trial for the Company’s compounds, IO102-IO103, in combination with MSD’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, for the treatment of advanced melanoma (the MSD Study). Each party is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply its compound, at its own cost, for use in the MSD Study. Under the MSD Agreement, we will act as the sponsor of the MSD Study at our cost (except for the cost of the supply of Keytruda from MSD and certain other internal costs incurred by MSD in conducting the MSD Study).
Under the MSD Agreement, all clinical data besides the data arising from the arm of the MSD Study involving only Keytruda will be jointly owned by us and MSD. All inventions relating to the combined use of IO102-IO103 and Keytruda arising from the MSD Study will also be jointly owned by us and MSD. We do not have the right under these jointly owned inventions to research, develop or commercialize any PD-1 antagonist and MSD does not have the right under the jointly owned inventions to research, develop or commercialize any peptide vaccine, such as our T-win product candidates, containing an IDO- or PD-L1-derived peptide. We have the first right to enforce such jointly owned patents. We will own all rights in any inventions or improvements arising from the MSD Study relating solely to or solely covering IO102-IO103 or any a compound that is a peptide vaccine, such as our T-win product candidates, containing an IDO- or PD-L1-derived peptide and MSD will own all rights in any inventions or improvements arising from the MSD Study relating solely to or solely covering Keytruda

or any PD-1 antagonist. The parties agreed that positive clinical data from the MSD Study may be used to obtain label changes for each party’s respective compounds to add an indication for combination therapy.
Under the MSD Agreement, MSD has a limited time right of first negotiation to enter into a definitive agreement with us to develop and commercialize IO102 or IO103. We will be free to negotiate with third parties regarding rights to IO102 or IO103 if MSD does not exercise its right of first negotiation within the exercise period or if the parties are not able to enter into an agreement during the negotiation period.
The MSD Agreement will remain in effect until delivery of the MSD Study’s final analysis by us to MSD, unless terminated earlier by either party: (1) for the other party’s material breach if such party fails to cure such breach within the specified cure period; (2) upon a good faith determination by the terminating party that there is a patient safety concern regarding the MSD Study; (3) if any regulatory authority takes any action that prevents the terminating party from supplying its compound for the MSD Study; (4) if the terminating party determines to withdraw any regulatory approval for its compound or discontinue development of its compound; or (5) for the other party’s failure to comply with its anti-corruption obligations. Upon termination by MSD due to our material breach or our failure to perform any obligations related to anti-corruption laws, we are required to reimburse MSD for the direct and indirect manufacturing costs incurred by MSD in delivering its compound for the MSD Study.
February 2018 Agreement
In February 2018, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement (the Merck Collaboration Agreement) with MSDIG, an affiliate of Merck, to collaborate regarding the conduct of the Company’s international Phase 1/2 trial for the Company’s compound, IO102, in combination with MSDIG’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (the Study). Each party is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply its compound, at its own cost, for use in the Study. Under the Merck Collaboration Agreement, we will act as the sponsor of the Study at our cost (except for the cost of the supply of Keytruda from MSDIG and certain other internal costs incurred by MSDIG in conducting the Study).
Under the Merck Collaboration Agreement, all clinical data arising from the Study and all inventions relating to the combined use of IO102 and Keytruda arising from the Study will be jointly owned by us and MSDIG. We do not have the right under these jointly owned inventions to commercialize any PD-1 antagonist and MSDIG does not have the right under the jointly owned inventions to commercialize any peptide vaccine, such as our T-win product candidates, containing an IDO-derived peptide. The parties are jointly responsible for prosecuting and maintaining the joint patents, and we have the first right to enforce the joint patents. We will own all rights in any inventions or improvements arising from the Study relating solely to or solely covering IO102 or any a compound that is a peptide vaccine, such as our T-win product candidates, containing an IDO-derived peptide and MSDIG will own all rights in any inventions or improvements arising from the Study relating solely to or solely covering Keytruda or any PD-1 antagonist.
During the term of the Merck Collaboration Agreement and for six months thereafter, each party has the option to propose an amendment to the Merck Collaboration Agreement or a new agreement for a registration study for the combination of IO102 and Keytruda for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. If either party makes such a proposal, the other party is obligated to negotiate in good faith the terms of such an amendment or agreement. In addition, we are obligated to offer MSDIG the option of participating in a registration study for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer using IO102 in combination with Keytruda before we enter into an agreement with any third party to conduct a registration study for non-small cell lung cancer for IO102 in combination with a PD-1 antagonist.
The Merck Collaboration Agreement will remain in effect until delivery of the final study report for the Study by the Company, unless terminated by either party: (1) for the other party’s material breach if such party fails to cure such breach within the specified cure period; (2) upon a good faith determination by the terminating party that there is a patient safety concern regarding the Study; (3) if any regulatory authority takes any action that prevents the terminating party from supplying its compound for the Study; (4) if the terminating party determines to withdraw any regulatory approval for its compound or discontinue development of its compound; or (5) for the other party’s failure to comply with its anti-corruption obligations. Upon termination by MSDIG due to our material breach or our failure to perform any obligations related to anti-corruption laws, we are required to reimburse MSDIG for the direct and indirect manufacturing costs incurred by MSDIG in delivering its compound for the Study.
Clinical Trial Research Agreement with Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc
In November 2019, we entered into a Clinical Trial Research Agreement (the Clinical Trial Agreement) with Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc (Saint-Luc) in Belgium in order to conduct an investigator-initiated study regarding the activity and safety of peptide-based immunotherapy in the pre-operative setting for patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (the Saint-Luc Study). The Saint-Luc Study is designed as an umbrella trial enabling the testing of multiple of our compounds, including IO102, IO103 and IO112, after initial testing of IO102 in a monotherapy setting. We are responsible for payment of costs associated with the Saint-Luc Study in accordance with an agreed-upon budget.
Saint-Luc is the sponsor of the Saint-Luc Study and owns all inventions arising from, and data and results generated in, the Saint-Luc Study, and has agreed to grant us an exclusive license to all data and results generated during the Saint-Luc Study. In addition, we have the exclusive right to evaluate, prepare, file, prosecute and maintain patent rights related to any inventions, and we will own all such patented inventions. Saint-Luc is required to take all actions necessary to assign rights in any such patents to us.
The Clinical Trial Agreement will continue for the term of the Saint-Luc Study, unless terminated earlier by either party for convenience or the other party’s material breach, subject to applicable notice and cure periods. In addition, we have the right to terminate the Clinical Trial Agreement for various reasons related to the conduct of the Saint-Luc Study, as specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement.
Competition
Our industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and established collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of cancer immunotherapies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to future product candidates, from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue immune-oncology treatments.
Specifically, there are many companies that commercialize or are developing immuno-oncology treatments for cancer including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as Amgen, AstraZeneca, BMS, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, and Roche's subsidiary Genentech.
In melanoma specifically, the dominant market players are nivolumab, marketed by BMS and Ono, nivolumab & ipilimumab, marketed by BMS and Ono, and pembrolizumab, marketed by Merck. We are also aware of several companies testing their compounds in combination with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. In mid stage development there is Moderna and Merck with an investigational personalized mRNA cancer vaccine, in combination with pembrolizumab. In earlier stage development there are also BioNTech with NEO-PV-01 and Karyopharm with selinexor.
We are not aware of any human peptides targeting the TME that are currently in late stage development for melanoma, NSCLC, bladder cancer or other solid tumors.
Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we may or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. Our competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy, or a combination of such methods. There are a variety of available

drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them.
Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic, including branded generic, products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and gaining a significant share of the market for, any of the product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market may pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.
The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive. If we seek to acquire or license products, we will face substantial competition from a number of more established companies, some of which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products, and many of which are bigger than us and have more institutional experience and greater cash flows than we have. These more established companies may have competitive advantages over us, as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product licenses and/or acquisitions. In addition, a number of established research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may acquire products in late stages of development to augment their internal product lines, which may provide those companies with an even greater competitive advantage.
Manufacturing and Supply
Our compounds are linear peptides formulated as lyophilized powders to ensure long-term shelf-life and reconstituted with water for injection and emulsified with adjuvant prior to subcutaneously administration. The manufacturing process of our compounds has multiple advantages over other immuno-oncology compounds. The manufacturing process is based on a well-understood process solid state peptide synthesis and data has proven our compounds to be stable for a long period at easy-to-administer temperatures. The cost of goods sold for both trials and commercial use is expected to be relatively low.
We currently do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities nor do we have any plans to do so in the foreseeable future. We rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, third-party contract development and manufacturing organizations to continue the development and the optimization of our product candidates and to ensure that suitable manufacturing processes are in place for both present scales and future commercial scales of production of our product candidates. This ensures that all products manufactured under our responsibility are done in accordance with relevant regulatory requirements and approval and includes those product materials intended for use in our preclinical and clinical testing, as well as commercial manufacture.
We believe that our strategy and workforce allow us to maintain an efficient infrastructure and ensure we do not need to invest in expensive manufacturing facilities and equipment. The personnel within the organization enable us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our product candidates and the management of third parties.
To date, we have obtained active pharmaceutical ingredients from qualified facilities with the relevant expertise to manufacture our drug substances. Likewise, suitably qualified facilities with relevant experience have been used to manufacture our drug products. All third parties are assessed under our quality system and appropriate quality agreements to ensure compliance are in place. We maintain agreements with our manufacturers and ensure that confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates are in place.
We are in the process of further optimizing and developing our supply chain for each of our product candidates to ensure continuity of supply and capacity for intended commercial scales.
Commercialization
We hold worldwide development and commercial rights to our pipeline of immuno-oncology programs, and we intend to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, in key geographies. We do not currently have our own marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities. To commercialize IO102-IO103, if approved for commercial sale, we would have to develop a sales and marketing infrastructure.
Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we plan to commence commercialization activities by building a focused sales and marketing organization to sell our products. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of oncologists who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being

developed. We may selectively enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval if we believe these collaborations could maximize the value of our product candidates.
We also plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or assigned from third parties. We own the issued patents and patent applications relating to all compounds in our portfolio. Our policy includes seeking to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications, in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States, directed to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continued innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of immunotherapy. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and supplementary protection certificates / patent term extensions (SPC/PTE) when available. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and know-how; to obtain and maintain licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including any patents that we may own in the future; and to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.

Patents
Our patent portfolio is currently comprised of 17 separate patent families. These are numbered as Families 1 to 17 and are discussed in more detail below. The families are divided into groups based on therapeutic targets. Some of the families span more than one target, particularly with respect to the patents for our lead compounds directed to the target IDO (compound IO102) and target PD-L1 (compound IO103).
•IO102 (IDO): We own five patent families covering compositions of matter and methods of treatment related to IO102, which were filed between 2009-2023. These are Families 1, 2, 3, 13 and 15. 
 •Family 1 is based on an international (PCT) application filed 17 April 2009. Patents granted from this family will expire 17 April 2029 based on a normal 20 year term. In the United States, a granted patent covering IO102 as a composition of matter will expire 7 October 2029 due to a patent term adjustment of 173 days. A separate granted patent in the United States covers methods of treatment using IO102 and will expire 28 May 2029 due to a patent term adjustment of 41 days. A separate pending United States application covers nucleotides encoding IO102 and has received a notice of allowance. A further United States application will be filed shortly to pursue alternative subject matter. In other jurisdictions it is not typically necessary to present claims to compositions of matter separately from methods of treatment and thus both types of claim appear in the same patent. The family includes granted patents in Europe, China, Japan, Canada, Australia, Israel, New Zealand and South Africa, each of which has claims covering IO102 as a compositions of matter and the local equivalent of methods of treatment using IO102. Grant of a corresponding application in Hong Kong is imminent. Each of these patents has the normal 20 year term expiring 17 April 2029. The family also includes pending applications in the United States and European Patent Office (EPO); 
 •Family 2 is based on a PCT application filed 3 March 2017. Patents granted from this family will expire 3 March 2037 based on a normal 20 year term. The family includes pending applications in the United States, Europe and Japan. Claims are directed combined uses of IO102, IO103 and a checkpoint inhibitor; 


•Family 3 is based on a PCT application filed 23 April 2018. Patents granted from this family will expire 23 April 2038 based on a normal 20 year term. The family includes pending applications in the United States, Europe, Japan and China.

 Upon receipt of marketing approvals in each country, we will file applications for supplementary protection certificates/patent term extensions (SPC/PTE) as appropriate. These will provide up to an additional 5 years term of protection with respect to each extended patent, although there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such SPC/PTE. For more information, please see “Risk Factors— If we do not obtain patent term extension in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries under similar legislation, thereby potentially extending the term of marketing exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be harmed.”
Trademark
We hold the trademark T-win in the European Union (Registered no. 017871048), the United States (Registered no. 5754675), China (Registered no. 33152486), Japan (Registered no. 6107125), and the United Kingdom (Registered no. 00917871048). The trademark of T-win is registered in class 5 (including pharmaceuticals and other preparations for medical purposes) and class 42 (including scientific and/or medical research services).
Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, tracking, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biological products such as those we are developing. We, along with our vendors, collaboration partners, contract research organizations (CROs) and CMOs, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of biological products and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In the United States, where we are initially focusing our product development, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drugs, and Cosmetics Act, as amended (FDCA) and the Public Health Service Act, as amended (PHSA) and their implementing regulations. Biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Our product candidates are early-stage and have not been approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States.
Our product candidates must be approved for therapeutic indications by the FDA through a BLA before they may be marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP requirements; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials to be conducted in the U.S. may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made; 


•approval by an IRB or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with GCP requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational biologic for each proposed indication; 
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA, after completion of all pivotal trials; 
 •payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA; 
 •potential review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity and continued safety, purity, and potency; 
 •potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; 
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States; and 
 •compliance with any post-approval commitments and / or requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) or to conduct a post-approval study. 
 Nonclinical and Clinical Trials
Nonclinical Trials
Before testing any biologic product in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous nonclinical testing in vitro and in vivo. Such nonclinical in vitro and in vivo animal studies assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of nonclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety and toxicology studies. The results of the nonclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, a proposed clinical trial protocol, and analytical data must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND prior to the start of clinical studies in humans. However, some long-term nonclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap.
•Phase 1—Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion of the investigational product in humans, evaluate the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness; 
 •Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Phase 1 trials are sometimes combined with Phase 2 trials. These trials are known as Phase 1/2 trials. Generally, a Phase 1/2 trial is conducted as a single trial that has the characteristics of both a Phase 1 trial (as described above) and a Phase 2 trial. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 trials may be conducted as basket trials where a single investigational drug or drug combination is studied across multiple cancer populations defined by disease stage, histology, number of prior therapies, genetic or other biomarkers, or demographic characteristics; and 
 •Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for approval. Accordingly, these are generally known as registrational trials. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA. 


Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional information regarding risks, benefits, and optimal use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA.
Investigational New Drug — Authorization to Conduct Clinical Trials in US
An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational biologic product to humans and to ship such products in interstate commerce for use in investigational clinical trials. INDs must become effective before clinical trials in the U.S. may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, carcinogenicity, formulation, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product; and a proposed clinical trial protocol.
The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt of the submission by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development of a product candidate, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection, and exclusion criteria, and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonably related to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. Information about applicable clinical trials, including clinical trials results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human participants exposed to the drug or biological product, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if, among other things, the study was conducted in accordance with GCP, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
FDA Review Process
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications must be submitted to FDA. A BLA is a request for approval to market a new biological product for one or more specified indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators not from the company. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity, and potency of the investigational biological product, to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a product may be marketed in the United States.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) certain BLAs and certain supplements to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (iPSP) within 60 days after an End-of-Phase 2 meeting or such other time as agreed upon between FDA and the sponsor. If no End-of-Phase 2 meeting occurs, the iPSP should be submitted as soon as practicable but before initiation of Phase 3 studies, or within 210 calendar days in advance of a marketing application if a Phase 3 study, or a combined Phase 2 and Phase 3 study, will not be conducted or will be conducted but not under IND. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to a product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the application. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure continued safety, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended (PDUFA) the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA filed for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority BLAs, and the review process may be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Further, under the PDUFA, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions may be available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first BLA filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product applicant also seeks approval for a non-orphan indication.
The FDA may refer an application for a biologic product to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP, and other requirements, and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) as a condition for approving the BLA to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk-minimization tools.
After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or,

in some cases, a Complete Response Letter. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter will usually describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, and the FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted production lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a biologic product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may limit the approved indications for use, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the approved labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation (ODD) to a biologic product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with either a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biological product in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States of that drug or biological product. ODD must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its orphan designation are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
A product that has received ODD and subsequently is the first FDA approved biologic product for the disease for which it has such designation, is entitled to orphan product exclusivity for the approved indication. The designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. Orphan exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years from the date of approval of the BLA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan product to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the product was approved. Orphan exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biological product for the same disease or condition, or the same product for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of ODD are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.
A product that has received ODD may not receive orphan exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received ODD. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of the patients with the rare disease or condition.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new biologic products to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track Designation (FTD), Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD), Priority Review (PR) and Accelerated Approval (AA).
A new biologic product is eligible for FTD if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. FTD applies to the biologic product, or combination of drugs and biologic products, and the specific indication for which it is being studied. FTD may provide increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission

of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. FDA may revoke the FTD if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
In addition, a new biologic product may be eligible for BTD if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biological product, alone or in combination with or more other biologic products, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. BTD provides all the features of FTD in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review and regulatory staff in a proactive, collaborative, cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Any biologic product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with FTD, or BTD, may also be eligible for priority review. A product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. For original BLAs, PR Designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review).
In addition, biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of such product receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. Products granted AA must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for AA pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. FTD, BTD, PR, and AA do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval but may expedite the development or review process.
U.S. Post-Approval Requirements
Biological products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (off-label use) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of a BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, product manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which imposes certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our CMOs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, and civil or criminal penalties. There is also a continuing, annual program fee for any marketed product.

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; 
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information; 
 •fines, warning letters, or untitled letters; 
 •holds on clinical trials; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and 
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs. 
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA) includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies, unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services waives a required element. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product, and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biological product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference product. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biosimilar products.
A reference product is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a BLA for the competing product containing that sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the other company’s product.

At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed interchangeable by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study, requested by the Secretary, in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. However, extensions are not applicable if made later than 9 months prior to the expiration of such period.
Other Regulatory Matters
As further described below, manufacturing, sales, commercialization and promotion of product candidates following product approval and other related activities of the company, where applicable, are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
Other Healthcare Laws
Physicians, other healthcare providers, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, an intent-based, federal criminal statute which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bride, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. Further, courts have found that if “one purpose” of the remuneration is to induce referrals, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is violated. Violations may be subject to significant civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute applies to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and individuals, such as prescribers, patients, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other hand, including, for example, consulting/speaking arrangements, discount and rebate offers, grants, charitable contributions, and patient support offerings, among others. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute that protect certain common industry activities from prosecution, these exceptions and safe harbors are narrowly drawn and arrangements may be subject to scrutiny or penalty if they do not fully satisfy all elements of an available exception or safe harbor; 
 •The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act (FCA), which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the FDCA, federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or other law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring qui tam actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery or settlement. Violations of the FCA may be subject to significant civil fines 


and penalties for each false claim, treble damages, and potential exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs;
•The federal civil monetary penalties laws, which impose significant civil fines against individuals and entities that engage in activities including, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a claim for services not provided as claimed or that is otherwise false or fraudulent in any way; arranging for or contracting with an individual or entity that is excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs to provide items or services reimbursable by a federal healthcare program; violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; failing to report and return a known overpayment; or offering or transferring any remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of items or services reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid, unless an exception applies; 
 •The federal criminal statutes enacted under HIPAA, which impose criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program; knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program; willfully preventing, obstructing, misleading, or delaying a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense; and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH"), and their respective implementing regulations, imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. The Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has recently increased its enforcement efforts on compliance with HIPAA, including its security regulations, and bringing actions against entities and business associates for failure to implement required security measures to protect electronic protected health information or to conduct a thorough risk assessment, among other violations;
•The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the ACA, which imposes annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to U.S.-licensed physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants, certified nurse midwives, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 
 •Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party-payors, including private insurers, and may be broader in scope than their federal equivalents; state and foreign laws requiring pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws and regulations that require disclosures to state agencies and/or commercial purchasers with respect to certain price increases that exceed a certain level as identified in the relevant statutes; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances and which may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA and may therefore complicate compliance efforts. 


The full scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. Federal and state enforcement bodies have continued to increase their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices, including certain arrangements with physicians who receive stock, warrants, or stock options as compensation for services provided to us, do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from its business.
Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients and healthcare providers are unlikely to use our products unless third-party payor coverage is provided and reimbursement by such payor is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other comparable government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product.
Pursuant to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Statute, we will be required to participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program in order for federal payment to be available for our products under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Medicaid is a government health insurance program for eligible low-income adults, children, families, pregnant women, and people with certain disabilities. It is jointly funded by the federal and state governments, and it is administered by individual states within parameters established by the federal government. As a result, coverage and reimbursement requirements for drugs and biologics vary by state. For example, drugs and biologics may be covered under the medical or pharmacy benefit, and state Medicaid programs may impose different utilization management controls, such as prior authorization, step therapy, or quantity limits on drugs and biologics, subject to federal limitations for such controls. But all states must generally provide coverage and reimbursement for a manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs, as that term is defined by applicable law, if a manufacturer participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we will be required to, among other things, pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for quantities of our products utilized on an outpatient basis (with some exceptions) that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program. Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates are calculated using a statutory formula, state-reported utilization data, and pricing data that are calculated and reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of single source and innovator multiple source products, the best price for each drug.
In addition to participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, federal law requires manufacturers to participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities only include health care organizations that have certain federal designations or receive funding from specific federal programs, including Federally Qualified Health Centers, Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program grantees, and certain types of hospitals and specialized clinics, as well as certain hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The Affordable Care Act expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities: certain children’s hospitals, certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, certain rural referral centers and certain sole community hospitals, each as defined by the ACA. However, “orphan drugs” i.e., those designated under section 526 of the FDCA are exempted from the ceiling price requirements for these eligible entities added by the ACA (except for certain children’s hospitals). The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and in general,

products subject to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement.
In addition, after multiple delays, the final rule implementing civil monetary penalties against manufacturers for instances of overcharging 340B covered entities became effective on January 1, 2019. Accordingly, if we have an approved product, we could be subject to such penalties if the government were to find that we knowingly and intentionally overcharged a 340B covered entity.
 Federal law requires that for a company to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs as well as to be purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, it also must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) pricing program. To participate, we will be required to enter into an FSS contract and other agreements with the VA for our products, which may qualify as “covered drugs.” Under these agreements, we would need to make our products available to the “Big Four” federal agencies—the VA, the Department of Defense (DoD), the Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service), and the Coast Guard—at prices that are capped pursuant to a statutory federal ceiling price, or FCP, formula set forth in Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended (VHCA). The FCP is based on a weighted average non-federal average manufacturer price (Non-FAMP), which manufacturers are required to report on a quarterly and annual basis to the VA. Pursuant to the VHCA, knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject a manufacturer to a penalty for each item of false information and could result in other potential liability as well, including liability under the False Claims Act.
 FSS contracts are federal procurement contracts that include standard government terms and conditions, separate pricing for each product, and extensive disclosure and certification requirements. All items on FSS contracts are subject to a standard FSS contract clause that requires FSS contract price reductions under certain circumstances where pricing is reduced to an agreed “tracking customer.” Further, in addition to the “Big Four” federal agencies, all other federal agencies and some non-federal entities are authorized to purchase off FSS contracts. FSS contractors are permitted to charge FSS purchasers other than the Big Four agencies “negotiated pricing” for covered drugs that is not capped by the FCP, and such pricing is negotiated based on a mandatory disclosure of the contractor’s commercial “most favored customer” pricing.
In addition, pursuant to regulations issued by the DoD to implement Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, each of our covered drugs will be listed on an agreement with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) under which we will agree to honor the “Big Four” pricing for our products when they are dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE retail network pharmacies. More specifically, we will agree to provide rebates (or refunds) on such utilization. Companies are required to enter into a DHA Agreement for “covered drug” products in order for the covered drug to be eligible for DoD formulary inclusion and available to TRICARE beneficiaries without preauthorization. The formula for determining the rebate is established in the regulations and our DHA agreement and is based on the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and the FCP (as described above, these price points are required to be calculated by us under the VHCA).
In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, with commercial payors, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for, examining the medical necessity of, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. They are also increasingly imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, for products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself may or may not be available. Instead, the hospital or administering physician may be reimbursed only for providing the treatment or procedure in which our product is used.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products

on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party coverage and reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to cover our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. It is difficult to predict how Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies will be applied to products for which the company receives marketing approval in the future and coverage and reimbursement under different federal healthcare programs is not always consistent. Further, private payors often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies established under Medicare. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products for which we receive marketing approval.
 Healthcare Reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, included changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. The ACA included provisions of importance to our potential product candidate that:
•created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 
 •expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 138% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; 
 •expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices; 
 •addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 
 •expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; and
 •created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law, including the repeal, effective January 1, 2019, of the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states who argued that, without the individual mandate, the entire ACA was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court’s dismissal of the lawsuit did not specifically rule on the constitutionality of the ACA. It

is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the ACA or our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted to reduce healthcare expenditures. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional congressional action is taken, with the exception of a temporary suspension by Congress of the 2% cut in Medicare payments from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, with a 1% cut in Medicare payments in effect from March 31, 2022 to July 1, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes under new healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, which has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 were several drug price reporting and transparency measures, such as a new requirement for certain Medicare plans to develop tools to display Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit information in real time and for group and health insurance issuers to report information on pharmacy benefit and drug costs to the Secretaries of HHS, Labor and the Treasury. Moreover, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), which implements substantial changes to the Medicare program, including drug pricing reforms and the creation of new Medicare inflation rebates. Namely, the IRA imposes inflation rebates on drug manufacturers for products reimbursed under Medicare Parts B and D if the prices of those products increase faster than inflation; implements changes to the Medicare Part D benefit that, beginning in 2025, will cap beneficiary annual out-of-pocket spending at $2,000, while imposing new discount obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers; and, beginning in 2026, establishes a “maximum fair price” for a fixed number of high expenditure pharmaceutical and biological products covered under Medicare Parts B and D following a price negotiation process with CMS. On October 14, 2022, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Lowering Prescription Drug Costs for Americans, which instructed the Secretary of HHS to consider whether to select for testing by the CMS Innovation Center new health care payment and delivery models that would lower drug costs and promote access to innovative drug therapies for beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Most recently, on February 14, 2023, HHS issued a report in response to the October 14, 2022 Executive Order, which, among other things, selects three potential drug affordability and accessibility models to be tested by the CMS Innovation Center. Specifically, the report addresses: (1) a model that would allow Part D Sponsors to establish a “high-value drug list” setting the maximum co-payment amount for certain common generic drugs at $2.00; (2) a Medicaid-focused model that would establish a partnership between CMS, manufacturers, and state Medicaid agencies that would result in multi-state outcomes-based agreements or certain cell and gene therapy drugs; and (3) a model that would adjust Medicare Part B payment amounts for Accelerated Approval Program drugs to advance the developments of novel treatments. We expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the extent to which the U.S. federal government covers particular healthcare products and services and could limit the amounts that the U.S. federal government will pay for healthcare products and services. This could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. At the state level, individual states have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize any product that is ultimately approved, if approved.
On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government

authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its EU Member States to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU Member States may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced EU Member States, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
Compliance with Other Federal and State Laws or Requirements; Changing Legal Requirements
If any products that we may develop are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, among other requirements to we may be subject.
Further, the distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements may subject us to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, relabeling or repackaging, or refusal to allow a company to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any claim or action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on marketing, sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our sales and manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling or packaging; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
European Union Drug Development
In the EU, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a Marketing Authorization (MA) from a competent regulatory authority has been obtained and additionally, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.
European Union Clinical Trials
For example, in the EU, a clinical trial application (CTA) must be submitted to each EU Member State’s competent authority and an independent ethics committee, similar to the FDA and the IRB, respectively. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Once the CTA is approved by the EU Member State’s competent authority and the ethics committee has granted a positive opinion in relation to the conduct of the trial in the relevant Member State(s), in accordance with an EU Member State’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and EU Member State regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines on GCP, as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Additional GCP guidelines from the European Commission, focusing in particular on traceability, apply to clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an entity within the EU to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU Member States, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
In the European Union, or the EU, the Clinical Trials Regulation ((EU) No 536/2014) applied since 31 January 2022, replacing and repealing the Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC). Under the Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, there is a centralized application procedure where one EU Member State’s competent authority takes the lead in reviewing part I of the application, which contains scientific and medicinal product documentation, and the other national authorities only have limited involvement. Part II, which contains the national and patient-level documentation, will be assessed individually by each EU Member State. A clinical trial can only start in an EU Member State once it has been authorized (potentially with conditions) by the concerned EU Member State via the EU Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS). Separately, the sponsor must obtain a positive opinion from the relevant, independent Ethics Committee(s). A transitional period will apply during the transition from Clinical Trials Directive to the Clinical Trials Regulation, During this period, the following applies: (a) from January 31, 2023, clinical trial sponsors will need to use CTIS to apply to start a new clinical trial in the EU/EEA; and (b) from January 31, 2025, any trials approved under the Clinical Trials Directive that continue running will need to comply with the Clinical Trials Regulation and their sponsors must have recorded information on them in the CTIS.
 Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the CTA must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with GMP. Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
During the development of a medicinal product, the EMA and EU Member States’ competent authorities provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the CHMP. A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical trials, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future MAA of the product concerned.
We are in the process of applying to renew our status with the EMA as a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME). If we are successful in maintaining our current SME status with the EMA, it will provide access to administrative, regulatory and financial support, including fee reductions for scientific advice and regulatory procedures.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the European Union, medicinal products can only be placed on the market after obtaining a MA. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product in the EU, we must submit an MAA. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product. 
The centralized procedure results in a single MA, issued by the European Commission (based on the opinion of the EMA), which is valid across the entire territory of the EU. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (1) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (2) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (3) designated orphan medicines and/or (4) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may, at the request of the applicant, also be

used in certain other cases. Therefore, the centralized procedure would be mandatory for the products we are developing. 
The CAT is responsible in conjunction with the CHMP for the evaluation of ATMPs. The CAT is primarily responsible for the scientific evaluation of ATMPs and prepares a draft opinion on the quality, safety and efficacy of each ATMP for which a MAA is submitted. The CAT’s opinion is taken into account by the CHMP when giving its final recommendation regarding the authorization of a product in view of the balance of benefits and risks identified. Although the CAT’s draft opinion is submitted to the CHMP for final approval, the CHMP may depart from the draft opinion, if it provides detailed scientific justification. The CHMP and CAT are also responsible for providing guidelines on ATMPs and have published numerous guidelines, including specific guidelines on gene therapies and cell therapies. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of ATMPs and include, among other things, the preclinical studies required to characterize ATMPs; the manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a MAA; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long term efficacy and potential adverse reactions of ATMPs.
Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days. This excludes so-called clock stops, during which additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the EMA. At the end of the review period, the EMA provides an opinion to the European Commission. If this opinion is favorable, the European Commission may then adopt a decision to grant an MA.
MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period unless the European Commission or the EU Member States’ competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal.
In exceptional cases, the EMA might perform an accelerated review of an MAA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme, which provides incentives similar to BTD in the U.S. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is however not guaranteed. The benefits of a PRIME designation include the appointment of a rapporteur from the EMA before submission of an MAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review earlier in the application process.
The European Commission may grant a so-called “conditional marketing authorization” prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full MA. Such conditional MAs may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products), if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive; (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data; (3) the product fulfills an unmet medical need; and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional MA may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the MA holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies and the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional MAs are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually if the risk-benefit balance remains positive and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The MA can be converted into a standard MA once the MA holder fulfils the obligations that were imposed and the complete data confirm that the medicine’s benefits continue to outweigh its risks. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the EMA of applications for a conditional MA.
The European Commission may also grant a so-called “marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances.” Such MA is intended for products for which the applicant can demonstrate that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use even after the product has been authorized because (1) the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence; (2) in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided; or

(3) it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information. Consequently, MAs under exceptional circumstances may be granted subject to certain specific obligations, which may include the following:
•the applicant must complete an identified program of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile; 
 •the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case of a radio-pharmaceutical, by an authorized person; and 
 •the package leaflet and any medical information must draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particulars available concerning the medicinal product in question are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects. 
 An MA under exceptional circumstances is subject to annual review to reassess the risk-benefit balance in an annual reassessment procedure. Continuation of the authorization is linked to the annual reassessment and a negative assessment could potentially result in the MA being suspended or revoked. The renewal of a MA of a medicinal product under exceptional circumstances, however, follows the same rules as a “normal” MA. Thus, a MA under exceptional circumstances is granted for an initial five years, after which the authorization will become valid indefinitely, unless the EMA decides that safety grounds merit one additional five-year renewal. A MA under exceptional circumstances should not be granted when a conditional MA is more appropriate.
The European Union medicines rules expressly permit the EU Member States to adopt national legislation prohibiting or restricting the sale, supply or use of any medicinal product containing, consisting of or derived from a specific type of human or animal cell, such as embryonic stem cells. While the products we have in development do not make use of embryonic stem cells, it is possible that the national laws in certain EU Member States may prohibit or restrict us from commercializing our products, even if they have been granted an MA.
European Union Data and Marketing Exclusivity
The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. MAAs for generic medicinal products do not need to include the results of preclinical and clinical trials, but instead can refer to the data included in the MA of a reference product for which regulatory data exclusivity has expired. Upon receiving an MA, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year market exclusivity period may be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
European Union Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Products receiving orphan drug designation in the EU can receive ten years of market exclusivity once they are authorized as orphan medicines. During the ten-year market exclusivity period, the EMA cannot accept another application for a MA, or grant a MA or accept an application to extend an existing MA, for the same therapeutic indication, in respect of a similar medicinal product. An orphan medicinal product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States. A medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the MAA. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the MAA if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the

time the MA is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, a MA may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if:
(1)the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; 
 (2)the holder of the MA for the original orphan medicinal product has given its consent to the second applicant; or 
 (3)the holder of the MA for the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the medicinal product. 
 Post-Approval Requirements
Similar to the United States, both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the EU Member States’ competent authorities. The holder of an MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, (PSURs).
All new MAAs must include a RMP describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
Failure to comply with EU and EU Member State laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MAs of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA; manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
European Union Drug Marketing
The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU Directives, the details are governed by regulations in each EU Member State and can differ from one country to another.
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statue prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to healthcare professionals to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti-bribery rules of EU Member States. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
Payments made to healthcare professionals in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with healthcare professionals often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the healthcare professional’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative or criminal penalties, including fines, or imprisonment.
Pricing and Reimbursement
Even if a medicinal product obtains a MA in the EU, there can be no assurance that reimbursement for such product will be secured on a timely basis or at all. Governments influence the price of medicinal products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. EU Member States are free to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, and to control the prices and reimbursement levels of pharmaceutical products for human use. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. EU Member States may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product, or alternatively adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the pharmaceutical product on the market, including volume-based arrangements, caps and reference pricing mechanisms. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials in order to compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other EU Member States may allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. In December 2021, Regulation (EU) 2021/2282 on HTA (the “HTA Regulation”) was adopted. The HTA Regulation will apply beginning on January 12, 2025. It replaces the current system based on the voluntary network of national authorities, and the new framework covers joint clinical assessments, joint scientific consultations, the identification of emerging health technologies, and voluntary cooperation for the national authorities. The HTA Regulation aims to provide a transparent and inclusive framework for health technology assessments in the EU, and it will help EU countries determine the effectiveness and value of new technologies and decide on pricing and reimbursement by health insurers or health systems.
 European Pediatric Investigation Plan
In the EU, MAAs for new medicinal products must generally include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan (PIP) agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (PDCO). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which an MA is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the medicinal product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the MA is obtained in all Member States of the EU and trial results are included in the product information, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension.
European Data Collection
The collection and use of personal data (including health data) in the EEA is governed by the EU General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and national implementing legislation in EEA States. The EU GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The EU GDPR establishes stringent requirements applicable to the processing of personal data, including strict requirements relating to the validity of consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct data protection impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, special provisions for the processing of “special categories of personal data” including health and genetic information of data subjects, mandatory data breach notification (in certain circumstances), “privacy by design” requirements, and direct obligations on service providers acting as processors. The EU GDPR also prohibits the international transfer of personal data from the EEA to countries outside of the EEA unless made to a country deemed to have adequate data privacy laws by the European Commission or a data transfer mechanism has been put in place. Failure to comply with the requirements of the EU GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA States may result in fines up to €20 million or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the EU GDPR affords various data protection rights to individuals (e.g., the right to erasure of personal data) in certain circumstances, and the ability for data subjects to claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringements of the EU GDPR. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, maintaining compliance with the EU GDPR, will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the evolving data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. These requirements and risks are set out in further detail in the section of this annual report titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry and

Business Operations—We are subject to a variety of privacy and data security laws, and our failure to comply with them could harm our business.”
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the EU (or in some cases, EEA) and the United States, such as the United Kingdom, countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 57 full-time employees, 23 of whom have Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. Of these full-time employees, 42 employees are engaged in research and development activities and 15 employees are engaged in finance, legal, human resources, facilities and general management. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our employees. We also place a high value on the diversity of our team – including gender, background and expertise – to foster our culture of innovation. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to align the interests of our stockholders and those eligible for awards, to retain and incentivize officers, directors, employees, and other service providers, and to encourage them to act in our long-term best interests. We value our employees and regularly evaluate total compensation we provide, including pension contributions paid time off personal leave and other benefits, to ensure we remain competitive and attractive to potential new hires.
Facilities
We lease a facility containing approximately 622 square meters of office space for our main office, which is located at COBIS, Ole Maaloes Vej 3, 2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark. The lease expires on December 31, 2027. We also lease lab space at COBIS, Ole Maaloes Vej 3, 2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark. The initial lease expired on December 31, 2022 and a new lease commenced on January 1, 2023, which expires on December 31, 2027.
 In the United States, we lease a facility in New York for office space, located at 430 East 29th Street, New York, New York, and a facility in Maryland for lab space, located at 5640 Fishers Lane, Suite C, Rockville, Maryland. The New York lease expires on February 28, 2027 and the Maryland lease expires on March 31, 2027.
