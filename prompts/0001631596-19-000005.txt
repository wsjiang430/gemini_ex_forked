ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
KREF is a real estate finance company that focuses primarily on originating and acquiring senior loans secured by institutional-quality commercial real estate ("CRE") properties that are owned and operated by experienced and well-capitalized sponsors and located in liquid markets with strong underlying fundamentals. Our target assets also include mezzanine loans, preferred equity and other debt-oriented instruments with these characteristics. Our investment objective is capital preservation and the generation of attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over the long term, primarily through dividends.
We began our investment activities in October 2014 with an initial commitment of $400.0 million from KKR. We raised an additional $438.1 million in equity commitments from third-party investors and certain current and former employees of, and consultants to, KKR that brought our total committed capital base to $838.1 million, which was fully drawn prior to our initial public offering ("IPO") that generated net proceeds of $225.9 million on May 5, 2017. We had a book value of $1,132.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and established a portfolio of diversified investments, consisting of performing senior loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") B-Pieces, which had a value of $4,133.5 million. 
We are organized as a holding company externally managed by our Manager, an indirect subsidiary of KKR & Co. Inc., and operate our business primarily through various subsidiaries in a single segment that originates, acquires, and finances our target assets.
We conduct our operations as a REIT for federal income tax purposes while seeking to avoid registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the "Investment Company Act"). We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on the portion of our annual net taxable income that we distribute to stockholders if we maintain our qualification as a REIT.
We are traded on the NYSE under the symbol “KREF.” We were incorporated in Maryland on October 2, 2014, and our principal executive offices are located at 9 West 57th Street, New York, New York.
Our Manager and KKR
We are externally managed by our Manager, an indirect subsidiary of KKR & Co. Inc. ("KKR"), a leading global investment firm with a 40-year history of leadership, innovation and investment excellence. KKR manages multiple alternative asset classes including private equity, energy, infrastructure, real estate, and credit, with strategic manager partnerships that manage hedge funds. KKR is listed on the NYSE (NYSE: KKR) and reported $194.7 billion of assets under management ("AUM") as of December 31, 2018. KKR's "One-Firm" culture encourages collaboration and leveraging resources and relationships across KKR to help find creative solutions for clients seeking capital and strategic partnerships. We believe our Manager's relationship with KKR and its differentiated global investment management platform provides us with significant advantages in sourcing, evaluating, underwriting and managing our investments.
In connection with the performance of its duties, our Manager benefits from the resources, relationships and expertise of KKR's real estate group ("KKR Real Estate"), which provides equity and debt capital across a variety of real estate sectors and strategies. Established in 2011 under the leadership of Ralph F. Rosenberg, Global Head of KKR Real Estate and Chairman of our board of directors, KKR Real Estate had $6.3 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2018. Mr. Rosenberg, who has 30 years of real estate equity and debt transaction experience, is supported at KKR Real Estate by a team of approximately 70 dedicated professionals across nine offices globally. We believe that KKR Real Estate's global relationships with property owners, managers, lenders, brokers and advisors and real-time knowledge derived from its broadly diversified real estate holdings provide our Manager with access to sourcing channels as well as operational and strategic insights to help our Manager evaluate and monitor individual investment opportunities. Additionally, our Manager leverages the proprietary information available to us through KKR's global investment platforms to conduct thorough underwriting and due diligence and develop a deeper understanding of the opportunities, risks and challenges of the investments that we review. Further, our Manager benefits from KKR Credit & Markets, comprised of a team of over 36 investment professionals that advise KKR's investment teams and portfolio companies on executing equity and debt capital markets solutions.
Our Manager is led by an experienced team of senior real estate investment professionals, including Christen E.J. Lee and Matthew A. Salem, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Co-Presidents, and W. Patrick Mattson, our Chief Operating Officer, 
who collectively average over 19 years of CRE experience. Our Manager's senior leadership team is supported by 14 other investment professionals with significant expertise in executing our investment strategy. Our Manager's investment committee, which is comprised of Messrs. Rosenberg, Lee, Salem, Mattson, Roger Morales, Head of KKR's Real Estate Acquisitions Americas, Justin Pattner, Head of KKR's Real Estate Equity Americas and Billy Butcher, Chief Operating Officer of KKR's Global Real Estate, advises and consults with our Manager and its investment professionals with respect to our investment strategy, portfolio construction, financing and investment guidelines and risk management and approves all of our investments. 
Our Investment Strategy
Our investment strategy is to originate or acquire senior loans collateralized by institutional-quality CRE assets that are owned and operated by experienced and well-capitalized sponsors and located in liquid markets with strong underlying fundamentals. We also intend to invest in mezzanine loans, preferred equity and other debt-oriented instruments with these characteristics. Through our Manager, we have access to KKR's integrated, global real estate investment platform and its established sourcing, underwriting and structuring capabilities to develop our own view on value and evaluate and structure credit risk from an owner's and a lender's perspective. In addition, we believe that we benefit from our access to KKR's global network and real estate and other investment holdings, which provide our Manager with access to information and market data that is not available to many of our competitors. In many instances, we are able to make investments where we believe we have a sourcing, underwriting or execution advantage by leveraging the KKR brand, industry knowledge and proprietary relationships. 
We pursue opportunities for which we believe that we are lending at a substantial discount to our Manager's view of intrinsic real estate value, which our Manager substantiates through an independent assessment of value. We also seek investment opportunities where there is the potential to increase the value of the underlying loan collateral through improving property management or implementing strategic capital improvement initiatives, and as such, focus on lending to sponsors with histories of successful execution in their respective asset classes or markets. Additionally, we endeavor to make loans with covenants and structural features that align the incentives of us and our borrowers to the extent that the operating performance of the underlying collateral deteriorates.
Our financing strategy and investment process are discussed in more detail in "—Our Financing Strategy" and "—Investment Guidelines" below.
Our Target Assets
Our target assets primarily include senior loans, as well as mezzanine loans, preferred equity and other debt-oriented investments:

• | Senior Loans—We focus on originating and acquiring senior loans that are backed by CRE properties. These loans are secured by real estate and evidenced by a first-priority mortgage. The loans may vary in duration, bear interest at a fixed or floating rate and amortize, and typically require a balloon payment of principal at maturity, but are typically anticipated to be floating rate and shorter-term duration. These investments may include whole loans or pari passu participations within such senior loans.


• | Mezzanine Loans—We may syndicate senior participations in our originated senior loans to other investors and retain a subordinated debt position for our portfolio, typically a mezzanine loan. We may also directly originate or acquire mezzanine loans. These are loans (including pari passu participations in such loans) made to the owner of a mortgage borrower and secured by a pledge of equity interests in the mortgage borrower. These loans are subordinate to a senior loan, but senior to the owner's equity. These loans may be tranched into senior and junior mezzanine loans, with the junior mezzanine lenders secured by a pledge of the equity interests in the more senior mezzanine borrower. The mezzanine lender typically has additional rights as compared to the more senior lenders, including the right to cure defaults under the senior loan and any senior mezzanine loan and purchase the senior loan and any senior mezzanine loan, in each case under certain circumstances following a default on the senior loan. Following a default on a mezzanine loan, and subject to negotiated terms with the mortgage lender or other mezzanine lenders, the mezzanine lender generally has the right to foreclose on its equity interest and become the owner of the property, directly or indirectly, subject to the lien of the senior loan and any other debt senior to it including any outstanding senior mezzanine loans.


• | Preferred Equity—We may make investments that are subordinate to any mortgage or mezzanine loan, but senior to the common equity of the mortgage borrower or owner of a mortgage borrower, as applicable. Preferred equity investments typically pay a preferred return from the investment's cash flow rather than interest payments and often have the right for such preferred return to accrue if there is insufficient cash flow for current payment. These interests

are not secured by the underlying real estate, but upon the occurrence of a default, the preferred equity provider typically has the right to effect a change of control with respect to the ownership of the property. 

• | CMBS B-Pieces (New Issue)—We may also make investments that consist of below investment-grade bonds comprising some or all of the BB-rated, B-rated and unrated tranches of a CMBS securitization pool. The underlying loans are typically aggregated into a pool and sold as securities to different investors. Under the pooling and servicing agreements that govern these pools, the loans are administered by a trustee and servicers, who act on behalf of all investors and distribute the underlying cash flows to the different classes of securities in accordance with their seniority. The below-investment grade securities that comprise each CMBS B-Piece have generally in the past been acquired in aggregate. Due to their first loss position, these investments are typically offered at a discount to par. These investments typically carry a 10-year weighted average life due to prepayment restrictions. We generally intend to hold these investments through maturity, but may, from time to time, opportunistically sell positions should liquidity become available or be required. Under the risk retention rules under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") that went into effect in December 2016, CMBS B-Piece investments may also include BBB-rated securities and are subject to certain additional restrictions that, among other things, prohibit hedging CMBS B-Pieces or selling CMBS B-Pieces for a period of at least five years from the date the investment was made. We currently make CMBS B-Piece investments indirectly through our investment in an aggregator vehicle alongside KKR Real Estate Credit Opportunity Partners L.P. ("RECOP"), a KKR-managed investment fund. See Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Our Portfolio."


• | Other Real Estate Securities—We may make investments in real estate that take the form of CMBS (other than CMBS B-Pieces) or Collateralized Loan Obligations ("CLO") that are collateralized by pools of real estate debt instruments, often senior loans. We may also acquire the debt securities of other REITs or other entities engaged in real estate operating or financing activities, but generally not for the purpose of exercising control over such entities.

Our Portfolio
We began operations in October 2014 and have established a portfolio of diversified investments, consisting of performing senior loans, mezzanine loans and CMBS B-Pieces, which had a value of $4,133.5 million as of December 31, 2018, a 98% increase compared to 2017. We believe our current portfolio, comprised of target assets representative of our investment philosophy, validates our ability to execute on our stated market opportunity and investment strategy, including lending against high-quality real estate in liquid markets with strong fundamentals to experienced and well-capitalized sponsors. As we continue to scale our portfolio, we expect that our originations will continue to be heavily weighted toward floating-rate loans. We expect the majority of our future investment activity to focus on originating floating-rate senior loans that we finance with our repurchase facilities, asset based financing, term loan financing and collateralized loan obligations, with a secondary focus on originating floating-rate loans for which we syndicate a senior position and retain a subordinated interest for our portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio had experienced no impairments and did not contain any legacy assets that were originated prior to October 2014. As of December 31, 2018, all of our investments were located in the United States. 
The following charts illustrate the growth in our portfolio, origination volume, average loan size originated, net income and book value, as well as the compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") over the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 (dollars in millions):
The map below illustrates the geographic distribution of the properties securing our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018:
The following charts illustrate the diversification of our portfolio, based on type of investment, interest rate, underlying property type, geographic location, vintage and loan to value as of December 31, 2018:
The charts above are based on total assets. Total assets reflect (i) the principal amount of our senior and mezzanine loans; and (ii) the cost basis of our CMBS B-Pieces, net of variable interest entity ("VIE") liabilities. In accordance with GAAP, we carry our CMBS B-Piece investments at fair value. In April 2018, we sold our controlling beneficial interest in four of our five CMBS trusts for net proceeds of $112.7 million and recognized a gain of $13.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had a $2.6 million unrealized loss on the remaining CMBS investment. 

(A) | Excludes CMBS B-Pieces. Our CMBS B-Piece portfolio diversification is as follows and is inclusive of our $29.6 million investment in RECOP, an unconsolidated VIE of which KREF is not the primary beneficiary:


• | Property Type: Office (28.4%), Retail (24.8%) Hospitality (15.3%), and Other (31.5%). As of December 31, 2018, no other individual property type comprised more than 10% of our total CMBS B‑Piece portfolio. 


• | Geography: California (23.0%), New York (12.5%) Texas (8.5%) and Other (56.0%). As of December 31, 2018, no other individual geography comprised more than 5% of our total CMBS B‑Piece portfolio. 


• | Vintage: 2015 (19.6%), 2016 (10.2%), and 2017 (70.2%). 

(B)    LTV is generally based on the initial loan amount divided by the as-is appraised value as of the date the loan was originated.
Our senior loans had a weighted average loan to value ratio ("LTV") of 68% as of December 31, 2018, and we have focused our portfolio on senior positions in the capital structure where the sponsor has meaningful cash or imputed equity subordinated to our position to provide what we believe is downside protection in the event of credit impairment at the asset level. As of December 31, 2018, we maintained a controlling position in all of our senior loans and subordinate debt positions (subject to the terms of our master repurchase agreements, as applicable).
For additional information regarding our portfolio as of December 31, 2018, see Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
Our Financing Strategy
We raise capital through offerings of our equity and debt securities to fund future investments. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed two underwritten public offerings of 9.5 million shares of our common stock, of which 4.0 million shares were secondary shares sold by certain of our shareholders. The 5.5 million of primary shares issued and sold by us provided us with net proceeds of $107.7 million. We also issued $143.8 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior convertible notes due May 2023 ("Convertible Notes").
In addition, as part of our portfolio financing strategy, we may use both direct and structural leverage. Our use of direct leverage includes the utilization of repurchase facilities, asset specific financing, term loan financing, collateralized loan obligations, and revolving credit agreements. Asset based financing, term loan financing and collateralized loan obligations provide us with non-mark-to-market financing source which reduces our exposure to market fluctuations. In addition, we may use structural leverage by syndicating senior mortgage interests in our originated senior loans to other investors and creating subordinated interest that we retain for our portfolio. When utilizing structural leverage, our retained interest is generally a mezzanine loan, secured by a pledge of 100% of the equity ownership interests in the owner of the real property and is generally not subject to recourse. Our retained interest when utilizing structural leverage is subordinate to the lien of the third-party lender that owns the senior interest.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we, (i) issued a $1.0 billion managed collateralized loan obligation ("CLO"), providing $810.0 million of non-mark-to-market portfolio financing, (ii) entered into a $1.0 billion non-recourse term loan facility providing non-mark-to-market asset based financing, (iii) added a $200.0 million asset based financing facility on a non-mark to market basis with partial recourse, (iv) increased the size of our repurchase agreements by adding $250.0 million of capacity and (v) replaced our $75.0 million revolving credit facility with a new $100.0 million unsecured corporate revolving credit facility. The following table details our outstanding financing arrangements as of December 31, 2018 (amounts in thousands):

 | Portfolio Financing Outstanding Principal Balance | | Maximum Capacity
Master repurchase agreements | $ | 1,157,261 | | | $ | 2,000,000
Asset specific financing | 60,000 | | | 200,000 | 
Term loan financing | 748,414 | | | 1,000,000 | 
Revolving credit agreements | — | | | 100,000 | 
Collateralized loan obligations | 810,000 | | | 810,000 | 
Loan participations sold | 85,880 | | | 85,880 | 
Non-consolidated senior interests | 67,155 | | | 67,155 | 
Total portfolio financing | $ | 2,928,710 | | | $ | 4,263,035

The following chart illustrates our progress in diversifying our financing sources and expanding our non-mark-to-market financing sources to reduce our exposure to market volatility:
Financing Risk Management
The amount of leverage employed on our assets will depend on our Manager's assessment of the credit, liquidity, price volatility and other risks of those assets and the financing counterparties and availability of particular types of financing at any given time.
We plan to maintain leverage levels appropriate to our specific portfolio. On average, we are targeting a leverage ratio on our senior loans of 3.5-to-1 on a debt to equity basis, as compared to our total leverage ratio of 2.6-to-1 as of December 31, 2018. We will endeavor to match the terms and indices of our assets and liabilities and will also seek to minimize the risks associated with mark-to-market and recourse borrowing.
Investment Guidelines
Under the management agreement with our Manager, our Manager is required to manage our business in accordance with certain investment guidelines, which include:

• | seeking to invest our capital in a broad range of investments in or relating to CRE debt;


• | not making investments that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes;


• | not making investments that would cause us or any of our subsidiaries to be required to be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act;


• | allowing allocation of investment opportunities sourced by our Manager to one or more KKR funds advised by our Manager or its affiliates in addition to us, in accordance with the allocation policy then in effect, as applied by our Manager in a fair and equitable manner;


• | prior to the deployment of capital into investments, causing our capital to be invested in any short-term investments in money market funds, bank accounts, overnight repurchase agreements with primary federal reserve bank dealers collateralized by direct U.S. government obligations and other instruments or investments reasonably determined by our Manager to be of high quality; and


• | investing not more than 25% of our "equity" in any individual investment without the approval of a majority of our board of directors or a duly constituted committee of our board of directors (it being understood, however, that for purposes of the foregoing concentration limit, in the case of any investment that is comprised (whether through a structured investment vehicle or other arrangement) of securities, instruments or assets of multiple portfolio issuers, such investment for purposes of the foregoing limitation will be deemed to be multiple investments in such underlying securities, instruments and assets and not such particular vehicle, product or other arrangement in which they are aggregated).

Impact of Rising Interest Rates
Generally, our business model is such that rising interest rates will result in an increase to our earnings and dividend yield. As of December 31, 2018, 98.0% of our investments by total assets earned interest over a floating-rate index and of those investments that were financed, all were financed with liabilities that pay interest over a floating-rate index, which resulted in a positive correlation to rising interest rates for our company.
Additionally, floating-rate senior loans typically have lower interest rate sensitivity and less susceptibility to price declines than fixed-rate investments when short-term rates rise. As a result, we believe that our investment strategy, which is primarily focused on originating or acquiring LIBOR-based senior loans, strategically positions our portfolio to earn attractive risk-adjusted yields in a rising interest rate environment. Furthermore, 80% of our senior loans by current principal amount outstanding have a LIBOR floor in place greater than 0.50%.
With respect to our fixed-rate exposure in our portfolio, an increase in long-term interest rates could have a negative impact on the market value of those investments. Several factors would impact the ultimate market value, including but not limited to, the remaining duration, underlying LTV and credit profile today, credit spreads and other factors.
With respect to our fixed-rate CMBS portfolio, rising interest rates could have a negative effect on the value of the securities in our portfolio. Our CMBS securities are purchased at a substantial discount to their face amount and are much more sensitive to changes in the underlying credit of the securities and credit spreads than to fluctuations in interest rates. However, an increase in long-term rates, with other factors held constant, may have a negative impact on the market value of the CMBS portfolio.
The following chart illustrates the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in LIBOR (dollars in millions):

(1) | As of December 31, 2018. Assumes loans are drawn up to maximum approved advance rate based on current principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2018.

For a further discussion, see Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Interest Rate Risk."
Taxation of the Company
We elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014 and expect to continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT. So long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on net taxable income that we distribute annually to our stockholders. In order to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the real estate qualification of sources of our income, the composition and values of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the diversity of ownership of our stock. In order to comply with REIT requirements, we may need to forego 
otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities and limit the manner in which we conduct our operations.
See Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors—Risks Related to our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax Considerations."
Competition
We are engaged in a competitive business. In our lending and investing activities, we compete for opportunities with a variety of institutional lenders and investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds (including funds that KKR or its affiliates may in the future sponsor, advise and/or manage), commercial and investment banks, commercial finance and insurance companies and other financial institutions. Several other REITs have raised, or are expected to raise, significant amounts of capital, and may have investment objectives that overlap with ours, which may create additional competition for lending and investment opportunities. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. Many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT rule compliance or maintenance of an exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of loans and investments, offer more attractive pricing or other terms and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, competition for originations of and investments in our target assets may lead to the yields of such assets decreasing, which may further limit our ability to generate satisfactory returns.
In addition, changes in the financial regulatory regime could decrease the current restrictions on banks and other financial institutions and allow them to compete with us for investment opportunities that were previously not available to them. See Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Company—Changes in laws or regulations governing our operations, changes in the interpretation thereof or newly enacted laws or regulations and any failure by us to comply with these laws or regulations, could require changes to certain of our business practices, negatively impact our operations, cash flow or financial condition, impose additional costs on us, subject us to increased competition or otherwise adversely affect our business."
We believe access to our Manager's and KKR's professionals and their industry expertise and relationships provide us with competitive advantages in assessing risks and determining appropriate pricing for potential investments. We believe these relationships will enable us to compete more effectively for attractive investment opportunities. However, we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face. For additional information concerning these competitive risks, see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Lending and Investment Activities—We operate in a competitive market for lending and investment opportunities, and competition may limit our ability to originate or acquire desirable loans and investments or dispose of assets we target and could also affect the yields of these assets and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations."
