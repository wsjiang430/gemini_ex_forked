Item 1. Business
Business and Company Formation
 
Solitario Zinc Corp. (“Solitario” or the “Company”) is an exploration stage company as defined in Industry Guide 7, as issued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Solitario was incorporated in the state of Colorado on November 15, 1984 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crown Resources Corporation ("Crown"). In July 1994, Solitario became a publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the "TSX") through its initial public offering. Solitario has been actively involved in mineral exploration since 1993. Solitario’s primary business is to acquire exploration mineral properties and/or discover economic deposits on its mineral properties and advance these deposits, either on its own or through joint ventures, up to the development stage. At that point, or sometime prior to that point, Solitario would likely attempt to sell its mineral properties, pursue their development either on its own, or through a joint venture with a partner that has expertise in mining operations, or create a royalty with a third party that continues to advance the property. Solitario has never developed a property. Although Solitario has owned exploration projects in both precious and base metals in the past, Solitario’s current focus is on the acquisition and exploration of zinc-related exploration mineral properties. However, Solitario may still evaluate and/or acquire other precious metal projects as part of its overall mineral property activity. In addition to focusing on its mineral exploration properties and the evaluation of mineral properties for acquisition, Solitario also evaluates potential strategic transactions for the acquisition of new precious and base metal properties and assets with exploration potential or business combinations that Solitario determines to be favorable to Solitario.
 
In July 2017 Solitario completed the acquisition of Zazu Metals Corp. (“Zazu”) whereby Solitario issued 19,788,177 shares of its common stock for all the issued and outstanding common shares of Zazu (the “Acquisition”). Zazu had one primary asset, its interest in the Lik project, and the Acquisition was treated as an asset purchase.
 
Solitario has recorded revenue from the sale of mineral properties, including the sale on April 26, 2018 of its interest in the royalty on the Yanacocha property (discussed below), the sale in 2015 of its former interest in Mount Hamilton LLC the owner of Solitario’s former Mt. Hamilton project (the “Mt. Hamilton Transaction”), joint venture property payments and the sale of a royalty on the former Mt. Hamilton project. Revenues from the sale or joint venture of properties or assets, although significant when they occur, have not been a consistent annual source of revenue and would only occur in the future, if at all, on an infrequent basis.
 
Solitario currently considers its carried interest in the Florida Canyon project in Peru and its interest in the Lik project in Alaska to be its core mineral property assets. Nexa Resources, Ltd. (“Nexa”), Solitario’s joint venture partner, initiated a 17,000-meter drilling program at Florida Canyon during the fourth quarter of 2018 (discussed below), which is expected to be completed during 2019. Solitario is working with its 50% joint venture partner, Teck American Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Teck Resources Limited (both companies are referred to in this Annual Report as “Teck”) and completed a limited exploration program at the Lik project during 2018 consisting of mapping, geophysical work, relogging of prior drilling core and environmental evaluation.
 
As of December 31, 2018, Solitario has significant balances of cash and short-term investments that Solitario anticipates using, in part, to further the development of the Florida Canyon and Lik projects and to potentially acquire additional mineral property assets. The fluctuations in precious metal and other commodity prices contribute to a challenging environment for mineral exploration and development, which has created opportunities as well as challenges for the potential acquisition of early-stage and advanced mineral exploration projects or other related assets at potentially attractive terms.

Recent Developments
 
On April 26, 2018 Solitario sold its royalty interest in the non-producing Yanacocha property (the “Yanacocha Royalty”) to a wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont Mining Corporation (“Newmont”) for approximately $502,000 in cash. The Yanacocha Royalty covered 43 concessions totaling 36,052 hectares. Newmont owns the underlying mineral concessions covered by the Yanacocha Royalty. None of the concessions covered by the Yanacocha Royalty have any reported reserves or resources. Solitario had no mineral property capitalized cost in the Yanacocha Royalty and recorded Mineral Property Revenue of $502,000 during 2018.

Mineral Exploration Properties
 
We hold a 50% operating interest in the Lik zinc-lead-silver property in Northwest Alaska, which is estimated to contain a large tonnage, high-grade deposit potentially mineable by open-pit methods. Teck is a 50% partner with Solitario in the Lik deposit, with Solitario acting as the project manager. A Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) was completed on the Lik deposit in 2014.
 
Solitario’s other core asset is a 39% interest in the advanced, high-grade, Florida Canyon zinc project located in northern Peru. The project has a significant mineral resource and Solitario is fully carried to production by its joint venture partner Nexa, formerly Votorantim Metais Holdings, SA (“Votorantim”) and Compañía Minera Milpo S.A.A. (“Milpo”). Solitario and Nexa completed a PEA on the Florida Canyon deposit in August 2017. Nexa is one of the largest zinc producers in Peru. Since inception of the Florida Canyon joint venture in 2006, Nexa has funded 100% of project expenditures. Nexa will earn a 70% interest in the project by continuing to solely fund all project expenditures, excluding a portion of the 2018-2019 drilling program, discussed below, and committing to place the project into production based upon a positive feasibility study. After earning 70%, and at the request of Solitario, Nexa has further agreed to finance Solitario's 30% participating interest for construction. Solitario will repay the loan facility through 50% of its net cash flow distributions.
 
In August of 2018, Solitario agreed to fund a portion of a 2018 – 2019 drilling program at the Florida Canyon project. Per the agreement, Solitario will fund up to $1,580,000 of a planned 41-hole 17,000-meter drilling program to be conducted through December 31, 2019 (the “Drilling Program”). Upon Nexa completing the first 1,700 meters of the Drilling Program, Solitario will pay Nexa $527,000, upon completion of the next 1,700 meters (3,400 meters total) of the Drilling Program, Solitario will pay Nexa $527,000, and upon completion of the third 1,700 meters (5,100 meters total) of the Drilling Program, Solitario will pay Nexa the balance remaining on its $1,580,000 funding commitment, or $526,000. Solitario has no obligation to pay Nexa prior to the attainment of the separate 1,700-meter thresholds. The funding commitments are in the form of an advance on Solitario’s commitment to fund 30% of any future construction development costs of Florida Canyon under the original joint venture agreement discussed above. Accordingly, in the event the Florida Canyon project is developed, which cannot be assured at this time, any funds paid to Nexa under this agreement will reduce the amount of Solitario’s obligation to fund 30% of future development costs, and / or repay loans from Nexa for future development costs at the Florida Canyon project. As of December 31, 2018, Nexa had completed four holes and a total of 2,203 meters under the Drilling Program, and Solitario has recorded an account payable to Nexa of $527,000 and recorded a charge to exploration expense of $527,000.
 
At December 31, 2018, Solitario also owns the La Promesa gold exploration project. Solitario also holds an 85% interest in the Chambara exploration project in Peru (Nexa holds the remaining 15%), and a 9.9% equity interest in Vendetta Mining Corp. (“Vendetta”).

Subsequent to December 31, 2018, on January 22, 2019, we announced the sale of our interests in a retained royalty on the Pedra Branca project in Brazil, a retained royalty on non-producing exploration properties in Mexico, and an option to purchase a royalty on certain non-producing mineral claims in Montana to SilverStream SEZC (“SilverStream”), a private Cayman Island royalty and streaming company for Cdn$250,000 in cash and a one-year promissory note from SilverStream for Cdn$350,000.
 
We are conducting exploration and property evaluation activities in Peru either on our own using contract geologists, or through joint ventures operated by our partners.
 
Our exploration activities and those of our joint venture partners are carried out on a property-by-property basis. These activities may include prospecting, geologic mapping, sampling, geophysics and drilling. When we determine that this work indicates a project may not be economic or contain sufficient geologic or economic potential, we may impair or completely write-off the property. A significant factor in the success or failure of our activities is the price of commodities. For example, when the price of zinc or other commodities is down, we may determine that the value of our mineral exploration properties decreases; however, during such down markets it may also become easier and less expensive to locate and acquire new mineral exploration properties.
 
We have recorded revenue in the past from the sale of mineral properties, joint venture property payments and the sale of a royalty on our formerly-held Mt. Hamilton property. Proceeds from the sale or joint venture of properties, although potentially significant when they occur, have not been a consistent source of cash and may only occur in the future, if at all, on an infrequent basis. Accordingly, while we conduct exploration activities on our projects, we need to maintain and replenish our capital resources. Historically, we have met our need for capital through (i) sale of our Yanacocha royalty to Newmont for $502,000 during 2018; (ii) proceeds received from the Mt. Hamilton Transaction; (iii) sales of our shares of common stock of Vendetta and Kinross Gold Corporation (“Kinross”); (iv) borrowing in the form of short-term margin debt secured by our investment in Kinross; (v) borrowing under long-term debt secured by our former Mt. Hamilton project (vi) joint venture delay rental payments, including payments on our Florida Canyon project; (vii) a royalty sale for $10,000,000 in 2012; (viii) issuances of common stock; (ix) sales of covered call options on our Kinross common stock; and (x) interest on short term Treasury Notes and Bank CDs. In the past, we have reduced our exposure to the costs of our exploration activities through the use of joint ventures.
 
We operate in one segment: mineral exploration. We currently conduct exploration activities in Peru and Alaska and evaluate properties for potential acquisition and evaluation of strategic corporate opportunities throughout North and South America. As of February 28, 2019, we had four full-time employees located in the United States and no full-time employees outside of the United States. We utilize contract managers, geologists, administrators and laborers to execute our Latin American and North American project work and acquisition evaluations.
 
A large number of companies are engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties, many of which have substantially greater technical and financial resources than we have and, accordingly, we may be at a disadvantage in being able to compete effectively for the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. We are not aware of any single competitor or group of competitors that dominate the exploration and development of mineral properties. In acquiring mineral properties for exploration and development, we rely on the experience, technical expertise and knowledge of our employees and advisors, which is limited by the size of our company compared to many of our competitors who may have either more employees or employees with more specialized knowledge and experience.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
Mineral development and exploration activities are subject to various national, state/provincial, and local laws and regulations, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters.  Similarly, if any of our properties are developed and/or mined those activities are also subject to significant governmental regulation and oversight. We are required to obtain the licenses, permits and other authorizations in order to conduct our exploration programs.
Environmental Regulations
 
Our current and planned activities are subject to various national and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. We are required to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Changes to current local, state or federal laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we conduct our exploration activities could, in the future, require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects. During 2018, we had no material environmental incidents or non-compliance with any applicable environmental regulations.
