ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of novel product candidates against validated molecular targets in indications of high unmet medical need. We focus on molecules and pathways whose role in the disease process is well known based on prior research, but have previously failed to yield successful products due to poor efficacy and tolerability. Our unique approach to drug development leverages recent technological advances to design improved drugs, employs early use of biomarkers to confirm biological activity and focuses on abbreviated regulatory pathways. Our first molecular target is aldose reductase, or AR, an enzyme that converts glucose to sorbitol under oxidative stress conditions, and is implicated in multiple diseases. Prior attempts to inhibit this enzyme were hindered by nonselective, nonspecific inhibition, which resulted in limited efficacy and significant off-target safety effects. The detrimental consequences of AR activation have been well established by decades of prior research. Our AR program currently includes three small molecules, which are all potent and selective inhibitors of AR, but are engineered to have unique tissue permeability profiles to target different disease states, including diabetic complications, heart disease and rare metabolic diseases. The result of this unique multifaceted approach to drug development is a portfolio of highly specific and selective product candidates that we believe are significantly de-risked and can move quickly through the development process.

AT-007 is a novel central nervous system, or CNS, penetrant ARI that we are developing for the treatment of rare metabolic diseases, including Galactosemia and Sorbitol Dehydrogenase (SORD) Deficiency. Galactosemia is a devastating rare pediatric metabolic disease that affects how the body processes a simple sugar called galactose, and for which there is no known cure or approved treatment available. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted both orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation to AT-007 for the treatment of Galactosemia and in June 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to AT-007 for the treatment of Galactosemia. We have completed an adult study in healthy volunteers and Galactosemia patients, demonstrating that AT-007 is safe and well tolerated, and significantly reduces plasma galactitol levels vs. placebo. Galactitol is a toxic metabolite of galactose, which is formed in Galactosemia patients by aberrant activity of AR when galactose is present at high levels. A pediatric study is underway in children with Galactosemia, assessing the impact of AT-007 vs. placebo on safety, biomarker reduction of galactitol, and long-term functional outcomes. On April 13, 2021, we presented data featuring a cross-sectional analysis of nineteen pediatric patients with Classic Galactosemia, providing meaningful insight on the progressive worsening of the central nervous system phenotype with age. On October 18, 2021, we reported biomarker data from the pediatric ACTION-Galactosemia Kids study. The results demonstrate a substantial reduction in plasma galactitol of approximately 40%, which was statistically significant (p<0.001) vs. placebo. We previously reported a baseline analysis of the 47 children enrolled in the study which demonstrated a clear correlation between baseline galactitol levels and baseline clinical functional outcomes. The long-term functional outcomes portion of the pediatric study is ongoing, and the outcomes are assessed every 6 months by a fire-walled data monitoring committee (DMC). When the study reaches statistical significance in the active treated arm vs. the placebo arm, the DMC will alert the Company and the trial will be unblinded. Statistical modelling suggests that this should occur at approximately the 18-month outcome assessment, based on currently available predictive information. In April 2022, the Company met with the FDA to discuss the design of the ongoing pediatric study prior to the first 6-month outcomes assessment by the DMC. The FDA confirmed that the pediatric study as it is currently designed would support an NDA submission if statistical significance is reached, and there is alignment between the FDA and the Company on the potential path forward to approval. The 12-month clinical outcomes were assessed by the fire-walled DMC, and as expected the data did not yet reach statistical significance, but demonstrated a trend in clinical outcomes favoring AT-007 vs. placebo. A safety analysis showed that AT-007 continued to be safe and well tolerated. The Company is exploring a potential submission for conditional approval based on existing data with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). 
​
AT-007 is also being studied in a rare disease caused by deficiency in the enzyme Sorbitol Dehydrogenase, called SORD Deficiency. AR is the first enzyme in the polyol pathway, converting glucose to sorbitol. AR is then followed by Sorbitol Dehydrogenase, which converts sorbitol to fructose. Patients with SORD Deficiency accumulate very high levels of sorbitol in their cells and tissues as a result of the enzyme deficiency, which results in tissue toxicities such as peripheral neuropathy and motor neuron disease. Recent research in drosophila and cell models of SORD Deficiency demonstrated that treatment with an ARI that blocks sorbitol production may provide benefit in this disease. Preclinical studies on AT-007 have demonstrated significant reduction in sorbitol levels in fibroblasts from SORD deficient patients. Treatment with AT-007 in the drosophila model of SORD prevented the disease phenotype and protected from neuronal degeneration. On October 25, 2021, we reported data from a pilot open-label study in 8 SORD Deficiency patients. AT-007 reduced blood sorbitol levels by approximately 66% from baseline through 30 days of treatment. AT-007 was safe and well tolerated in all treated patients. In December 2021, we initiated a Phase 2/3 registrational study in patients with SORD Deficiency, which is ongoing at multiple clinical sites in the US and Europe. On February 16, 2023, we announced that in a pre-specified interim analysis of the ongoing Phase 3 INSPIRE trial, AT-007 reduced sorbitol levels by a mean of approximately 52% (or approximately 16,000ng/ml) over 90 days of treatment (p<0.001 vs. placebo) in patients with SORD Deficiency. At baseline, the mean blood sorbitol level of SORD patients included in this interim analysis was approximately 29,000ng/ml, with a range of approximately 22,000ng/ml-38,000ng/ml. In the INSPIRE trial, a baseline cross-sectional analysis of the relationship between sorbitol level, age (or duration of disease) and clinical outcome measures demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between sorbitol level and key clinical outcome measures, including 10-meter-walk/run speed, 4-stair climb speed, and sit-to-stand test (p<0.05). The Company is working with the FDA to determine the appropriate regulatory path forward, as well as data required for an NDA submission, to advance AT-007 towards registration for this indication. The INSPIRE study will continue in blinded format to the 12-month interim clinical outcomes assessment. If the primary clinical outcome measure (10-meter-walk/run) reaches statistical significance at 12 months, the study will be completed and unblinded. If not, the study will continue in blinded format to 24 months, where clinical outcomes will be assessed again in a final statistical analysis. AT-007 continues to be safe and well tolerated to date.

​
We also plan to initiate a clinical development program on AT-007 in another pediatric rare disease, called PMM2-CDG. PMM2-CDG is a glycosylation disorder caused by deficiencies in the enzyme phosphomannomutase 2, which leads to CNS symptoms similar to Galactosemia, including low IQ, tremor, and speech and motor problems. AR is over-activated in this disease as a compensatory consequence of PMM2 deficiency, and a CNS penetrant ARI may be a compelling clinical option. Initial data in fibroblast cell lines derived from PMM2-CDG patients demonstrates that AT-007 treatment increases phosphomannomutase 2 activity. A young child with PMM2-CDG is being treated in a single-patient investigator initiated trial with AT-007 at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Data has been presented at medical conferences in 2022 supporting a favorable treatment effect of AT-007 on biomarkers and organ function in this patient. The FDA has granted pediatric rare disease designation and orphan designation for AT-007 in PMM2-CDG. 
​
In January 2023 we announced a partnership with Advanz Pharma for commercialization of AT-007 (govorestat) in Europe, and entered into an Exclusive License and Supply Agreement with Advanz Pharma (the Advanz Agreement). Advanz Pharma is a pharmaceutical company with a strategic focus on commercialization of specialty, hospital, and rare disease medicines in Europe. Under the terms of the Advanz Agreement, Advanz Pharma receives exclusive commercial rights in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the UK for AT-007 in Galactosemia and SORD Deficiency, with certain rights to future indications for AT-007 in Europe. We will receive certain near-term development milestone payments upon clinical trial completion and marketing authorization in Europe as well as commercial sales milestones, which in the aggregate amount to over €130 million, including €10 million upfront, which was paid upon signing. We will also receive royalties on any future net sales of AT-007 in Europe of 20%. We will continue to be responsible for the development, manufacturing and supply of AT-007, and Advanz Pharma will be responsible for packaging, distribution and commercialization in Europe.
​
AT-001 is a novel ARI with broad systemic exposure and peripheral nerve permeability that we are developing for the treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy, or DbCM, a fatal fibrosis of the heart, for which no treatments are available. We completed a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating AT-001 in approximately 120 patients with type 2 diabetes, in which no drug-related adverse effects or tolerability issues were observed. In September 2019, we announced the initiation of a Phase 3 registrational trial of AT-001 in DbCM. The study, called ARISE-HF, is designed to evaluate AT-001’s ability to improve or prevent the decline of functional capacity in patients with DbCM at high risk of progression to overt heart failure. Although we did experience enrollment delays in 2020 associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, modifications were made to the trial to include additional sites and geographies to address Covid-19-related issues. The trial is now fully enrolled with 675 patients.
​
AT-003 is a novel ARI designed to cross through the back of the eye when dosed orally, and has demonstrated strong retinal penetrance, for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, or DR. DR is an ophthalmic disease that occurs in diabetic patients and for which treatments are currently limited to high-cost biologics requiring intravitreal administration. DR has been linked to AR activity, including elevations in sorbitol and subsequent changes in retinal blood vessels, which distorts vision and leads to permanent blindness. 
AT-104 is a preclinical dual selective PI3K inhibitor. Due to recent regulatory changes impacting development of the PI3K inhibitor class of compounds, the Company has discontinued its early stage preclinical PI3K program and further development of AT-104. The compound and all rights associated with the technology were returned to Columbia University.
Since inception in 2016, our operations have focused on developing our product candidates, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and conducting clinical trials. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue.
We have incurred significant operating losses since inception in 2016. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net loss was $82.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $348.8 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future in connection with our ongoing activities. Furthermore, we expect 

4



to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $30.5 million.
Our management team and scientific advisory board are composed of accomplished scientists and clinicians with decades of experience developing drugs for a wide range of diseases. Our view is that drug development does not always need to follow the standard approach, which often requires long and costly development programs before drugs become available to patients. By taking a unique and focused approach to drug development, we believe we can significantly shorten development programs and bring lifesaving drugs to patients in urgent need. In May 2019, we completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) whereby we sold 4,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $10.00 per share, resulting in aggregate net proceeds of $34.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In November 2019, we completed a private placement of 1,380,344 shares of our common stock (the “Private Placement”), which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $18.4 million. In January 2020, we completed a secondary public offering of 2,471,489 shares of our common stock, including 411,223 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares (the “Secondary Public Offering”), pursuant to which we received $134.1 million of proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In February 2021, we issued and sold 3,000,000 shares of common stock (the 
“February Offering”) at a public offering price of $23.00 per share, with an additional 450,000 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares in the February Offering. We received aggregate net proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs of $74.4 million. In June 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of 20,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 10,000,000 Pre-Funded Warrants, and accompanying Common Warrants to purchase up to 30,000,000 shares of our common stock. The shares and accompanying Common Warrants were offered at a price to the public of $1.00 per share and warrant, and the Pre-Funded Warrants and accompanying Common Warrants were offered at a price to the public of $0.9999, resulting in aggregate net proceeds of approximately $27.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
​
We are actively pursuing several potential financing options. While we continue to explore opportunities to raise additional equity capital in the public markets, this has proven to be challenging in the biotech sector recently. Other options for structured finance which we continue to explore include a PIPE, debt, convertible debt, and synthetic royalty financing. Synthetic royalty financing, in particular, has become a favorable option for many companies for funding ongoing clinical development in late-stage and pre-approval programs. We have engaged an investment bank and we are specifically exploring this option in the near term. Additionally, we are in active dialogue with several potential partners regarding business development opportunities related to one or more of our programs. There can be no assurances that our discussions with any of the current counterparties will be successful, and the Company expects to continue to pursue additional opportunities. 
​
Our Strategy
Our goal is to bring potentially transformative therapies to market across a range of fatal or debilitating diseases for which no treatments are available. The critical components of our strategy include:

● | Leveraging our unique approach to develop our pipeline of novel ARIs. We target molecules and pathways that have a proven role in disease, but have previously failed to yield successful products due to poor efficacy and tolerability. Our unique approach to drug development utilizes recent technological advances to design improved drugs, employs early use of biomarkers to confirm biological activity and focuses on abbreviated regulatory pathways. We develop product candidates with increased potency and selectivity by leveraging recent technological advances in high throughput crystallography and in silico structural design. Our strategy is also informed by early use of biomarkers to confirm biological activity and target engagement. Early proof of biological activity through biomarkers in clinical trials combined with data from prior clinical development programs on first generation drugs significantly de-risks clinical development in our target indications. AR is our first molecular target that has been implicated in multiple diseases and for which sorbitol levels can be assessed as a biomarker of enzyme activity. Prior AR-targeting compounds produced nonselective inhibitors and failed to demonstrate adequate safety and

● | Rapidly advancing the development of our ARI product candidates, AT-007, AT-001 and AT-003. Registrational studies for AT-007 in pediatric Galactosemia and SORD Deficiency and for AT-001 for the treatment of DbCM are ongoing.

● | Taking advantage of regulatory pathways designed for accelerated drug development in indications with high unmet need and seeking strategic partnerships in other indications. We plan to leverage abbreviated development programs and biomarker-based approaches for rapid drug development and regulatory approval where possible. For indications that require standard development programs, we plan to seek strategic partnerships.

● | Expanding our pipeline to products targeting other validated molecules and pathways outside of AR. We will continue leveraging our relationships with academic institutions and universities to acquire or license additional technologies that are consistent with our strategy of applying new technologies to validated molecular pathways.

The following table shows the status of our current ARI and PI3K inhibitor programs:

We seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates, our core technology, and other know-how through U.S. and foreign patent protection. To the extent that our platform is not patentable, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests.

Our Product Candidates
Our Aldose Reductase Program
AR is the first enzyme and rate-limiting step in the polyol pathway, an alternative glucose metabolism pathway. AR is a redox-regulated enzyme that is activated by an altered redox state within the cell, which occurs during hyperglycemia and ischemia. AR activation is associated with downstream consequences of hyperglycemia, such as diabetic complications, as well as consequences of ischemia in the heart, such as acute myocardial infarction and chronic 

6



heart failure. As shown in the figure below, AR activity produces excess sorbitol, which causes osmotic dysregulation within cells and tissues, such as nerve and retina, and is toxic to many cell types, including cardiomyocytes. Sorbitol is also further metabolized to fructose, which initiates a cascade of metabolic dysregulation and inflammatory damage to cells, such as: reactive oxygen species, or ROS, generation; advanced glycation end products, or AGE; protein kinase C, or PKC, activation; and methylglyoxal overproduction. Under non-oxidative, or healthy patient conditions, AR remains largely inactive and less than 3% of a healthy person’s glucose is processed by the polyol pathway. However, when the oxidative environment of the cell changes due to hyperglycemia or ischemia, AR is both activated and upregulated, and greater than 30% of the patient’s glucose is then shunted through the polyol pathway, resulting in significant downstream damage to cells and tissues. The detrimental consequences of AR activation have been well established by decades of prior research. These include broad effects, such as mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death, as well as tissue-specific changes, such as neuronal degeneration in peripheral nerves, collagen crosslinking and fibrosis in cardiac tissue, and damage to blood vessels in the lens of the eye.

Additionally, as shown in the figure below, abnormal AR activity is associated with conversion of galactose to galactitol in patients with Galactosemia. Galactitol, like sorbitol, does not cross the cell membrane and causes damage to cells across a wide range of tissues, including neurons in the brain, retinal cells in the eye and peripheral nerve tissue.
Galactitol Accumulation Results in Tissue Specific Damage
*     GALK, or galactokinase, and GALT, or galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase, are enzymes that metabolize galactose.
**   Galactose-1-phosphate is referred to as Gal-1P.
During the 1980s and 1990s, AR was a significant target of drug development due to its established role in a wide range of debilitating indications. Although these programs failed to produce effective drugs with a favorable risk/benefit profile, the prior ARI clinical development programs validated the role of AR in the pathogenesis of several diabetic complications and provided useful information on optimal patient criteria and trial design.
By applying new techniques in crystallography to better understand how the enzyme works, and applying in silico design and medicinal chemistry approaches, we have developed compounds with logarithmically improved potency and increased selectivity. Our technology includes specific compounds that are in various stages of preclinical and clinical development, and is coupled with an understanding of how the enzyme works and a knowledge base of structural approaches to drug the target while controlling drug characteristics, such as PK, solubility and tissue permeability.

AT-007 for the Treatment of Rare Metabolic Disease (Galactosemia, SORD Deficiency, PMM2-CDG)
Overview
AT-007 is a novel CNS penetrant ARI for the treatment of CNS rare diseases, including Galactosemia, SORD deficiency and PMM2-CDG. 
​
Galactosemia
Galactosemia is a devastating rare pediatric metabolic disease that affects how the body processes a simple sugar called galactose, and for which there is no known cure or approved treatment available. High levels of galactose circulating in the blood and tissues of Galactosemia patients enable AR to convert galactose to a toxic metabolite, galactitol, which results in long-term complications ranging from CNS dysfunction to cataracts. AT-007 was specifically designed to be CNS penetrant to address AR activity in the brain and potentially prevent CNS consequences of the disease. We have demonstrated that treatment with AT-007 in an animal model of Galactosemia reduces toxic galactitol levels and prevents disease complications. We have also demonstrated that in patients with Galactosemia, plasma galactitol level statistically correlates with disease severity (p=0.004), further supporting the role of toxic galactitol in causing long-term disease complications. In adult and pediatric Galactosemia patients, we have demonstrated that AT 007 treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in plasma galactitol versus placebo. A pediatric long-term clinical study is underway.

9



Diagnosis and Standard of Care
Galactosemia is caused by severe deficiency in the GALK or GALT enzymes that metabolize galactose. Galactose is a sugar produced endogenously by the body, and is also a metabolite of lactose. Galactosemia is often fatal in infants within the first weeks of life if they are exposed to dietary lactose in the form of breast milk or dairy-based formula. As such, there is mandatory newborn screening for Galactosemia in the United States and many countries in Europe. While prompt identification of infants with Galactosemia and immediate implementation of a lactose-restricted diet prevents many fatalities, long-term consequences of disease persist due to endogenous generation of galactose within the body. We are specifically developing AT-007 for patients with severe enzyme deficiencies in GALK, which is referred to as type 2 Galactosemia, and GALT, which is referred to as classic Galactosemia. In these patients, despite dietary restriction, Galactosemia manifests as a combination of CNS and systemic toxicities in tissues, including cognitive dysfunction and intellectual deficiencies, speech and motor pathologies, pre-senile cataracts and tremor, as well as ovarian insufficiency in females.
There are no treatments available for Galactosemia. Due to endogenous production of galactose within the body, infants with Galactosemia develop significant complications even with immediate implementation of, and strict adherence to, a dairy-free diet. CNS complications include cognitive impairment, low IQ, speech and motor deficiencies, and seizures. In addition, nearly all females develop ovarian insufficiency. Further to the damage that occurs in childhood, many adults also develop persistent cataracts, seizures, and experience progressive worsening of tremor, cognitive, behavioral and psychiatric issues due to ongoing tissue deposition of galactitol.
AR Activity Causes Toxic Accumulation of Galactitol in Galactosemia
We have demonstrated that inhibiting AR activity shifts galactose metabolism to an alternative enzyme called galactose dehydrogenase, which allows galactose to be metabolized to galactonate, a benign substance that is removed in the urine.
Market Opportunity
The global incidence of Galactosemia is estimated to be 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 90,000, depending on ethnicity. The U.S. Galactosemia population is approximately 3,000 patients, based on newborn screening data identifying 

10



2,500 infants through 2014, and the estimated birth rate of 80 patients per year. Prior studies estimated that the U.S. Galactosemia population was higher based on the incidence rates, because they did not take into account that, prior to newborn screening, most infants with Galactosemia died within a few weeks of birth. As a result, the disease prevalence is significantly lower, and the live population with Galactosemia is largely age 40 and younger. The EU population (including the UK) is slightly larger than the US population, estimated at approximately 4,000 patients, leading to a combined US + EU market opportunity of approximately 7,000 patients. When additional markets, such as Japan and Canada are considered, we believe the overall Market opportunity for Galactosemia is approximately 7,600 patients worldwide.
Preclinical Studies
A rat model of classic Galactosemia displays similar biochemical and functional abnormalities to those associated with Galactosemia in humans.
Treatment with AT-007 significantly reduced galactitol levels in target tissues, including blood, brain and liver, without increasing galactose or Gal-1P levels, and prevented complications associated with galactitol accumulation in tissues, including cataract formation and CNS dysfunction. The effects of AT-007 were dose dependent and corresponded with galactitol reduction. 
Clinical Development
ACTION-Galactosemia Phase 1/2 Study
We have evaluated AT-007 in a pivotal Phase 1/2 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and adults with Galactosemia. The Phase 1 portion of the study in healthy volunteers evaluated safety, tolerability, CNS penetrance and PK of AT-007 at doses of 5mg/kg to 40mg/kg for up to seven days of consecutive treatment. The Phase 2 portion in adults with Galactosemia evaluated safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamic reduction in the biomarker galactitol. Patients received AT-007 5mg/kg, 20mg/kg, 40mg/kg or placebo, for 28 days. 
AT-007 treatment resulted in a statistically significant and robust reduction in plasma galactitol versus placebo in adult Galactosemia patients. Reductions in galactitol were dose dependent, with higher concentrations of AT-007 resulting in a greater magnitude of reduction in galactitol. At the higher doses tested (20mg/kg and 40mg/kg), AT-007 significantly reduced plasma galactitol by approximately 50% from baseline. Results were statistically significant (p value of less than 0.01) vs. placebo. Galactitol reduction was rapid and sustained over time. No substantial change from baseline was observed in placebo treated patients. AT-007 was well tolerated in both Galactosemia patients and healthy volunteers.
​
ACTION-Galactosemia Kids
​
In June 2020, we initiated the ACTION-Galactosemia Kids pediatric Galactosemia study. The study was placed on partial clinical hold in August 2020 while we worked with the FDA to redesign and operationally modify the study to seamless design to ensure continuous treatment and the opportunity to receive clinical benefit. The study re-started in February 2021 and is currently ongoing. The pediatric clinical trial is a 2-part study to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and reduction in the toxic biomarker, galactitol (Part A), as well as impact on functional outcomes in children with Galactosemia over time (Part B). Three age cohorts are being studied in parallel: age 2-6, age 7-12, and age 13-17. An additional cohort of children under 2 years of age may be added following analysis of safety data from the initial pediatric cohorts. We have completed the biomarker portion of the study, demonstrating a 40% reduction in plasma galactitol (p<0.001 vs. placebo). The clinical outcomes portion of the study is ongoing, evaluating the impact of AT-007 on how patients feel and function over time.
​
While we had initially planned to submit an NDA for Accelerated Approval based on galactitol reduction, the FDA has since communicated that clinical outcomes data will be required for approval. The long-term functional outcomes portion of the pediatric study is ongoing, and the outcomes are assessed every 6 months by a fire-walled data monitoring committee (DMC). When the study reaches statistical significance in the active treated arm vs. the placebo 

11



arm, the DMC will alert the Company and the trial will be unblinded. Based on discussions with the FDA, the Company believes that the pediatric study as it is currently designed would support an NDA submission if statistical significance is reached. The 12-month clinical outcomes were assessed by the fire-walled DMC, and as expected the data did not yet reach statistical significance, but demonstrated a trend in clinical outcomes favoring AT-007 vs. placebo. A safety analysis showed that AT-007 continued to be safe and well tolerated. The Company is exploring a potential submission for conditional approval based on existing data with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). 
​
SORD Deficiency
SORD Deficiency is a newly characterized genetic cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 2 Disease (“CMT2”) and distal hereditary neuropathy, in which patients are deficient in the enzyme Sorbitol Dehydrogenase (“SORD”). SORD is the enzyme which follows AR in the polyol pathway and converts sorbitol to fructose. Patients who are deficient in SORD can’t metabolize sorbitol normally, and sorbitol levels accumulate to unnaturally high levels. Sorbitol, like galactitol, has been shown to be toxic to cells, especially neurons, resulting in progressive neuronal degeneration. Patients with SORD Deficiency develop progressive neuropathy, which greatly impacts mobility and motility, and significantly affects quality of life. 
Diagnosis and Standard of Care
Currently, patients with SORD Deficiency are diagnosed based on neurological symptoms and confirmatory genetic testing, which is available through several commercial labs and hospital systems. There are currently no drugs approved to treat SORD Deficiency.
Market Opportunity
Genetic studies indicate that approximately 7-9% of CMT2 cases are caused by SORD Deficiency, estimating the US population around 3,300 patients. The EU population (including the UK) is estimated to be approximately 4,400 patients. When additional markets, such as Japan and Canada are considered, we believe the overall Market opportunity for Galactosemia is approximately 8,400 patients worldwide. 
Preclinical Studies
Substrate reduction through AR inhibition in patient fibroblasts and a drosophila model of disease have demonstrated preclinical proof of concept in SORD Deficiency, significantly reducing sorbitol levels and normalizing the drosophila disease phenotype. Preclinical studies in fibroblasts derived from SORD Deficiency patients have demonstrated significant reduction in sorbitol levels with AT-007 treatment. Preclinical studies in the drosophila model of disease have demonstrated a positive impact on the disease phenotype with AT-007 treatment, including mobility (climbing) and prevention of neuronal degeneration. 
Clinical Development
In 2021 we conducted an open-label pilot study in 8 patients with SORD Deficiency. AT-007 treatment significantly reduced sorbitol levels by approximately 66% from baseline, and was safe and well tolerated. In December 2021 we initiated a Phase 2/3 registrational study in patients with SORD Deficiency. The registrational study, called the INSPIRE trial, is designed to demonstrate biomarker efficacy at 3 months through reduction in sorbitol, and long-term clinical efficacy over 2 years of treatment, with an interim clinical outcomes assessment at 12 months. The study is a multicenter placebo controlled trial conducted in the US and Europe in approximately 50 SORD patients age 16 and older. On February 16, 2023, we announced that in a pre-specified interim analysis of the ongoing Phase 3 INSPIRE trial, AT-007 reduced sorbitol levels by a mean of approximately 52% (or approximately 16,000ng/ml) over 90 days of treatment (p<0.001 vs. placebo) in patients with SORD Deficiency. At baseline, the mean blood sorbitol level of SORD patients included in this interim analysis was approximately 29,000ng/ml, with a range of approximately 22,000ng/ml-38,000ng/ml. In the INSPIRE trial, a baseline cross-sectional analysis of the relationship between sorbitol level, age (or duration of disease) and clinical outcome measures demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between sorbitol level and key clinical outcome measures, including 10-meter-walk/run speed, 4-stair climb speed, and sit-to-stand test 

12



(p<0.05). The Company is working with the FDA to determine the appropriate regulatory path forward, as well as data required for an NDA submission, to advance AT-007 towards registration for this indication. The INSPIRE study will continue in blinded format to the 12-month interim clinical outcomes assessment. If the primary clinical outcome measure (10-meter-walk/run) reaches statistical significance at 12 months, the study will be completed and unblinded. If not, the study will continue in blinded format to 24 months, where clinical outcomes will be assessed again in a final statistical analysis. AT-007 continues to be safe and well tolerated to date. 
PMM2-CDG
PMM2-CDG is a glycosylation disorder in which patients have only partial function of the phosphomannomutase enzyme (“PMM2”). As a result, patients do not process sugars properly to support protein glycosylation, which results in systemic problems and multi-organ failure. PMM2-CDG is a severe disease, resulting in and high mortality in children, with no FDA approved treatments. PMM2-CDG is an ultra-rare disease, with only approximately 1,000 patients identified worldwide.
Recently, AR inhibition was demonstrated to positively impact protein glycosylation in PMM2-CDG patient fibroblasts and a C. elegans model of disease. It is believed that AR inhibition results in increased protein glycosylation by shifting the balance of sugar production to support PMM2 activity. In preclinical studies in PMM2-CDG patient fibroblasts, AT-007 significantly improved PMM2 activity. Based on this data, we have received both Orphan Designation and Pediatric Rare Disease designation from the FDA.

AT-001 for the Treatment of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy
Overview
We are developing AT-001, a novel ARI with broad systemic exposure and peripheral nerve permeability being developed for the treatment of DbCM, a fatal fibrosis of the heart, for which no treatments are available. We completed a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating AT-001 in approximately 120 patients with type 2 diabetes, in which no drug-related adverse effects or tolerability issues were observed. This trial also demonstrated target engagement and proof of biological activity, as measured by reduction in sorbitol, a biomarker of AR activity and NTproBNP. A registrational Phase 2/3 study in DbCM patients at high risk of progression to overt heart failure (ARISE-HF) is currently ongoing.
​
Diagnosis and Standard of Care
DbCM is a fatal fibrosis of the heart that occurs in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, which leads to decreased contractility and decreased heart function, eventually resulting in fulminant heart failure. DbCM is caused by metabolic derangements in cardiomyocytes that result in cell death and fibrosis. AR activity has been shown to be a large contributor to these metabolic derangements, and the downstream effect of AR activation is responsible for the cardiomyocyte cell death and fibrosis. DbCM is diagnosed by increased weight of the heart and decreased contractility, which are identified by echocardiographic screening, as well as by exclusion of other forms of heart disease. Epidemiological studies have shown that approximately 17% to 24% of diabetic patients display DbCM in the absence of any other forms of heart disease. These patients do not have hypertension, atherosclerosis, valvular heart disease or ischemia, and the only cause of the cardiomyopathy is the underlying diabetes. Stages of DbCM range from asymptomatic, or stage 1, to acute heart failure, or stage 4. Most patients are not diagnosed until stage 2, where symptoms manifest as extreme shortness of breath during exercise, referred to as decreased exercise tolerance. Exercise tolerance in these patients (as measured by maximum amount of oxygen a person can utilize during intense exercise known as peak VO2) is approximately 25% lower than diabetic patients without DbCM, and decreases by an additional 30% as the patients progress to overt heart failure in later stages of diseases. Patients quickly progress at a steady state of decline to stage 3, which includes marked cavity dilation and severe limitations in daily activities. The final stage of DbCM, stage 4, is represented by acute heart failure resulting in death. The current standard of care is to target glucose control in these patients, as well as hemodynamic modulation of blood flow, through use of beta blockers and diuretics. Both approaches are largely ineffective, and DbCM often results in death within five to ten years of diagnosis. Approximately 24% of DbCM patients progress to overt heart failure or death within 1.5 years of diagnosis, and 37% within five years of diagnosis.

Market Opportunity
According to a retrospective epidemiological study, approximately 17% of patients suffering from diabetes develop DbCM. A study completed in France that utilized echocardiographic screening estimates the proportion of diabetic patients to develop DbCM at approximately 24%. The International Diabetes Foundation estimated that there were approximately 451 million patients globally with diabetes in 2017, which is expected to increase to 693 million by 2045. This includes 58.0 million diabetes patients in Europe in 2017, which is expected to increase to 67.0 million in 2045, and 46.0 million in North America, which is expected to increase to 62.0 million in 2045. Based on an estimated prevalence of 17% of diabetic patients who develop DbCM, we estimate that currently there are approximately 77.0 million patients with DbCM globally, with approximately 8.0 million in North America and 10.0 million in Europe. Initially, our development program will target patients at high risk of progression to overt heart failure, which we estimate constitute approximately 50% of all DbCM patients. We believe these patients represent a symptomatic population that is more likely to be responsive to treatment.
Prior AR-Based Approaches to Treat DbCM
AR activity has been implicated as a strong contributing factor to pathogenesis in DbCM. Pfizer Inc. was developing an ARI, Alond (zopolrestat), for the treatment of DPN and DbCM in a Phase 2 clinical trial that demonstrated favorable outcomes on heart function in DbCM patients, but the clinical trial was discontinued due to an unfavorable risk/benefit profile, with several patients experiencing liver toxicity and significant elevations in both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, which are enzymes central to identification of liver toxicity and damage. In this trial, patients with early-stage DbCM were identified by echocardiographic screening and were randomized to three treatment groups, which consisted of placebo, 500 mg zopolrestat per day or 1,000 mg zopolrestat per day dosed for one year. Due to liver toxicity seen in another trial with zopolrestat, the 1,000 mg treatment arm was reduced to 500 mg, and the two doses were collapsed into one treatment arm. While patients on placebo displayed decreased heart function over the year of the trial as their disease progressed, patients on zopolrestat displayed a stabilization of heart function and even improvement in heart function in some patients based on hemodynamic endpoints. We believe this data validates the approach of using an ARI to improve outcomes for patients with DbCM and using our compounds, which demonstrate improved potency and have been well tolerated, may lead to greater clinical utility.
We have demonstrated that when compared to zopolrestat, AT-001 has significantly higher in vitro enzymatic inhibitory activity and greater specificity for AR. Liver toxicity associated with “old” ARIs such as zopolrestat has been shown to be due to off-target inhibition of a structurally related enzyme, Aldehyde Reductase, which is required for normal liver function. AT-001 demonstrates increased selectivity for AR, and does not inhibit Aldehyde Reductase at any concentration tested. This increased selectivity led to lack of toxicity in cultured hepatocytes, or liver cells, whereas zopolrestat demonstrated significant toxicity in hepatocytes. Thus, we believe that not only is AT-001 a more potent AR inhibitor than prior drugs, but that we have overcome the safety and toxicity limitations from prior compounds, which were due to lack of selectivity and off-target inhibition of Aldehyde Reductase.
Preclinical Efficacy Studies
In a preclinical model of DbCM AT-001 prevented cardiac damage and dysfunction and normalized cardiac energetics. In a diabetic rat model, AT-001 prevented cardiac damage induced by ischemia/repurfusion.
Clinical Development
Until recently, development in cardiovascular disease indications often required large outcome-based trials that examined survival and re-hospitalization as primary endpoints. These trials were extremely large, expensive and time-consuming, and were often confounded by comorbidities in the patient population. As a result, very few cardiovascular programs resulted in approved drugs. There has been a recent effort from the Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products at the FDA, as well as at the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, to streamline drug development for cardiovascular disease to increase the probability of demonstrating a meaningful clinical effect in patients. Specifically, in cardiomyopathies, where there is a direct functional link between hemodynamic endpoints, heart 

14



contractility and quality of life, there is a unique opportunity to demonstrate benefit of therapy in a smaller number of patients and shorter treatment period than was previously required. Recent clinical development programs in hereditary cardiomyopathies have pioneered smaller trials examining exercise tolerance and/or heart functional capacity as a primary endpoint. 
Consistent with these developments, at our pre-IND meeting, the FDA indicated that we would not be required to examine survival and re-hospitalization endpoints, and confirmed that exercise tolerance would qualify as an appropriate primary endpoint in our DbCM trial. This was also recently publicly confirmed by the FDA in a whitepaper entitled “Draft Guidance for Industry: Treatment for Heart Failure: Endpoints for Drug Development.” Accordingly, we designed our pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trial to target functional capacity, or exercise tolerance, as measured by Peak VO2 on Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) in DbCM patients at high risk of progression to overt heart failure.
Phase 1/2 Trial in Adult Type 2 Diabetic Patients
We have evaluated AT-001 in a placebo-controlled Phase 1/2 clinical trial in approximately 120 type 2 diabetes patients. The primary objectives of this trial were to explore the safety, tolerability and PK profile of AT-001. Because AR converts glucose to sorbitol, and AR activity is elevated in diabetic patients, sorbitol normalization was also examined as a pharmacodynamic, or PD, biomarker of target engagement, which provided proof of biological activity in patients.
The Phase 1/2 clinical trial allowed use of concomitant treatments for glucose control, as well as other standard of care treatments for diabetes, such as statins and ACE inhibitors. The FDA permitted us to directly evaluate diabetic patients due to positive data from the preclinical studies, as well as the urgency to develop drugs quickly due to high unmet need. AT-001 was dosed as an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, powder in a rapid release capsule and the trial examined both once-daily and twice-daily, or BID, dosing regimens. 
AT-001 was safe and well tolerated at all doses tested. Additionally, there were no observed adverse interactions with any concomitant diabetes medications used by patients during the trial. Because AR converts glucose to sorbitol, and AR activity is elevated in diabetic patients, sorbitol normalization to healthy subject levels can be used as a PD biomarker of target engagement and proof of biological activity. Treatment with AT-001 normalized sorbitol levels in diabetic patients to those of healthy volunteers, and prevented post-prandial elevations in sorbitol. Decrease in sorbitol levels was dose-dependent, with higher doses of AT-001 resulting in greater reduction in sorbitol levels. Reduction in sorbitol levels lasted for approximately 10-12 hours post dose, suggesting that twice-daily oral dosing produced optimal pharmacodynamic impact. Placebo-treated patients did not demonstrate any reduction in sorbitol levels, and conversely demonstrated post-prandial increase in sorbitol levels. 
Within the Phase 1/2 study, approximately 30 patients with early stage DbCM, assessed by echocardiographic abnormalities and elevations in the cardiac stress biomarker, NTproBNP, were treated with AT-001 or placebo for 28 days. Treatment with AT-001 (twice daily or three times daily) resulted in sustained reduction in sorbitol, and significant reduction in NTproBNP, demonstrating that inhibition of AR decreases cardiac stress. This data supported dose selection and advancement into a Phase 2/3 registrational trial for DbCM.
In September 2019, we initiated a Phase 3 registrational trial for AT-001 in DbCM called ARISE-HF. ARISE-HF is a global study, recruiting patients at sites in North America, Europe, Australia and Hong Kong. The primary endpoint of the trial is stabilization or decrease in slope of decline on functional capacity, as measured by peak VO2, the rate of oxygen consumption measured during exercise. We are also evaluating heart function by echocardiogram-based hemodynamic endpoints, progression to overt heart failure, and quality of life, as well as biomarkers of heart inflammation and damage. This trial consists of 675 patients in three cohorts of approximately 225 patients each, including a placebo group, a low dose AT-001 group (1,000mg twice daily) and a high dose AT-001 group (1,500mg 

15



twice daily). The trial treatment period for evaluation of the primary endpoint is 15 months, with additional endpoints evaluated at 27 months. The trial is fully enrolled and ongoing.
AT-001 for the Treatment of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy
Overview
We also intend to develop AT-001 for DPN, a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that significantly reduces patients’ quality of life, and for which there are currently no FDA-approved treatments. We expect this indication will require a standard clinical development path, and as such we plan to pursue a strategic partnership in order to expand into this indication. Since many patients with DbCM also have DPN, we are collecting proof-of-concept data through our DbCM program to support our efforts in our DPN program. We have included a DPN sub-study in our pivotal DbCM study.
Diagnosis and Current Standard of Care
DPN is diagnosed by a simple neurological assessment, usually the Toronto Neuropathy Scoring System, which is administered in the physician’s office and examines a patient’s ability to feel various types of neurological stimuli on the hands and feet. AR activity has been shown to cause DPN. Epalrestat, an ARI, is approved in Japan, China and India to prevent further neuronal degeneration in DPN patients. However, there are no disease modifying therapies approved in the United States and Europe, and only symptomatic medications, such as Lyrica, are approved for pain associated with DPN. Although epalrestat was approved in Japan in 1992 based on very limited clinical data that would not have been sufficient for other markets, more recent academic studies have demonstrated an effect on MNCV and symptomatic pain endpoints in a wide range of diabetic patients. For example, a multicenter, three-year Phase 3 clinical trial conducted in Japan on epalrestat 150 mg versus placebo demonstrated that epalrestat prevented progression of DPN in diabetic patients versus placebo. Epalrestat prevented degeneration of nerve function, as measured by MNCV, and prevented worsening of symptomatic pain. A statistically significant effect was demonstrated in all patients regardless of low or high levels of glucose attached to their hemoglobin, as tested by a hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) test.
Epalrestat, which is now generic in Japan, reached peak sales of approximately $226 million in 2001. This is indicative of its widespread use in the Japanese diabetic population, which was approximately five million patients at the time of launch despite significant tolerability issues associated with use and five times daily dosing due to a very short half-life. We do not believe, however, that it is likely to be a candidate for further commercialization. Nevertheless, prior research on epalrestat evinces the role of AR in DPN and provides a clinical trial design to demonstrate efficacy in this indication.
Market Opportunity
Approximately 50% of the global diabetic population, or 226 million diabetic patients, suffer from DPN, with 23.0 million patients in North America and 29.0 million patients in Europe. Due to availability of generic epalrestat in China and India, we view the opportunity in these two markets to be limited as a result of pricing pressures and differentiation requirements with regard to epalrestat. However, we believe a significant market opportunity for a more effective ARI with a favorable dosing regimen still exists in Japan, a less price sensitive market where there is familiarity with the mechanism of action in the disease and use of epalrestat is high. As such, although we are currently focused on the U.S. market, we may expand our efforts into Japan opportunistically.
Preclinical Studies
In preclinical studies, AT-001 prevented neuronal degeneration in animal models of DPN, as measured by MNCV in sciatic and tail nerves of diabetic rats. AT-001 treatment prevented peripheral neuronal damage, as measured by MNCV after six weeks of treatment. A dose-dependent reduction in neuronal dysfunction was observed in rats treated 

16



with AT-001, and treatment at 30 mg/kg of AT-001 completely prevented neuronal degeneration, with no statistical difference from non-diabetic WT rats.
Clinical Development
Since many DbCM patients often also suffer from DPN, we have incorporated DPN endpoints, such as MNCV, as a sub-study into our DbCM ARISE-HF pivotal study to provide additional proof-of-concept for AT-001 in DPN. We plan to seek a strategic partnership to develop AT-001 for treatment of DPN and advance the program into Phase 3 clinical trial for this indication.
AT-003 for the Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy
Overview
We are developing AT-003, an ARI designed to cross through the back of the eye when dosed orally, which has demonstrated strong retinal penetrance, for the treatment of DR. DR is an ophthalmic disease that occurs in diabetic patients, and for which treatments are currently limited to intravitreal administration. DR has been linked to AR activity, including elevations in sorbitol and subsequent changes in retinal blood vessels, which distorts vision and leads to permanent blindness. We are currently in late stages of preclinical development and intend to advance AT-003 into a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of DR.
Diagnosis and Current Standard of Care
DR is diagnosed by routine dilated eye exam by an ophthalmologist. Annual or biennial ophthalmic exams to screen for DR are a recommended standard of care for diabetic patients under current treatment guidelines. Vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, inhibitors, Lucentis (ranibizumab) and Eylea (aflibercept), are approved to treat severe or late-stage DR, but are limited by high cost, the need for intravitreal injection into the eye and the lack of therapeutic benefit in many patients. A need exists for safe, effective and tolerable treatments for DR early in the disease process that provide a benefit to a wide range of patients. AR is an attractive target for DR drug development since AR activity is upstream of VEGF activity in DR pathogenesis. AR has been shown to cause DR by inducing hyperosmolarity in retinal cells due to elevated sorbitol, as well as through fructose-mediated detrimental downstream effects, such as AGE generation and PKC activation. AR knock-out rats are protected from DR development, and several prior ARIs demonstrated efficacy on DR endpoints in clinical trials, but were not approved due to dose-limiting safety concerns.
Market Opportunity
A recent retrospective epidemiological analysis of diabetic patients globally confirmed that DR affects approximately 35% of diabetics, and is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Based on the 2017 diabetes numbers, the global market for DR is approximately 158 million patients, with anticipated increase to 243 million by 2045. The current market is approximately 16.0 million in North America and 20.0 million in Europe.
Preclinical Studies
AT-003 displayed significant retinal penetration when dosed orally in diabetic rats. AT-003 was observed to be well tolerated over a seven-day dosing period in all doses tested, up to 1,000 mg/kg daily, with no adverse effects observed. Efficacy of AT-003 is currently being explored in two animal models of DR — an ischemic injury model (acute damage) and chronic diabetic treatment model.
Clinical Development Plan
Similar to AT-001, we plan to explore the safety, tolerability, PK profile and biomarker effects of AT-003 in a Phase 1a/1b clinical trial in diabetic patients. Assuming positive data in this trial, we plan to initiate a pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trial of AT-003 in patients with DR to prevent disease progression versus placebo, as measured by subjective 

17



metrics, including fluoroscein angiography and optical coherence tomography, which are scans used in the examination and management of retinal diseases.

License Agreement with Advanz Pharma
On January 3, 2023, we entered into an Exclusive License and Supply Agreement (the “ Advanz Agreement”)
with Mercury Pharma Group Limited (trading as Advanz Pharma Holdings). Pursuant to the Agreement, we granted Advanz Pharma the exclusive right and license to commercialize drug products containing AT-007 (also known as govorestat), our proprietary Aldose Reductase Inhibitor (ARI) (the “Licensed Product”), for use in treatment of Sorbitol Dehydrogenase Deficiency (“SORD”) and Galactosemia (each a “Licensed Indication”) in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (the “Territory”). We also granted Advanz Pharma a right of negotiation and “most-favored nation” rights with respect to acquiring the European commercialization rights for any additional indications for which the Licensed Product may be developed in the future (or any other products we may develop solely to the extent used for the Licensed Indications).

20



​
Advanz Pharma is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to launch and commercialize the Licensed Products in the major markets in the Territory in each Licensed Indication following, and subject to, receipt of marketing authorization therein. Under the Advanz Agreement, Advanz Pharma agreed to pay us (i) an upfront payment of EUR 10
million (approx. USD $10.7 million), and certain development milestone payments upon clinical trial completions and
receipt of marketing authorization in the territory, as well as certain commercial milestone payments, totaling EUR 134
million (approx. USD $142.2 million) in the aggregate, and (ii) royalties of 20% of net sales of the Licensed Product. Such royalty rate will be payable on a country-by-country basis until the later of (i) the expiration of the licensed patents covering the composition of matter of AT-007, or (ii) 10 years after the European Medicines Agency’s grant of marketing authorization for the Licensed Product. The royalties are subject to certain deductions, including certain secondary finishing costs, certain step-in establishment costs and a portion of fees for any potential third party patent licenses if applicable in the future. Following the initial term of the license, as described above, the royalty rate shall be reduced to 10% and shall continue in perpetuity unless the Agreement is terminated in various circumstances in accordance with its terms.
​
Certain of the patents licensed to Advanz Pharma under the Advanz Agreement are sub-licensed from the University of Miami and Columbia University, and thus remain subject to certain obligations of the Company (including
royalty obligations) to such institutions. For more information on these arrangements see “—Exclusive License Agreement with Columbia University” and “—License Agreements with the University of Miami.”
​
Sales and Marketing
Due to the delay in the anticipated Galactosemia commercial launch, external non-essential commercial expenditures have been suspended, including sales and marketing, and we have recognized significant reductions in our commercial spending during the year ended December 31, 2022.
​
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We depend on third party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for all of our requirements of raw materials, drug substance and drug product for our preclinical research and our clinical trials for AT-007, AT-001 and AT-003. We have not entered into long-term agreements with our current CMOs. We intend to continue to rely on CMOs for later-stage development and commercialization of our current products, as well as the development and commercialization of any other product candidates that we may identify. Although we rely on CMOs, we have personnel and third party consultants with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our contract manufacturers.
We believe the synthesis of the drug substance for AT-007 and AT-001 are reliable and reproducible from readily available starting materials, and the synthetic routes are amenable to large-scale production and do not require unusual equipment or handling in the manufacturing process. We have obtained adequate supplies of the drug substance for AT-007 and AT-001 to satisfy our immediate clinical and preclinical demands.
Drug product formulation development for AT-007 and AT-001 are in progress. We have contracted with a third party manufacturer capable of both formulation development and drug product manufacturing through commercialization. We may identify a second drug product manufacturer in the future to add additional capacity and redundancy to our supply chain. 
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, the expertise of our executive and scientific team, research, clinical capabilities, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. 

21



Product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
There are currently no therapies approved to treat Galactosemia. Two companies have announced plans for preclinical or conceptual programs to develop gene therapies in Galactosemia. We believe these potential AAV gene therapies are several years away from entering the clinic, and there is no data to date in preclinical or clinical studies demonstrating efficacy or safety. Additionally, due to safety issues associated with AAV gene therapy in general, and the fact that Galactosemia is a debilitating but not life-threatening disease, we do not believe that the risk appetite of parents or physicians will support substantial competition from gene therapies. 
There are currently no therapies approved for SORD Deficiency. There are no drugs in development to our knowledge outside of AT-007, and we believe that the IP licensed from University of Miami is sufficiently broad to encompass the entire class of aldose reductase inhibitors for treatment of SORD Deficiency.
There are currently no therapies approved to treat DbCM. Sponsors of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2, or SGLT2, inhibitors are pursuing broad cardiovascular labels in type 2 diabetes patients, which may include a subset of DbCM patients as part of the larger diabetic population at risk for heart failure. Many of these programs are sponsored by large pharmaceutical companies with a strong presence in cardiology and metabolic disease. There have been prior studies demonstrating effectiveness in DbCM of off-label use of sildenafil, although we do not believe this represents a commercially viable competitive threat.
There are no disease modifying therapies approved to treat DPN outside of Japan, India and China. In these limited markets, epalrestat, another ARI, is approved to prevent worsening of DPN, and despite challenges in compliance due to frequent dosing three to five times daily, the drugs are generic and offer a low cost alternative. A more effective therapy with improved tolerability and dosing may offer an advantage. A re-formulation of proprietary crystalline epalrestat, BNV-222, is in development for DPN in Russia in a 12-month Phase 2/3 clinical trial, which completed enrollment in 2016, but has not yet reported any results.
There are several therapies approved to treat severe or late-stage forms of DR, or proliferative DR, such as diabetic macular edema and proliferative DR, including anti-VEGF therapies, Lucentis and Eylea, which represents approximately 20% of the larger DR population. There are currently no therapies approved to treat non-proliferative DR, an earlier stage of the disease upstream of vessel or capillary proliferation. However, there are significant additional clinical development efforts for other mechanistic interventions in early-stage or for non-proliferative DR.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, new therapeutic approaches and potential indications, and other inventions that are important to our business. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important for the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how that is not patentable, we rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. We require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information 

22



and requiring disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
Our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications that are exclusively licensed from Columbia University and patent applications that are owned by us. Our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications that cover our product candidates AT-007, AT-001, and AT-003, and the use of these candidates for therapeutic purposes in certain territories. Our proprietary technology has been developed primarily through relationships with academic research centers and contract research organizations.
For our product candidates, we will, in general, initially pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter and methods of use. Throughout the development of our product candidates, we seek to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including through additional methods of use, process of making, formulation and dosing regimen-related claims.
In total, our patent portfolio, including patents licensed from Columbia University and patents owned by us, comprises nine different patent families, filed in various jurisdictions worldwide, including families directed to composition of matter for AR inhibitors, and families directed to methods of treating Galactosemia and complications associated with Galactosemia, SORD Deficiency and PMM2-CDG using AR inhibitors. Our patent portfolio includes issued patents in the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and other jurisdictions. Our patent portfolio is outlined below:
Composition of Matter Patents
AT-007. We have exclusively licensed a patent family from Columbia University that includes two issued composition of matter patents and two issued method use of patents in the United States, and 40 issued patents in Europe, Japan, Australia, India, Israel, China, Mexico and South Africa, that claim the composition of matter of and certain methods of use with respect to AT 007. In addition, we have pending patent applications in the United States, Europe, Japan, China, Canada, Australia, Russia, Brazil, India, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, and Hong Kong. The 20-year term of patents in this family runs through June 2037, absent any available patent term adjustments or extensions.
AT-001 and AT-003. We have exclusively licensed from Columbia University a patent family that includes five issued patents in the United States, 82 issued patents in Europe, Japan, Canada, and Australia, a pending application in the United States and a pending application in Europe that claim the composition of matter of and certain methods of use with respect to AT-001 and AT-003. The 20-year term of the patents in this family runs through July 2031, absent any available patent term adjustments or extensions.
Methods for Treating Galactosemia
We own a family of patent applications that claims methods for treating Galactosemia and preventing complications associated with Galactosemia using AT-007 and other inhibitors of AR. This family currently includes granted patents in the United States and Mexico, and pending patent application in the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, and Hong Kong. The 20-year term of patents in this family run through July 2038, absent any available patent term adjustments or extensions.
Methods for Treating SORD Deficiencies
We own a family of patent applications that claims methods for treating SORD Deficiency using AT-007 and other inhibitors of AR. This family currently includes pending patent applications in the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea. No patents have issued to date, but we expect that the 20-year term of any patents that do issue in this family will run through 2041, absent any available patent term adjustments or extensions.

23



We have exclusively licensed a patent family from University of Miami that includes pending applications in the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, India, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea and Hong Kong, that claims methods for treating inherited neuropathy using a variety of therapeutic modalities including inhibitors of AR. This patent family is owned by University of Miami, University of Rochester and UCL Business Ltd. and licensed to us by University of Miami pursuant to an exclusive agency granted to University of Miami, by University of Rochester and UCL Business Ltd. No patents have issued to date, but we expect that the 20-year term of any patents that do grant in this family will run through 2040, absent any available patent term adjustments or extensions.
​
Methods for Treating PMM2-CDG
We own a family of patent applications that claim methods for treating PMM2-CDG using AT-007 and other inhibitors of AR. This family currently includes pending patent application in the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and Hong Kong. No patents have issued to date, but we expect that the 20-year term of any patents that do grant in this family will run through 2040, absent any available patent term adjustments or extensions.
We expect to file future patent applications on innovations that are developed in the course of advancing our pipeline through preclinical and clinical development.
Patent Term and Term Extensions
Individual patents have terms for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications filed in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In addition, in certain instances, the term of a U.S. patent can be extended to recapture a portion of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the restoration period cannot extend the patent term beyond 14 years from FDA approval. In addition, only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method of manufacturing may be extended. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. All taxes, annuities or maintenance fees for a patent, as required by the USPTO and various foreign jurisdictions, must be timely paid in order for the patent to remain in force during this period of time.
The actual protection afforded by a patent may vary on a product by product basis, from country to country, and can depend upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions and the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Our patents and patent applications may be subject to procedural or legal challenges by others. We may be unable to obtain, maintain and protect the intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business, and we may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, which could materially harm our business. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Trademarks and Know-How
In connection with the ongoing development and advancement of our products and services in the United States and various international jurisdictions, we seek to create protection for our marks and enhance their value by pursuing trademarks and service marks where available and when appropriate. In addition to patent and trademark protection, we rely upon know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We 

24



seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed by our employees and through relationships with third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors, commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, quality control, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
United States Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to delays and a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve a pending New Drug Application, or NDA, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA for marketing approval, which must include data from preclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25




● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | payment of user fees; and
--+--------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold or a partial clinical hold.
In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted and reapprove the study at least annually. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, or FDORA, which was signed into law on December 29, 2022, made numerous amendments to the FDCA including provisions intended to, among other things, decentralize and modernize clinical trials and enhance diversity in clinical trial populations.
​
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted, at least annually, to the FDA, and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product, and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate 

26



approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements, or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes 12 months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. The FDA may further extend the review process for three additional months to consider new information provided by the applicant to address any outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including component manufacturing, finished product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and takes several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be 

27



susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000, there is no reasonable expectation that sales of the drug in the United States will be sufficient to offset the costs of developing and making the drug available in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If the FDA approves a sponsor’s marketing application for a designated orphan drug for use in the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the sponsor is eligible for a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, during which the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for a drug with the same active moiety and intended for the same use or indication as the approved orphan drug, except in limited circumstances, such as if a subsequent sponsor demonstrates its product is clinically superior. During a sponsor’s orphan drug exclusivity period, competitors, however, may receive approval for drugs with different active moieties for the same indication as the approved orphan drug, or for drugs with the same active moiety as the approved orphan drug, but for different indications. Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for a drug with the same active moiety intended for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that grounds for withdrawal of the orphan drug exclusivity exist, such as that our product is clinically superior. Further, if a designated orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the rare disease or condition for which it received orphan drug designation, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an 

28



unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted. The FDA may do so if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that are designed to treat serious conditions, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, these six and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
Rare pediatric disease, or RPD, designation by the FDA enables priority review voucher, or PRV, eligibility upon U.S. market approval of a designated drug for rare pediatric diseases. The RPD-PRV program is intended to encourage development of therapies to prevent and treat rare pediatric diseases. The voucher, which is awarded upon NDA or Biologics License Application, or BLA, approval to the sponsor of a designated RPD can be sold or transferred to another entity and used by the holder to receive priority review for a future NDA or BLA submission, which reduces the FDA review time of such future submission from ten to six months. The RPD-PRV program is currently scheduled to sunset as of September 30, 2026.
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval. To qualify, the FDA must determine that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. Among FDORA’s provisions are amendments to the accelerated approval program, including new requirements relating to post-approval studies and enhanced enforcement and withdrawal authorities for the FDA.
​
Breakthrough therapy designation is for a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or other labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing 

29



annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. 
Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other regulatory requirements.
The FDA may also subject a drug to official lot release, which requires manufacturers to submit several items to the FDA with respect to each lot of a drug before it is released to distribution. These items include samples of each lot, a summary of the manufacturing history of the lot and the results of any tests performed on the lot.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting their promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative liability.

30



In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our current and future business operations, including our clinical research activities and proposed sales, marketing and education programs and constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers and other parties through which we may market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those laws described below.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties laws.
Federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced by individuals through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and 

31



Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose specified requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouses and health plans, that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which are not pre-empted by HIPAA, differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State legislatures are increasingly focused on pharmaceutical company activities, and we may be subject to additional new state or federal legislative requirements in the future that could impact our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if they are approved.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties including damages, fines, individual imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our product candidates are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, implementation of corporate compliance programs, reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals, and additional data privacy and security requirements.
Coverage and Reimbursement
The future commercial success of our product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which third party payors, such as governmental payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third party payors, provide coverage of and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our product candidates. Third party payors generally decide which products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for those products. In particular, in the United States, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists. Private health insurers and other third party payors often provide coverage and reimbursement for products based on the level at which the government, through the Medicare program, provides coverage and reimbursement for such products, but also on their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.

32



In the United States, the European Union, or EU, and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of products, particularly for new and innovative products, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general.
Third party payors are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for products. For example, federal and state governments reimburse products at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of products. Third party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of products, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third party payor reimbursement may not be available to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage and reimbursement. The cost containment measures that third party payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates.
Healthcare Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates. The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, if approved. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts, which include major legislative initiatives to reduce the cost of care through changes in the healthcare system, including limits on the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded healthcare programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.
There have been several U.S. government initiatives over the past few years to fund and incentivize certain comparative effectiveness research, including creation of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the PPACA. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates.
The PPACA became law in March 2010 and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by third party payors, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Among other measures that may have an impact on our business, the PPACA establishes an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Additionally, the PPACA extends manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability, expands eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, and expands entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service Act. 

33



In addition to these provisions, the Affordable Care Act established a number of bodies whose work may have a future impact on the market for certain pharmaceutical products. These include the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, established to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. At this time, we are unsure of the full impact that the PPACA will have on our business.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA and we expect such challenges and amendments to continue. Former President Trump implemented certain directives designed to delay the implementation of certain PPACA provisions or otherwise circumvent requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA, while Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, bills affecting the implementation of the PPACA have been signed into law. For example, the Tax Act includes a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 19, 2020, former President Trump signed a bill that repealed the PPACA’s so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” In December 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. In December 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the lower court decision, which was then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court held that state and individual plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the individual mandate provision of the PPACA; in so holding, the Supreme Court did not consider larger constitutional questions about the validity of this provision or the validity of the PPACA in its entirety. Another case challenging the PPACA’s requirement that private insurers cover certain preventative services is currently pending before the same U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas who ruled against the individual mandate in 2018. In September 2022, the judge held that certain preventative services violated the U.S. Constitution and set a schedule for additional briefing regarding the scope of the remedy. That briefing was completed in January 2023 and it is unclear when or how the court will rule. It is also unclear how this or any potential future litigation and other efforts to repeal and replace the PPACA will impact the PPACA, or our business.
​
Further, there has been increasing legislative, executive branch, and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. With respect to executive branch actions, the former Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contained proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The HHS has implemented some of these measures under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs, beginning January 1, 2020. Although a number of these and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Biden administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, enacted on August 16, 2022, seeks to reduce prescription drug costs by, among other provisions, allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for certain high-cost prescription drugs in Medicare Parts B and D, imposing an excise tax on pharmaceutical manufacturers that refuse to negotiate pricing with Medicare, requiring inflation rebates to limit annual drug price increases in Medicare, redesigning the Medicare Part D formula, and limiting the cost-sharing for insulin products. It is unclear whether additional drug pricing and other healthcare reform measures will be enacted, and if enacted, what effect they would have on our business.

34



At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs. These measures could reduce future demand for our products or put pressure on our pricing.
Additionally, in May 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. For example, in the EU, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application, or CTA, in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Facilities
We are currently in a five-year lease for the space for our principal executive offices in New York, New York and a three-year lease for the offices in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our current needs.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
Investing in, developing, and maintaining human capital is critical to our success. As of December 31, 2022, we had 27 full-time employees, 18 of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities. A total of ten employees have an M.D. or Ph.D. degree. We emphasize a number of measures and objectives in managing our human capital assets, including, among others, employee safety and wellness, talent acquisition and retention, employee engagement, development and training, diversity and inclusion and compensation and pay equity. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good. 
Our human capital resource objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees and advisors. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel and increase our success and stockholder value thereby.
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees. Accordingly, we are committed to their health, safety and wellness.
