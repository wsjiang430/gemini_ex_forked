     Nabors Industries, Ltd. (NYSE: NBR) was formed as a Bermuda exempted company on December 11, 2001. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this annual report to “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” or “Nabors” mean Nabors Industries Ltd., together with our subsidiaries where the context requires. References in this annual report to “Nabors Delaware” mean Nabors Industries, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Nabors.     Overview
     Since its founding in 1952, Nabors has grown from a small land drilling business in Canada to one of the world’s largest drilling contractors. Today, Nabors owns and operates one of the world’s largest land-based drilling rig fleets and is a provider of offshore rigs in the United States and numerous international markets. Nabors also provides directional drilling services, tubular services, performance tools, and innovative technologies for its own rig fleet and those of third parties. In today’s performance-driven environment, we believe we are well positioned to seamlessly integrate downhole hardware, surface equipment and software solutions into our AC rig designs. Leveraging our advanced drilling automation capabilities, Nabors’ highly skilled workforce continues to set new standards for operational excellence and transform our industry.
     Our business is comprised of our global land-based and offshore drilling rig operations and other rig related services and technologies, consisting of equipment manufacturing, rig instrumentation and optimization software. We also specialize in tubular services, wellbore placement solutions and are a leading provider of directional drilling and measurement while drilling (“MWD”) systems and services. 
     Our business consists of five reportable segments:  U.S. Drilling, Canada Drilling, International Drilling, Drilling Solutions and Rig Technologies. 
     With operations in over 25 countries, we are a global provider of drilling and drilling-related services for land-based and offshore oil and natural gas wells, with a fleet of rigs and drilling-related equipment which, as of December 31, 2018 included:
    
· | 384 actively marketed rigs for land-based drilling operations in the United States, Canada and approximately 18 other countries throughout the world; and

     Additional information regarding the geographic markets in which we operate and our business segments can be found in Note 21—Segment Information in Part II, Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
     U.S. Drilling
     Our U.S. Drilling operations include land drilling activities in the lower 48 states and Alaska as well as offshore drilling activities in the Gulf of Mexico. We operate one of the largest land-based drilling rig fleets in the United States, consisting of 188 AC rigs and 22 SCR rigs which were actively marketed as of December 31, 2018. 
     Nabors’ first AC land rig was built during 2002. Since then, the AC rig technology has significantly evolved as more than 900 AC rigs have been added to the U.S. land market. As the industry shifted to multi well pad drilling, operators demanded greater efficiencies and adaptability through batch drilling. We believe our latest generation of PACE® drilling rigs are ideal for batch drilling, with pad optimal features, such as our proprietary side saddle design, and advanced walking capabilities. 
     In 2013, we introduced our PACE®-X800 rig with an advanced walking system that enables the rig to move quickly over existing wells, along the X and Y axes. Most of the ancillary equipment moves with the rig, enabling it to move easily between adjacent rows of wells. 
     During the second half of 2016, we introduced our PACE®-M800 and PACE®-M1000 rigs which complement our existing PACE®-X800 rigs. The PACE®-M800 rig is designed for lower-density multi-well pads whereas the PACE®-M1000 is designed for higher density pads. Both are designed to move rapidly between pads. Featuring the same advanced walking capabilities as the PACE®-X800 rig, the PACE®-M800 rig can quickly move efficiently on pads and over short distances, with minimal rig-up and rig-down components.
     In addition to land drilling operations throughout the lower 48 states and Alaska, we also actively marketed 12 platform rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as of December 31, 2018. 
     Canada Drilling
     Our rig fleet consisted of 41 land-based drilling rigs in Canada as of December 31, 2018. Over the past few years, the Canada market has moved away from the conventional drilling of vertical wells and now focuses virtually exclusively on horizontal wells. Our focus in recent years has been on the market for larger, more capable rigs. The majority of our work in Canada is in this market segment.     International Drilling
     We maintain a footprint in nearly every major oil and gas market across the globe, most notably in Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Argentina, Colombia, Kazakhstan and Venezuela. Many of our rigs in our international drilling markets were designed to address the challenges inherent in specific drilling locations such as those required in the desert and remote or environmentally sensitive locations, as well as the various shale plays. As of December 31, 2018, our international fleet consisted of 133 land-based drilling rigs in approximately 18 countries. We also actively marketed 18 platforms and three jackup rigs in the international offshore drilling markets as of the same date. We continue to upgrade

      Rig Technologies
     Our Rig Technologies segment is primarily comprised of Canrig, which manufactures and sells top drives, catwalks, wrenches, drawworks and other drilling related equipment such as robotic systems and downhole tools which are installed on both onshore and offshore drilling rigs. Rig Technologies also provides aftermarket sales and services for the installed base of its equipment.       Our Business Strategy
     Our business strategy is to build shareholder value and enhance our competitive position by:
    
· | achieving superior operational and health, safety and environmental performance;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  6

 

    
· | leveraging our existing global infrastructure and operating reputation to capitalize on growth opportunities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | continuing to develop our existing portfolio of value-added services to our customers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | enhancing our technology position and advancing drilling technology both on the rig and downhole; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | achieving returns above our cost of capital.
--+---------------------------------------------

      During 2018 we achieved several milestones in our drive to automate and integrate the well construction process. As the industry recovered from the severe downturn that began in 2014, we believe the investments we have made in our rigs and related technology and equipment are all paying off. We are focused on drilling the most productive, efficient and safe wells to our clients’ specifications, engineered for highly complex and demanding geology.
     Our global fleet of 417 rigs is the fundamental platform for our business. We enter 2019 with nearly 100 Nabors SmartRig™ units deployed in the U.S. Lower 48, and contracted commitments to deploy an additional eight units during the first half of 2019. Our new PACE®-M750 rig was introduced in early 2018, as a significant, and capital efficient, retrofit to the existing PACE®-M550. This design bolsters capabilities for faster drilling, improved mobility and extended reach at a fraction of the cost of a newbuild unit.
     During 2018, we made further progress commercializing our drilling technology portfolio. We believe this positions us well to address the changing market dynamic both in the United States and internationally. Our technological development efforts drive toward a seamless integration of the rig’s operations with downhole sensing. In addition, we are adding complementary services to our traditional rig offering and in many cases replacing third-party providers of these complementary services as a single service provider. 
     In late 2018, Nabors acquired PetroMar Technologies, a developer and operator of downhole LWD tools that focuses on high-value formation data to facilitate well completion optimization. The addition of PetroMar expands the Company’s portfolio of value-added services.
     Oil prices declined sharply during the fourth quarter of 2018. This volatility has driven certain exploration and production companies in the U.S. to announce reductions in planned year-over-year capital spending for 2019. We have positioned the Company for this volatility, while still pursuing the primary goal of reducing net debt in 2019. As the year begins, Nabors holds contracts to deploy additional drilling rigs during 2019 with multiple customers in our global markets.   
     Drilling Contracts
     Our drilling contracts are typically daywork contracts. A daywork contract generally provides for a basic rate per day when drilling (the dayrate for providing a rig and crew) and for lower rates when the rig is moving between drilling locations, or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond our control. In addition, daywork contracts may provide for a lump-sum fee for the mobilization and demobilization of the rig, which in most cases approximates our anticipated costs. A daywork contract differs from a footage contract (in which the drilling contractor is paid on the basis of a rate per foot drilled) and a turnkey contract (in which the drilling contractor is paid for drilling a well to a specified depth for a fixed price). We also offer performance enhancing drilling services, performance software and equipment such as managed pressure services, directional drilling, rotary steering systems and measurement while drilling. These additional products and services are additive to our rig charges.
     Our contracts for land-based and offshore drilling have durations that are single-well, multi-well or term. Term contracts generally have durations ranging from six months to five years. Under term contracts, our rigs are committed to one customer. Offshore workover projects are often contracted on a single-well basis. We generally receive drilling contracts through competitive bidding, although we occasionally enter into contracts by direct negotiation. Most of our single-well contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice, while multi-well contracts and term contracts may provide us with early termination compensation in certain circumstances. Such payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract, and in certain circumstances the customer may not be obligated, able or willing to make an early termination payment to us. Contract terms and rates differ depending on a variety of factors, including 

 
  7

 
competitive conditions, the geographical area, the geological formation to be drilled, the equipment and services to be supplied, the on-site drilling conditions and the anticipated duration of the work to be performed. 
     Our Customers
     Our customers include major international, national and independent oil and gas companies. One customer, Saudi Aramco, accounted for approximately 24%, 29% and 33% of our consolidated operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which operating revenues are primarily included in the results of our International Drilling reportable segment. Our contracts with Saudi Aramco are on a per rig basis. These contracts are primarily operated through SANAD, our joint venture with Saudi Aramco. See Part I, Item
 1A.—Risk Factors—The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
     Our Employees
     As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 15,000 people in approximately 25 countries. Our number of employees fluctuates depending on the current and expected demand for our services. Some rig-based employees in Alaska, Argentina, Mexico and Venezuela are represented by collective bargaining units. We believe our relationship with our employees is generally good.     Seasonality
     Our operations are subject to seasonal factors. Specifically, our drilling operations in Canada and Alaska generally experience reduced levels of activity and financial results during the second quarter of each year, due to the annual spring thaw. In addition, our U.S. offshore market can be impacted during summer months by tropical weather systems in the Gulf of Mexico. Global climate change could lengthen these periods of reduced activity, but we cannot currently estimate to what degree. Our overall financial results reflect the seasonal variations experienced in these operations, but seasonality does not materially impact the remaining portions of our business.
     Industry/Competitive Conditions
     To a large degree, our businesses depend on the level of capital spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. The level of exploration, development and production activities is to a large extent tied to the prices of oil and natural gas, which can fluctuate significantly and are highly volatile. For example, oil prices were as high as $107 per barrel during 2014 and reached a near ten-year low of $26 per barrel in February 2016. Oil prices began to stabilize during 2017 and steadily increased throughout much of 2018, hitting a four-year high of $76 per barrel in September. However, during the fourth quarter of 2018, oil prices declined dramatically to a low of $42 per barrel. A decrease or prolonged decline in the price of oil or natural gas or in the exploration, development and production activities of our customers could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services and/or a reduction in dayrates and utilization, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Part I, Item 1A.—Risk Factors— Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability, and—Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment and Item 7.— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
     The markets in which we provide our services are highly competitive. We believe that competitive pricing is a significant factor in determining which service provider is awarded a job in these markets and customers are increasingly sensitive to pricing during periods of market instability. Historically, the number of available rigs and drilling-related equipment has exceeded demand in many of the markets in which we operate, resulting in strong price competition. This is due in part to the fact that most rigs and drilling-related equipment can be readily moved from one region to another in response to changes in the levels of exploration, development and production activities and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas.
     Although many rigs can be readily moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and many of the total available contracts are currently awarded on a bid basis, competition has increased based on the supply of existing and new rigs across all of our markets. Most available contracts for our services are currently awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price.

     In addition to price, other competitive factors in the markets we serve are the overall quality of service and safety record, the technical specification and condition of equipment, the availability of skilled personnel and the ability to offer ancillary services. Our drilling business is subject to certain additional competitive factors. For example, we believe our ability to deliver rigs with new technology and features and, in certain international markets, our experience operating in certain environments and strong customer relationships have been significant factors in the selection of Nabors for the provision of drilling services. We expect that the market for our drilling services will continue to be highly competitive. See Part I, Item 1A.—Risk Factors—We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
     Certain competitors are present in more than one of the markets in which we operate, although no one competitor operates in all such markets. We compete with (1) Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. and several other competitors with national, regional or local rig operations in the United States, (2) Saipem S.p.A, KCA Deutag and various contractors in our international markets and (3) Precision Drilling, Ensign Energy Services, and others in Canada.
     Acquisitions and Divestitures
     We have grown from a land drilling business centered in the U.S. Lower 48, Canada and Alaska to an international business with operations on land and offshore in most of the major oil and gas markets in the world. At the beginning of 1990, our fleet consisted of 44 actively marketed land drilling rigs in Canada, Alaska and in various international markets. Today, our worldwide fleet of actively marketed rigs consists of 384 land drilling rigs, 30 offshore platform rigs and three jackup units. This growth was fueled in part by strategic acquisitions. While we continuously consider and review strategic opportunities, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, alliances and other strategic transactions, there can be no assurance that such opportunities will continue to be available, that the pricing will be economical or that we will be successful in completing and realizing the expected benefits of such transactions in the future.
     We may sell a subsidiary or group of assets outside of our core markets or business if it is strategically or economically advantageous for us to do so. We undertook the following strategic transactions over the last three years.
     During 2016, we entered into an agreement with Saudi Aramco, to form a new joint venture, SANAD, to own, manage and operate onshore drilling rigs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. SANAD, which is equally owned by Saudi Aramco and Nabors, began operations in the fourth quarter of 2017. The joint venture leverages our established business in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on Saudi Arabia's existing and future onshore oil and gas fields.
     In September 2017 we paid approximately $50.7 million in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments, to acquire Robotic Drilling Systems AS (“RDS”), a provider of automated tubular and tool handling equipment for the onshore and offshore drilling markets based in Stavanger, Norway. This transaction will allow us to integrate RDS’s highly capable team and product offering with the technology portfolio of Canrig, and strengthens the development of Canrig’s drilling automation solutions. 
     In December 2017, we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Tesco in an all-stock transaction. Tesco shareholders received 0.68 common shares of Nabors for each Tesco share owned, or approximately 32.1 million Nabors common shares. Tesco was a provider of products such as top drives and automated pipe handling equipment as well as tubular services to upstream companies. The combination of Tesco with Nabors’ current product offerings strengthens our ability to accelerate and scale deployment in drilling automation and analytics.
     In October 2018, we purchased PetroMar Technologies, a small developer and operator of LWD downhole tools focusing on high-value formation data to facilitate completion optimization particularly in unconventional reservoirs. The tools complement our existing wellbore placement capabilities and are included in our Drilling Solutions operating segment. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid an initial purchase price of $25.0 million. We may also be required to make future payments that are contingent upon the future financial performance of this operation.

 Environmental Compliance
     We do not anticipate that compliance with currently applicable environmental rules and regulations and controls will significantly change our competitive position, capital spending or earnings during 2019. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental rules and regulations and that the cost of such compliance is not material to our business or financial condition. For a more detailed description of the environmental rules and regulations applicable to our operations, see Part I, Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Changes to or noncompliance with governmental laws and regulations or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.
