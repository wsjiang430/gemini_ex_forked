 Overview
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of engineered T cell therapies that have the potential to provide a deep and durable, perhaps curative, treatment for patients with autoimmune diseases. The Cabaletta Approach to B cell Ablation, or our CABA platform, encompasses two strategies – chimeric antigen receptor T cells for autoimmunity, or CARTA, and our proprietary chimeric autoantibody receptor T cells, or CAART. We believe these two strategies, which comprise our CABA platform, have the potential to be applied across a broad range of autoimmune diseases.
The initiation or maintenance of many autoimmune diseases involves B lymphocytes, also called B cells, which create a type of protein called an antibody, which bind to pathogens, such as bacteria or viruses, or to foreign substances, such as toxins, to neutralize them. Additional B cell effects include releasing cytokines, presenting antigens to T cells, and co-stimulating other immune cells to eliminate the foreign pathogens or substances. When these B cell functions become misdirected to the healthy tissues or cells in the body, they can contribute to the initiation or maintenance of an autoimmune disease. Current treatment options for these autoimmune diseases are generally limited to corticosteroids and generalized immunosuppressants that offer only temporary disease suppression, may require chronic dosing, in-hospital administration, and are associated with potentially severe side effects. Optimal therapy would either reset the immune system or selectively eliminate only the disease-causing B cells, while sparing the normal protective B cells.
Our CABA platform encompasses two strategies that seek to address both of these potentially curative approaches for patients with autoimmune diseases. The CARTA strategy is designed to achieve transient depletion of all B cells following a single treatment by using T cells engineered to express an antibody fragment that recognizes a B cell receptor expressed on the surface of all B cells, which is designed to allow for the complete elimination of B cells that contribute to disease with subsequent repopulation by healthy naïve B cells, offering the potential for durable and complete clinical responses through an immune system reset without the need for chronic immunosuppression in patients with autoimmune diseases. The CAART strategy is designed to selectively engage and eliminate only the pathogenic B cells responsible for driving disease by using T cells engineered to express disease specific targeting domains which are designed to mimic the antigen that is the subject of attack in an autoimmune disease. Our CAARs differ from chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs, in the use of the autoantigen rather than an antibody fragment, which enables the CAAR T cells to serve as a “decoy” for specific autoreactive B cell receptors expressed on the surface of B cells, causing the pathogenic B cells to engage with the CAAR T cells, mistaking them for a target antigen, and resulting in their elimination. We believe our CABA platform has potential applicability across dozens of autoimmune diseases that we have identified, evaluated and prioritized.
 Academic clinical data published in Nature Medicine in September 2022 demonstrated that a CD19-CAR T cell therapy with a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain following standard doses of lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide induced clinical remission in 5 out of 5 patients with moderate to severe, refractory systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE, with up to 17 months of follow up in the first treated patient (Mackensen, Andreas, et al. "Anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy for refractory systemic lupus erythematosus." Nature Medicine (2022): 1-9). Grade 1 cytokine release syndrome, or CRS, was observed in 3 out of 5 patients, and there was no observation of neurotoxicity of any grade. New naïve B cells repopulated within 2-5 months of CAR T infusion in all patients, with no evidence of recurrence of disease or autoantibodies following repopulation. In summary, the data suggest the potential to reset the immune system in these patients. Extending the observation of the potential of 4-1BB containing CD19-CAR T beyond SLE, in February 2023, a clinical case report was published in Lancet Rheumatology which reported that the same 4-1BB containing CD19-CAR T cell therapy was administered at the same dose following a similar preconditioning regimen with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to a patient with anti-synthetase syndrome, which is a form of myositis (Müller, Fabian, et al. “CD19-targeted CAR T cells in refractory antisynthetase syndrome.” The Lancet (2023)). This patient experienced rapid, durable and profound decreases in muscle inflammation, improvement in muscle function and reduction of autoantibody titers as early as three months after therapy and lasting for at least six months following therapy with reconstitution of the B cell population occurring within the follow-up period. Grade 1 CRS and no immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity, or ICANS, were reported.
 CABA-201 was designed for use in autoimmune patients to closely replicate the design of the academic product that has produced the clinical data reported above. The fully human CD19 binder in CABA-201, which was exclusively licensed from Nanjing IASO Biotherapeutics Co., Ltd., or IASO, was designed through screening of 100 billion antibody fragments to be a fully human equivalent of the murine FMC63 CD19 binder that was used in the Nature Medicine and Lancet Rheumatology papers referenced above. T cells expressing a 4-1BB-containing CAR with our fully human binder have been demonstrated to possess similar biologic activity in vitro and in vivo when compared to T cells expressing a 4-1BB-containing CAR utilizing the murine FMC63 CD19 binder employed in the academic studies (Dai, Zhenyu, et al. “Development and functional characterization of novel
fully human anti‐CD19 chimeric antigen receptors for T‐cell therapy.” Journal of Cellular Physiology 236.8 (2021): 5832-5847). The fully human binder has been clinically evaluated in a dual-CD19xCD22 CAR T candidate under development for B cell leukemia and lymphoma in an investigator-initiated trial in China, and IASO has reported a tolerability profile that we believe is favorable for development in autoimmune diseases. We believe CABA-201 may have the potential to transform treatment of autoimmune diseases with high unmet need through a potential immune system reset given the similarity of the overall design to the construct used in the Nature Medicine and Lancet Rheumatology studies specifically the similarities in the targeting domain as well as the use of the same 4-1BB costimulatory domain. Subject to the FDA review, we expect a potential IND clearance of CABA-201 in the first half of 2023, and initial clinical data by the first half of 2024.
In addition to a product candidate that we believe is specifically designed for use in autoimmune patients, we have established an exclusive translational research partnership with Dr. Georg Schett, who is a pioneer and global leader in the application of CD19-targeting cell therapies in autoimmunity and the senior author on the Nature Medicine and Lancet Rheumatology papers cited above. The collaboration is designed to allow Dr. Schett to share his patient samples with us in order for us to generate translational data on his patients, which will be combined with real time clinical data to generate insights and a deeper understanding of the immunologic mechanisms of response from ongoing and continued clinical studies in multiple autoimmune diseases. With the addition of CABA-201 to our cell therapy pipeline as the lead product in our CARTA strategy, informed by confidential clinical and translational insights from this scientific collaboration, we believe we can potentially address a broad range of autoimmune diseases in which B cells have a role initiating or maintaining disease.
Within the CAART strategy, our initial therapeutic focus is on mucosal pemphigus vulgaris, or mPV, a chronic, autoimmune blistering skin disease that affects the mucous membranes. mPV is caused by autoantibodies against the cell adhesion protein desmoglein 3, or DSG3. Despite a current standard of care that includes corticosteroids and adjunctive immunosuppressive agents, pemphigus vulgaris, or PV, remains associated with frequent recurrences as well as substantial morbidity and mortality. Our lead product candidate, DSG3-CAART, is being evaluated for the treatment of mPV, a subtype of PV that affects the epithelium of the mucous membranes. mPV is caused by autoantibodies against DSG3. In January 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted orphan drug designation to DSG3-CAART for the treatment of PV. In May 2020, DSG3-CAART received fast track designation from the FDA for improving healing of mucosal blisters in patients with mPV. DSG3-CAART is currently being evaluated in the Phase 1 DesCAARTesTM trial, which is currently enrolling patients. As recently presented at the 31st European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress in September 2022 and at the 29th European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ESGCT) Congress in October 2022, when administered as a monotherapy without combination therapy, we observed no dose-limiting toxicities through cohort A5, at up to a 7.5 billion DSG3-CAART cell dose. Though no clear trends in antibody levels or disease activity reduction were observed through cohort A5, one subject in cohort A4 had no disease activity by three months post-infusion while reducing steroid usage during that period, an antibody titer that dropped more than 20% by three months post-infusion, and was the only patient in the first four cohorts that had detectable DSG3-CAART persistence at the three month time point following initial DSG3-CAART infusion. Based on the data observed from these cohorts, we announced that the combination sub-study, incorporating a pre-treatment combination regimen with IVIG and cyclophosphamide, would be prioritized to follow cohort A5. We anticipate reporting one month safety and persistence data from the combination sub-study in the first half of 2023, and six month clinical data from the combination sub-study by the first half of 2024.
 Our second clinical product candidate, MuSK-CAART, is designed to treat a subset of patients with myasthenia gravis, or MG. MG is an autoimmune disease induced by autoantibodies targeting the neuromuscular junction, or NMJ, which can lead to life-threatening muscle weakness. Our product candidate targets autoreactive B cells that differentiate into antibody secreting cells that produce autoantibodies against a transmembrane protein, muscle-specific kinase, or MuSK, and is being developed for the treatment of MuSK MG. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we submitted an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for the first-in-human studies of MuSK-CAART to the FDA, which became effective in January 2022. In February 2022, MuSK-CAART received fast track designation from the FDA for improving activities of daily living and muscle strength in patients with MuSK antibody-positive myasthenia gravis. In June 2022, we received a no objection letter from Health Canada, allowing us to initiate clinical trial activities in Canada. In October 2022, MuSK-CAART received orphan drug designation for the treatment of MuSK MG. We initiated the Phase 1 MusCAARTes trial in November 2022. We anticipate reporting six month clinical data from the combination cohort by the first half of 2024.
 Our CAART pipeline also includes product candidates currently in discovery-stage or preclinical development for the treatment of mucocutaneous PV, or mcPV and PLA2R-associated membranous nephropathy, or PLA2R MN, in addition to two undisclosed targets. DSG3/1-CAART, is being developed for mcPV, which affects both mucosal and skin surfaces and is caused by autoantibodies against DSG3 and desmoglein 1, or DSG1. PLA2R-CAART is being developed to treat patients with PLA2R-assoicated membranous nephropathy, an autoimmune disease that is typically caused by production of autoantibodies directed to phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R), a single-pass transmembrane protein expressed in the glomerulus of the kidney.
 Our manufacturing strategy is comprised of three stages, designed to initially leverage the extensive early-stage manufacturing expertise of our academic partners while migrating to contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, partnerships and ultimately aiming to achieve full manufacturing independence through establishment of our own manufacturing facilities and/or through a strategic partnership. Stage 1 leverages the expertise in cell and vector manufacturing of our partners at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, or CHOP, and the University of Pennsylvania, or Penn. This stage included early development work, IND support and cell and vector product manufacturing for CABA-201 and DSG3-CAART. We believe these partnerships and use of these established facilities have allowed us to move efficiently and reliably into clinical trials, but will not be sufficient to support a commercial license. Stage 2, which is ongoing, is designed to engage partners who are positioned for manufacturing of vectors and cell processing at commercial grade and scale. In January 2021, we initiated a collaboration with WuXi Advanced Therapies, Inc. or WuXi, to serve as our cell processing manufacturing partner, and have completed enabling engineering runs in preparation for our MusCAARTesTM trial. In December 2021, we entered into a license and supply agreement with Oxford Biomedica (UK) Limited, or Oxford Biomedica, to supply lentiviral vector for the clinical and commercial development of our DSG3-CAART candidate. Contingent on sufficient clinical evidence from our product candidates, we plan to advance the third stage of our manufacturing strategy which will include leasing, building, qualifying and operating our own manufacturing facility and/or establishing a strategic partnership to rapidly and reliably scale manufacturing leveraging the partner’s manufacturing expertise. We believe this additional stage will enable full control of product development and commercial supply for products arising from our CABA platform, enabling us to achieve continuous improvement of our product candidates. Our Chief Executive Officer and our President, Science and Technology, have both, in prior roles, built and led organizations that have constructed and commissioned cell therapy facilities which we believe will enable us to build our own manufacturing organizations and facilities, if desirable.
 We plan to build upon our first mover advantage in the field of engineered T cell therapy for autoimmune diseases and further advance the discovery, development, and commercialization of our product candidate portfolio. Our preclinical, regulatory and clinical development experience have enabled the successful clearance of two cell therapy INDs for first-in-human studies in patients with autoimmune diseases within the routine review period. We have a track record of successful manufacturing and timely clinical trial execution, with robust capabilities in clinical operations and manufacturing in order to manage the complex logistics and to implement clinical trials of engineered T cell therapy in autoimmune diseases involving oncologists and medical specialists, such as dermatologists and neurologists, across a dozen sites in the United States, requiring coordination of multiple stakeholders across therapeutic areas. We believe this experience has the potential to be a significant operating advantage. Our scientific founders are leading experts in autoimmune diseases and CAR T technology, and we are led by an experienced team with demonstrated success in discovering, developing, manufacturing and evaluating novel cell therapy products in clinical trials. We have assembled a Scientific Advisory Board with relevant experience in discovery, clinical and regulatory science for autoimmunity and cell and gene therapy. In addition, we have partnered our discovery and initial development efforts with Penn, a pioneer in cell and gene therapy with a proven track record of expertise in the translational research, clinical development, and manufacturing of cell therapy products, in order to advance multiple product candidates in clinical trials along with continued progress with our preclinical product candidates.
Our History and Team
Our scientific co-founders, Aimee Payne, M.D., Ph.D., and Michael Milone, M.D., Ph.D., began partnering at Penn in 2013 to combine Dr. Payne’s expertise in B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases with Dr. Milone’s deep and experienced insights into the design and implementation of CAR T products. Dr. Payne is a worldwide leader in characterizing B cell-mediated autoantibody repertoires in PV and other autoimmune diseases. Dr. Milone is a renowned scientist in CAR T therapy and was a co-inventor of and a key driver in the preclinical discovery and development efforts that yielded Kymriah®, the first FDA-approved CAR T therapy for the treatment of B cell cancers. Dr. Payne’s laboratory surmised that by incorporating an antigen instead of an antibody fragment as the extracellular domain of the CAAR, specific pathogenic B cells could be targeted. This resulted in a collaboration between the two investigators to apply the scientific foundation of CAR T technology as it has been advanced by Drs. Payne and Milone in order to address B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.
Their first scientific publication, “Reengineering chimeric antigen receptor T cells for targeted therapy of autoimmune disease” (Science, July 2016), attracted the attention of a colleague, Steven Nichtberger, M.D., who is an adjunct professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, teaching a class on biotech company formation, financing and leadership in the Vagelos Life Sciences & Management Program. Additionally, Dr. Nichtberger has experience creating and building companies, including a novel cellular therapy company, which required transferring the technology from an academic institution, establishing a research and development organization, hiring of manufacturing and quality teams, creating novel manufacturing processes, reaching agreement with the FDA on novel clinical development pathways and constructing a commercial-scale Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, facility that manufactured autologous cell therapy products for clinical trials. In 2017, based on over a year of
interaction and discussions regarding the optimal strategy to advance the scientific opportunity into a commercially developed product portfolio that could offer potentially curative treatment options to patients, Drs. Payne, Milone and Nichtberger decided to launch Cabaletta Bio.
The longstanding and highly productive partnership between our co-founders has been complemented by additional management experience that brings a successful history of translating academic cellular therapy research from Penn and elsewhere into commercially sponsored clinical trials and the establishment of a GMP manufacturing facility and organization.
Gwendolyn Binder, Ph.D., our President, Science and Technology, was an early member of the Translational Research Program Operations team at Penn for over five years and participated in the submission and acceptance of multiple INDs for novel engineered T cell therapy products. As part of the cell therapy organization at Penn, Dr. Binder partnered with Dr. Milone and others to drive the IND-enabling translational studies that facilitated the initial CAR T clinical trial in B cell cancers at Penn. Dr. Binder also built and led a clinical stage biotechnology company’s manufacturing operations and quality teams, including creation of a fully functioning commercial grade GMP facility. Dr. Binder also built the translational research program and ultimately led the company’s research organization.
Our Chief Medical Officer, David Chang, M.D. was the late-stage clinical development leader of the only two drugs approved for SLE in the United States in over 60 years, belimumab, or Benlysta, and anifrolumab, or Sapnelo, through his roles at GlaxoSmithKline plc and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP prior to joining the team at Cabaletta Bio. Dr. Chang completed his fellowship in Rheumatology and was a faculty member in the Division of Rheumatology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania prior to his transition to the biopharmaceutical industry.
Over the past five years, Cabaletta has implemented two clinical-stage CAART cell therapy programs in autoimmunity, which have required collaborations between specialists in current therapeutic areas of interest – dermatologists and neurologists – and oncologists who are responsible for administering the cell therapy at each site. Given our track record of timely clinical trial implementation with CAART cell therapy in autoimmune diseases over the past five years at a dozen sites across the United States, we believe that our team’s successful management of the complicated planning and logistics involved with implementation of these clinical trials has the potential to be an operating advantage. The safety data from the Phase 1 DesCAARTes trial, evaluating DSG3-CAART, the lead CAART candidate, has been encouraging in patients at doses up to 7.5 billion cells. Based on emerging translational data, combination strategies to increase DSG3-CAART activity are being evaluated. The next CAART candidate, MuSK-CAART for patients with MuSK-associated myasthenia gravis, is being evaluated in the recently initiated Phase 1 MusCAARTesTM trial and has benefitted from our deep understanding of cell therapy in autoimmunity through application of our learnings to the trial design, including a higher starting cell dose delivered as a single infusion, smaller patient cohorts and earlier implementation of combination strategies. Our robust clinical execution is demonstrated through our positive regulatory interactions since 2018, with two IND applications cleared within the routine 30-day period, implementation of multiple clinical trial protocol modifications, two Fast Track Designations and two Orphan Drug Designations granted to pipeline candidates, as well as our successful manufacturing of our novel cell therapy product candidates with academic and industry partners.
As we have established our position in the field of autoimmunity, we continue to evaluate novel approaches that have the potential to cure autoimmune diseases. We were encouraged to see the results generated in an academic clinical study published in Nature Medicine in September 2022, showing the potential for CD19-CAR T to transform the course of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In five patients with SLE, one-time treatment with a 4-1BB-containing CD19-CAR T cell therapy induced deep and durable clinical responses in all five patients within three months after treatment, with favorable tolerability. Healthy B cells repopulated in all patients within five months of treatment, and responses remained durable off SLE-associated medications for up to 17 months of follow-up. These findings demonstrate the potential for CD19-CAR T to “reset the immune system,” eliminating the cause of autoimmune disease with restoration of the healthy immune system.
 Building on these results, we announced in October 2022 the development of CABA-201, a 4-1BB-containing CD19-CAR T investigational therapy, for the treatment of severe autoimmune diseases. The product has been designed to be highly similar to the construct used by Dr. Schett in the Nature Medicine paper. We are employing a fully human CD19 binder that has high similarity, including similar binding activity, to the construct employed in the academic study. Our exclusive translational research partnership with Dr. Schett, involves our robust translational research laboratory combined with confidential sharing of his unpublished clinical data to generate early and actionable insights from his trials that are informing our clinical development strategy and plans.

Accelerated by our team’s deep expertise in cell therapy, robust clinical experience in autoimmunity, and demonstrated track record of strong execution, we are uniquely positioned to advance CD19-targeting strategies to further our mission to develop therapies that deliver deep, durable and potentially curative responses for patients with autoimmune diseases.
 Our Research and Manufacturing Collaboration with Penn
Our CABA platform has already produced multiple product candidates through our sponsored research agreements, or SRAs, with Penn for the laboratories of our scientific co-founders, Drs. Payne and Milone. Our continuing relationship with our scientific co-founders provides important advice and insights to us. Our contractual relationship with Penn through ongoing licensing and research arrangements also provides important services around manufacturing supply.
In May 2020 and October 2021, we amended and restated our worldwide license agreement with Penn to develop our CAAR T technology to treat B cell-mediated autoimmune and alloimmune diseases. This license agreement provides us with access to multiple patent families covering CAAR T therapy as applied to the field of B cell-mediated autoimmune and alloimmune diseases and to the robust intellectual property portfolio created by Penn under these SRAs in this field. See “—Our Material Agreements—Amended and Restated License Agreement with Penn.”
Our ongoing collaboration with Penn is also based on a Master Translational Research Services Agreement, or the Services Agreement, that we entered into in October 2018, along with multiple additional agreements under the Services Agreement to engage and partner in individual Penn entities, including cell product manufacturing, correlative research, vector manufacturing, clinical trial operations and protocol development. In addition to the Services Agreement, we have agreements in place with various functional areas and centers that provide additional resources to Penn as well as contractual commitments from Penn with the goal of providing the capacity to manufacture certain of our product candidates. Penn has also agreed to manufacture vector product for use in our clinical trials. Penn’s obligations are subject to certain limitations and termination rights. See “—Our Material Agreements—Master Translational Research Services Agreement with Penn”.
We believe Penn is uniquely suited to be our partner in our efforts to develop product candidates leveraging our CAR T and CAAR T technology based on a decade of experience, including manufacturing and clinical support for approximately a dozen active cell therapy clinical trials. The original manufacturing process for the first FDA-approved CAR T therapy was developed at Penn before being transferred to Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation during late-stage clinical trials. We are leveraging Penn’s experience, validated standard operating procedures, manufacturing facilities and staffing to accelerate development efforts for our lead product candidate.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to build upon our expertise in engineered T cell therapies for autoimmune diseases enhanced by our exclusive translational research partnership with Dr. Georg Schett to accelerate the discovery, development and commercialization of our product candidates. We believe achieving this goal could result in potentially curative therapies for patients with unmet medical needs who suffer from a broad range of autoimmune diseases with B cell involvement. To achieve this goal, key elements of our strategy include:
•Achieving clinical proof-of-concept for our lead product candidate, CABA-201, across multiple autoimmune diseases where B cells are involved. Academic clinical data published in Nature Medicine in September 2022 demonstrated that a CD19-CAR T cell therapy with a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain following lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide induced a clinical remission in 5 out of 5 patients with moderate to severe, refractory SLE, with up to 17 months of follow up. In addition, in February 2023, a case report was published in Lancet Rheumatology which demonstrated that the same CD19-CAR T cell therapy at the same dose with a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain was administered following a similar preconditioning regimen with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to a patient with anti-synthetase syndrome, which is a form of myositis. This patient experienced profound and rapid reductions in muscle inflammation, improvement in muscle function and reduction of autoantibody titers for up to six months following therapy with reconstitution of the B cell population occurring within the follow-up period. Our exclusive translational partnership with Dr. Schett, the lead investigator of the study, is focused on generation of additional translational data to gain a deeper understanding of the immunologic mechanisms of response and clinical insights from ongoing and continued clinical studies in multiple autoimmune disease indications. Due to the high level of similarity between CABA-201 and the construct used in these studies, we believe CABA-201 may have the potential to transform the treatment of autoimmune diseases. 

•Leveraging our cellular therapy knowledge and experience in addition to development efficiencies gained through our longstanding Penn collaboration to rapidly build fully integrated internal infrastructure. We have differentiated expertise that we believe is uniquely suited to the continued buildout of our CABA platform, focused on autoimmune diseases. Our management team has expertise in conducting complex, interdisciplinary autoimmune-focused cell therapy clinical trials with a track record of positive regulatory interactions to support cell therapies in autoimmune diseases since 2018. We have had two INDs for autoimmune cell therapies cleared within the routine 30-day period with fast-track designations granted for each product candidate. In addition, we have a successful track record of manufacturing novel cell therapy product candidates with academic and industry partners. Not only does our team possesses significant experience in the manufacturing of cell therapy product candidates, but our partnership with Penn allows us to utilize their existing infrastructure, which has accelerated our early development activities. In parallel, we continue to build out our internal capabilities while developing and continuing to implement a path to manufacturing independence, with established partnerships to provide vector and cell processing capabilities at commercial grade and scale. 
 •Continuing execution of the DesCAARTes trial to achieve clinical proof-of-concept for DSG3-CAART when administered in a combination regimen or at very high doses for the CAART strategy, and leverage insights and learnings to advance additional product candidates. We believe our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating DSG3-CAART for the treatment of mPV represents an optimal first opportunity to establish initial clinical proof-of-concept for the CAART strategy in our CABA platform. We intend to continue to apply our proprietary learnings from DSG3-CAART, including scientific and regulatory strategies, to most effectively advance these additional opportunities with both the CAART and CARTA product candidates.
 •Expanding upon our established IP position and first mover advantage in CAAR T therapy targeted towards B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. We are focused on protecting our intellectual property as we continue to pursue the development of future product candidates. We believe U.S. patent 10,301,370, relating to our initial CAAR constructs, is the first patent covering cells engineered to express the known pathogenic epitopes recognized by DSG3 and DSG1 autoantibodies. We have supplemented this initial U.S. patent with additional U.S. patents relating to our DSG3- and DSG1-CAAR constructs, which cover the constructs themselves, nucleic acids encoding these constructs, and methods of treatment using the same. We are working to expand our existing patent protection with additional patent filings. The design of a broadly effective CAAR requires a deep understanding of the location of immunogenic epitopes targeted by autoantibodies, a competency that we believe we are uniquely positioned to utilize in product candidate development. We believe there is a particularly high value to the first mover advantage including, but not limited to, experience in discovery, preclinical development, regulatory efforts, intellectual property and insights from clinical trials that can be translated across programs. 
 
B Cells in Autoimmune Diseases: Overview and Current Treatment Paradigm
The body’s immune system, which is designed to protect the body from infection and cancer, includes B cells and T cells. In addition to producing antibodies against antigens that the body perceives as foreign, B cells are responsible for producing inflammatory cytokines, co-stimulating other immune cells, and presenting antigen to T cells to enable cell-mediated immunity. Autoimmune disease occurs when the immune response becomes mistakenly targeted to healthy tissues and cells, and B cells can contribute to the incitement and/or maintenance of these processes through their varied immune mechanisms. In the case of B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, B cells are responsible for driving disease through production of autoantibodies, or antibodies against the ‘self,’ that lead to disease. While these autoantibodies are the major effectors of B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, the underlying root cause of disease is the defective B cells that mistakenly differentiate into autoantibody-secreting cells. These pathogenic B cells express autoantibodies on their surface with the same antigen specificity as the circulating pathogenic autoantibodies, which can be used to distinguish them from the healthy B cell population, as shown in the figure below.

   Thomas G. Forsthuber, et al. “B cell-based therapies in CNS autoimmunity: differentiating CD19 and CD20 as therapeutic targets.” Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders (2018): Vol 11: 1-13
 
Antibodies are B cell receptors that drive B cell maturation. CD19 serves as a B cell marker from the pro B cell phase until differentiation to plasma cells, while CD20 is a surface marker expressed in a narrower range of the B cell maturation process. CABA-201 is directed to the CD19 B cell marker. CAAR T product candidates are designed to eliminate antigen specific B cells in each targeted disease, preventing their further development to antibody secreting plasma cells. IgM: immunoglobulin M; IgD: immunoglobulin D; IgA: immunoglobulin A; sIg: surface immunoglobulin, representing the autoantibody on the B cell surface.
 Current treatment options for autoimmune diseases involve generalized immune suppression, achieved through corticosteroids, immunosuppressive medications and biologics. Most commonly, corticosteroids are used on both a chronic and acute basis to control disease and act via a variety of mechanisms to control or downregulate multiple inflammatory pathways. In many cases, systemic immunosuppressive medications often used in chemotherapy such as mycophenolate, azathioprine and methotrexate, are added in an effort to minimize symptoms and manage the expected recurrences in patients. Biologic therapies have emerged as a new class of therapies and have a variety of targets including cytokines, B cells, and co-stimulation molecules. Currently existing treatment options target parts of the immune system in addition to disease-causing B cells, and in general require chronic administration to reduce recurrence rates. We believe the ideal therapy in autoimmune diseases would completely and specifically eliminate the pathogenic B cells while sparing the immune cells that protect against infection, without requiring chronic administration.

Our Approach
Our CABA platform encompasses two strategies. The CARTA (chimeric antigen receptor T cells for autoimmunity) strategy is designed to achieve transient depletion of all B cells following a single infusion, allowing for the elimination disease-causing B cells and subsequent repopulation by healthy B cells, providing potentially meaningful clinical responses to patients without long-term immunosuppression. The CAART (chimeric autoantibody T cells) strategy is designed to engineer T cells to express CAARs that selectively engage and eliminate pathogenic B cells. Our CAARs build upon the scientific foundation of CARs, differing primarily in the use of the antigen rather than an antibody fragment, which enables the CAAR T cells to serve as a “decoy” for specific autoreactive B cell receptors expressed on the surface of B cells. This allows these pathogenic B cells to engage with the CAAR T cells instead of benign antigens, resulting in their elimination. We believe our CABA platform has potential applicability across dozens of autoimmune diseases.
Our CARTA Strategy
 Engineered T cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy in which human T cells are genetically modified to express specific receptors, enabling the T cells to recognize and eliminate pathogenic cells. A key application of engineered cell therapy involves the use of CARs, which are engineered molecules that enable T cells to identify specific antigens present on the surface of diseased cells. When expressed on the patient’s T cells, the CAR directs the T cells to kill cells that express a particular antigen. CAR T technology has been used to develop treatments for B cell cancers, which have led to regulatory approvals for certain types of leukemias and lymphomas. In these B cell cancers, CAR T therapy has resulted in complete remission of disease in many patients, even in patients with severe, refractory cancer.
Academic clinical data published in Nature Medicine in September 2022 demonstrated that a CD19-CAR T cell therapy with a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain following lymphodepletion with standard doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide induced clinical remission in 5 out of 5 patients with moderate to severe, refractory SLE, with up to 17 months of follow up in the first treated patient. Grade 1 CRS was observed in 3 out of 5 patients, and there was no observation of neurotoxicity of any grade. New naïve B cells repopulated within 2-5 months of CAR T infusion in all patients, with no evidence of recurrence of disease or autoantibodies following repopulation. In summary, the data suggest the potential for a reset of the immune system in these patients.
 
Our licensed fully human CD19 binder has been designed to be highly similar to the construct used in the Nature Medicine paper. The fully human binder has been clinically evaluated in a dual-CD19xCD22 CAR T candidate under development for B cell leukemia and lymphoma in an investigator-initiated trial in China, where IASO has reported a tolerability profile that we believe is favorable for development in autoimmune diseases. The activity of T cells expressing a 4-1BB-containing CAR with our binder was evaluated against T cells expressing a 4-1BB-containing CAR utilizing the CD19 binder employed in the Nature Medicine study cited above, FMC63-CART, as a benchmark. Compared to FMC63-CART, CABA-201 exhibited comparable biologic activity in vitro and in vivo.(Dai, Zhenyu, et al). Given its similarity to the CD19-CAR T construct employed in the trial conducted by Dr.
Georg Schett and his colleagues, including incorporation of a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain, we believe the data inform the dosing of CABA-201, which may have the potential to transform treatment of autoimmune diseases with high unmet need.
 Our CAART Strategy
Our CAART strategy builds upon the scientific foundation of CARs to enable targeted B cell elimination in an autoimmune setting, which may lead to complete and durable remission of disease while sparing all other B cell populations that can provide beneficial immunity from infection. The co-stimulatory domain and the signaling domain of both a CAR T cell and CAAR T cell carry out the same activation and cytotoxic functions once the engineered cell therapy engages its relevant target expressed on a B cell. CAAR T cells differ from CAR T cells primarily in their extracellular targeting domain. Rather than containing an antibody fragment, the CAAR domain incorporates the relevant components of the autoantigen that is subject to attack in a certain autoimmune disease.
  The current standard of care for B cell-mediated autoimmune disease often provides limited and transient therapeutic benefit while also weakening the humoral immune system. We believe our CAAR T cells have the potential to eliminate the reactive, antibody-producing B cells that are ultimately responsible for disease through precise targeting of cells that contain autoantibodies on their surface, while sparing normal B cells. As a result, we believe CAAR T cell therapy used in B cell-mediated autoimmune disease has the potential for durable elimination of pathogenic B cells and an associated elimination of clinical recurrences with an improved adverse event, or tolerability, profile relative to the current standard of care. Additionally, because self-reactive B cells make up only 0.01% to 1% of the normal B cell population, we believe the risk of on-target toxicity may be reduced compared to systemically immunosuppressive medications that non-specifically weaken the immune system.
 Pipeline
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of engineered T cell therapies that have the potential to provide a deep and durable, perhaps curative, treatment for patients with autoimmune diseases. Our CABA platform encompasses two approaches – CARTA and CAART. Our current product candidate pipeline is illustrated below.



Two additional undisclosed disease targets, currently in discovery stage, and part of our pipeline portfolio through our Sponsored Research Agreement with Penn are not shown. We have discontinued work on the FVIII product candidate. This decision is due to the prioritization of other product candidates.
 

Our Product Candidates
CABA-201 for multiple autoimmune indications
 Our lead product candidate for the CARTA strategy, CABA-201, is designed to achieve transient depletion of all CD19-positive B cells following a single infusion, allowing for the elimination disease-causing B cells with subsequent repopulation by naïve healthy B cells, providing potentially meaningful clinical responses to patients without long-term immunosuppression. Through immune system reset, we believe CABA-201 has the potential to transform the treatment in a broad range of autoimmune diseases.
 CABA-201 is comprised of a fully-human anti-CD19 binder, which is the extracellular targeting domain. In addition, it contains a 4-1BB costimulatory domain and a CD3-zeta signaling domain, as shown in the figure below:
    Image showing the design of CABA-201, with a fully human anti-CD19 binder, the 4-1BB costimulatory domain and the CD3-Zeta signaling domain. The costimulatory and signaling domain are identical to the construct used in the academic clinical studies published in Nature Medicine and Lancet Rheumatology that were evaluated in SLE and myositis, respectively.
 
Academic clinical data published in Nature Medicine in September 2022 demonstrate that a CD19-CAR T cell therapy with a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain following lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide induced a clinical remission in 5 out of 5 patients with moderate to severe, refractory SLE, with up to 17 months of follow up. (Mackensen, Andreas, et al). Grade 1 CRS was observed in 3 out of 5 patients, and there was no observation of neurotoxicity of any grade. Naïve immature B cells repopulated within 2-5 months of CAR T infusion in all patients, with no evidence of recurrence of disease or autoantibodies following repopulation. In addition, in February 2023, a case report was published in Lancet Rheumatology which demonstrated that the same CD19-CAR T cell therapy with a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain at the same dose was administered following a similar preconditioning regimen with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to a patient with anti-synthetase syndrome, which is a form of myositis. This patient experienced profound decreases in muscle inflammation, improvement in muscle function and reduction of autoantibody titers six months following therapy with reconstitution of the B cell population occurring within the follow-up period. Grade 1 CRS and no ICANS were reported.
 
Our licensed fully human CD19 binder has been clinically evaluated in a dual-CD19xCD22 CAR T candidate under development for B cell leukemia and lymphoma in an investigator-initiated trial in China, where IASO has reported a tolerability profile that we believe is favorable for development in autoimmune diseases. The activity of T cells expressing a 4-1BB-containing CAR with our binder was evaluated against T cells expressing a 4-1BB containing CAR utilizing the CD19 binder employed in the Nature Medicine study cited above, FMC63-CART, as a benchmark. Compared to FMC63-CART, CABA-201 exhibits comparable biologic activity in vitro and in vivo, as shown in the figure below. (Dai, Zhenyu, et al).






In vitro (top) and in vivo (bottom) data illustrating the binding affinity and body weight effects of a CD19-CAR T with the FMC63 binder vs. the binder utilized in CABA-201 (clone 78). Binding affinities and body weight impact are most similar between the FMC63 binder and Clone 78, which is the binder in CABA-201.

Given its structural and functional similarity to the CD19-CAR T construct employed in the academic clinical study published in Nature Medicine, including incorporation of a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain, we believe CABA-201 may have the potential to reset the immune system and transform treatment of autoimmune diseases with high unmet need.
 
DSG3-CAART for Mucosal PV
Our lead product candidate for the CAART strategy, DSG3-CAART, is a CAAR T cell therapy expressing DSG3 as the extracellular domain of a chimeric immunoreceptor, and is designed to enable specific cytotoxicity toward B cells autoreactive to DSG3. We believe this strategy has the potential to directly eliminate the disease-causing cells in mPV, which may lead to lasting clinical remission without damage to the healthy immune system.
 Disease Background
PV is a potentially fatal, chronic autoimmune disease characterized by acantholysis, which is the loss of adhesion between cells of the skin or mucous membranes. Desmosomes are a collection of proteins that provide the structure for epithelial cells to connect with each other. PV results when specific pathogenic autoantibodies disrupt desmosomes by targeting DSG3 and/or DSG1, which are proteins that are part of the desmosomes. These autoantibodies cause the upper layer of the epidermis to split away from its base resulting in characteristic erosions and blisters. Widespread damage to the skin and mucous membranes increases susceptibility to life-threatening systemic infections. PV has two major subtypes: (1) mPV, which is caused by DSG3 autoantibodies and affects the mucous membranes; and (2) mcPV, which is caused by DSG3 and DSG1 autoantibodies, affecting both the mucous membranes and the skin. PV affects 11,000-19,000 prevalent patients in the United States, of which approximately 25% have mPV and 75% have mcPV.
  Like most autoimmune diseases, the current standard of care for PV relies on general immune suppression, which is often transiently effective but can lead to severe infection, potentially resulting in hospitalization and death. First-line therapy for PV typically consists of corticosteroids in moderate to high doses in combination with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab where clinically appropriate. Second-line therapy focuses on the several systemically immunosuppressive medications such as mycophenolate, azathioprine, and methotrexate. Additional options used in the acute setting include plasmapheresis, or infusions of intravenous immunoglobulin.
B cell depletion with rituximab was approved by the FDA for the treatment of PV in 2018 and is playing an increasing role as part of the standard of care because it has proven to be one of the more effective therapies for PV. Despite its recent approval for use as a therapy with corticosteroids in PV, rituximab has several limitations in terms of efficacy, safety, and convenience. Rituximab treatment frequently results in relapse, which is reduced but still occurs despite chronic treatment every six months in PV. It does not specifically target the pathogenic B cells, but rather it depletes all CD20-expressing B cells, which leads to an ongoing risk of severe infection and death. As such, there remains not only an unmet medical need in PV, but also a need for safer therapies that can provide a reliable, durable, and complete remission without long-term immunosuppression.
Preclinical & Clinical Development Plan
  A variety of in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to evaluate DSG3-CAART from a preclinical activity and toxicity perspective and to support the IND for DSG3-CAART. The FDA cleared our IND for a Phase 1 trial of DSG3-CAART in September 2019. The FDA granted DSG3-CAART orphan drug designation for the treatment of PV in January 2020 and fast track designation for improving healing of mucosal blisters in patients with mPV in May 2020. We announced that the first patient was dosed in the DesCAARTesTM trial in December 2020, and enrollment is currently ongoing.
The DesCAARTesTM trial is an open-label trial to assess the safety and tolerability of various dosing regimens of DSG3-CAART in the treatment of subjects with active mPV. We expect that the Phase 1 trial will have three parts and a combination sub-study:
•Part A: Fractionated dose escalation 
 •Combination Sub-study: Fractionated dose administered following pre-treatment with IVIG and cyclophosphamide 
 •Part B: Fractionation reduction at the selected dose 
 •Part C: Expansion phase at the selected dose and administration scheme 
 In Part A, the split dose uses dose fractionation to accommodate a low number of cells in the first infusion while still advancing the dose within the cohort up to 7.5 billion DSG3-CAART cells. In the combination sub-study, a dose of 2.5 billion DSG3-CAART cells is administered in combination with IVIG and cyclophosphamide pre-treatment. In Part B, the dose selected from Part A will be delivered in a decreased number of dose fractionations to determine the dose fractionation strategy. In Part C, subjects will be enrolled at the dose and fractionation, as determined in Part A and B, to generate additional safety and outcome data to support the rationale for and design of future clinical trials.
Patients are eligible to be enrolled if they have a confirmed diagnosis of mPV based on biopsy for histology and positive DSG3 ELISA; active disease at screening; elevated DSG3 by ELISA at screening; and previously been inadequately managed by, or refractory to, or relapsed after, or with contraindications to or intolerance of at least one prior systemic therapy. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety of DSG3-CAART cells, and secondary objectives include evaluating the initial signs of target engagement. The FDA has requested, and we have agreed, that we will share data from cohort A to inform a discussion on the optimal design of cohort C. According to FDA guidance, the submission of cohort A data is not gating to planned enrollment in cohort B and the FDA plans to provide feedback, if any, in a timely manner.
In December 2021, we reported top-line biologic activity data for the first two low dose cohorts, where no clear evidence of biologic activity was observed at doses that represented less than 2% of the current planned maximum dose in the trial, as well as the continued absence of any dose-limited toxicities, or DLTs, or clinically relevant adverse events. Furthermore, we announced the addition of a planned fifth cohort to receive a higher dose with a more consolidated dosing regimen. In May 2022, abstracts for our posters presented on May 17, 2022 at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy 25th Annual Meeting (ASGCT) were made available publicly, which summarized clinical and translational data from the first three cohorts in the DesCAARTesTM trial where we reported no DLTs, serious adverse events or clinically relevant adverse events within three months of DSG3-CAART infusion. The observed dose-dependent increase in persistence indicated that DSG3-CAART cells were not eliminated by soluble anti-DSG3 antibodies. Peak persistence in cohort A4 was at the lower end of the range observed with CAR T therapy in B cell cancers; however, the range of persistence observed with CD19-CART therapy in oncology has not been confirmed to be necessary or sufficient for clinical response in patients with mPV. In August 2022, we announced that two additional dose cohorts are planned after cohort A5: A6m (multi-dose regimen at 10 to 15 billion cells) and a combination cohort (2.5 billion cells in addition to patient pre-treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and cyclophosphamide). We also announced that the A5e cohort (enhanced manufacturing process at 5.0 to 7.5 billion cells) was no longer planned to occur immediately after cohort A5. In September 2022, we presented updated clinical and translational data through six months of follow-up in cohorts A1 through A4 as well as 28-day safety data and DSG3-CAART persistence data through day 29 for cohorts A1 through A5 from the DesCAARTesTM trial at the 31st European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress. In October 2022, we presented additional clinical and translational data on those cohorts at the 29th European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ESGCT) Congress. Additionally, we have disclosed
that no DLTs were observed through cohort A5, and that no clear trends in antibody levels or disease activity reduction were observed through cohort A5, though one subject in cohort A4 had no disease activity by three months post-infusion while reducing steroid usage during that period, an antibody titer that dropped more than 20% by three months post-infusion, and was the only patient in the first four cohorts that had detectable DSG3-CAART persistence at the three month time point following initial DSG3-CAART infusion. Based on the data observed from these cohorts, we announced that the combination sub-study would be prioritized to follow cohort A5.
DSG3/1-CAART for mcPV
Disease Background
 Our next PV product candidate, DSG3/1-CAART, is being designed to target DSG3 and/or DSG1 autoreactive B cell receptors on pathogenic B cells that cause mcPV. mcPV is the most severe and most common subtype of PV and affects approximately 75% of PV patients. While mPV is caused by DSG3 autoantibodies, mcPV involves autoantibodies to both DSG3 and DSG1, resulting in the additional involvement of skin erosion and blistering. Similar to mPV, mcPV is typically treated with immune suppression, which has a high rate of relapse and potential for hospitalizations and fatal infections.
CAAR development for mcPV, based on the targeting of DSG3- and/or DSG1-specific B cells, has shown promising preclinical results. DSG1 CAAR T cells specifically killed DSG1-specific B cells in vitro. In addition, we observed that with a 1:1 mixture of DSG3 and DSG1 CAAR T cells had killing capabilities without synergistic or antagonistic effect. The activity and toxicity of DSG3 and DSG1-CAAR T cells was evaluated using human skin xenografts in comparison with anti-CART19 cells, which are known from human clinical trials not to cause direct skin toxicity. A 1:1 mixture of DSG3 and DSG1 CAAR T cells did not show off-target toxicity in vivo.
Preclinical & Clinical Development Plan
From a regulatory and clinical trial design perspective, we anticipate that many of the elements incorporated into the DesCAARTesTM trial will carry over to DSG3/1-CAART, including trial design features as well as site selection. We believe that, because mcPV is the most prevalent subset of PV and the patients are generally followed by the same subspecialists, it will allow for a wider patient pool eligible for a clinical trial.
The size of the DSG3/1 product candidate will likely require us to incorporate additional technologies to accommodate the size of the final CAAR construct. While a product that administers a DSG3 CAAR and DSG1 CAAR as two separate products may be feasible, we believe that there would be significant advantages to developing a combined product from a regulatory and commercial perspective.
 MuSK-CAART for MuSK Myasthenia Gravis
Disease Background
 MG is an autoimmune disease induced by autoantibodies targeting the neuromuscular junction, or NMJ, which can lead to life-threatening muscle weakness. Generalized MG, or gMG, is characterized by profound muscle weakness throughout the body, which may result in motor impairment, disabling fatigue, shortness of breath due to respiratory muscle weakness and episodes of respiratory failure. gMG affects approximately 50,000 to 80,000 patients in the United States. The majority of patients who develop gMG have autoantibodies against some part of the NMJ that are known to be pathogenic. 80% to 90% of patients with gMG have autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptor, or AChR, detectable in their serum. Approximately 6% to 7.5% of patients with gMG have autoantibodies against MuSK, which is a different target on the surface of the muscle membrane.
Patients diagnosed with MuSK MG have a different recommended treatment course compared to patients with AChR MG. Importantly, many patients with MuSK MG respond poorly to cholinesterase inhibitors, which are often the first line of therapy in AChR MG. Consequently, patients with MuSK MG are typically started on corticosteroids in addition to one or more steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents. Corticosteroids are tapered to the extent possible to prevent disease relapse, though many remain dependent on corticosteroid despite concomitant treatment with immunosuppressive medications. In the acute setting, plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin may be used to address severe disease. Rituximab is often considered as a second-line therapeutic option in patients with an inadequate response to initial immunosuppressive medications. Importantly, complement is not thought to be meaningfully implicated in the pathophysiology of MuSK MG, and complement inhibitors are not indicated for treatment of disease.
Preclinical & Clinical Development Plan
Data from the in vitro and in vivo studies used to support the IND for MuSK-CAART were recently published in Nature Biotechnology, which showed preclinical data demonstrating that MuSK-CAART had similar efficacy as CD19-CAR T cells for depletion of MuSK-specific B cells and retained cytolytic activity in the presence of soluble anti-MuSK antibodies. These data contributed to the Company’s IND application for the recently initiated Phase 1 MusCAARTes clinical study of MuSK-CAART (Oh, S., Mao, X., Manfredo-Vieira, S. et al. Precision targeting of autoantigen-specific B cells in muscle-specific tyrosine kinase myasthenia gravis with chimeric autoantibody receptor T cells. Nat Biotechnol (2023)). In the fourth quarter of 2021, we submitted an IND to the FDA for MuSK-CAART, which became effective in January 2022. In February 2022, MuSK-CAART received fast track designation from the FDA for improving activities of daily living and muscle strength in patients with MuSK antibody-positive myasthenia gravis. We initiated the MusCAARTesTM trial in November 2022.
 The MusCAARTesTM trial is an open-label trial to assess the safety and tolerability of various dosing regimens of MuSK-CAART in the treatment of subjects with active MuSK MG. MuSK-CAART is administered by intravenous infusion, using a single infusion of MuSK-CAART cells at a starting dose informed by initial clinical data from the DesCAARTesTM trial and prior CAR T trials. We expect the Phase 1 trial will have two parts:
•Part A: Dose escalation
 •Part B: Expansion phase at the selected dose 
 In Part A, the dose will initially begin at 500 million MuSK-CAART cells with plans to escalate up to 7.5 billion MuSK-CAART cells in three dose cohorts. Cohort A2 is planned at 2.5 billion MuSK-CAART cells, cohort A3 is planned at 7.5 billion MuSK-CAART cells and cohort A4 is planned at 2.5 billion MuSK-CAART cells in combination with cyclophosphamide pre-treatment. Cohorts A3 and A4 will be enrolled concurrently, subject to cohort A2 being well-tolerated with a preference for enrollment into A4. We plan to enroll at least two patients per cohort and plan to dose a total of 6 subjects at the selected dose for Part A. In Part B, subjects will be enrolled at the dose determined in Part A to generate additional safety and outcome data to support the rationale for and design of future clinical trials. We plan to enroll approximately 12 subjects in Part B.
 Patients are eligible to be enrolled if they have a confirmed diagnosis of MuSK MG based on a positive anti-MuSK antibody test; myasthenia gravis severity Class I-IVa, a Myasthenia Gravis Composite Score ≥4 and a history of a negative anti-AChR antibody test. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety of MuSK-CAART cells, and a key secondary objective is to evaluate the initial signs of biologic activity. The primary endpoint of the study is the incidence of adverse events within three months of MuSK-CAART infusion, including dose limiting toxicity defined as occurring within 28 days of infusion.
 PLA2R-CAART for PLA2R MN
Disease Background
 Primary MN is an immune-mediated kidney disease caused by autoantibodies against phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R), a single-pass transmembrane protein expressed in the glomerulus of the kidney. Since the discovery of anti-PLA2R autoantibodies in 2009, evidence has shown that these autoantibodies accumulate as immune complexes in the glomeruli of the kidney and damage the filtration barrier, leading to nephrotic syndrome as characterized by proteinuria. Many patients with PLA2R-associated MN are at risk for progression to kidney failure.
 Primary MN affects approximately 15,000 patients in the United States and is associated with autoantibodies directed to PLA2R in 70-80% of patients. Immunosuppressive treatments are commonly used to treat MN, with increasing use of B cell-depleting therapies such as rituximab in the first line for medium to high-risk patients. However, high unmet need remains, as a significant fraction of patients either relapse or fail to respond following treatment with immunosuppressive therapies. By selectively depleting the PLA2R autoantibody expressing B cells that cause disease, we believe PLA2R-CAART could provide a potentially safe, effective, and durable therapeutic option for patients with PLA2R-associated MN.
Preclinical & Clinical Development Plan
As presented at the American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week in the fourth quarter of 2021, in vitro cytotoxicity and patient IgG adsorption assays have established the preliminary activity of PLA2R-CAART cells for antigen-specific B cell depletion in PLA2R MN. Multiple PLA2R-CAART cells caused specific lysis of anti-PLA2R hybridomas, and PLA2R CAARS adsorbed the majority (>95%) of anti-PLA2R IgG autoantibodies in MN sera. PLA2R-CAART cytotoxicity was preserved over time with physiologic levels of PLA2R MN plasma IgG. Though PLA2R MN IgG inhibited PLA2R-CAART cytotoxicity initially, the cytotoxicity increased with time, likely due to CAART cell proliferation and/or new CAAR synthesis.
To evaluate for preclinical signals of safety, high throughput screening for off-target PLA2R CAAR interactions was performed, and no off-target binding interactions were identified.
We anticipate that many of the learnings from our more advanced CAART programs will provide expertise in developing a clinical and regulatory strategy for PLA2R-CAART, and we plan to employ therapeutic area-specific strategies, such as the fact that PLA2R antibody levels correlate with proteinuria, a commonly used surrogate endpoint in clinical trials. We conducted a pre-IND interaction with the FDA to discuss the development path for PLA2R-CAART in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 Manufacturing
Manufacturing Strategy
We intend to implement a three-stage plan that we believe will ultimately enable us to achieve manufacturing independence. Part of our strategy relies on engaging non-profit and commercial suppliers early and in a staged manner. We believe partnering with proven and reputable manufacturing partners will allow us to efficiently deploy financial and personnel resources. Stage 1 of this plan is in place and utilizes the deep expertise in cell and vector manufacturing from our partners at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, or CHOP, and Penn. This included early development work, support of the DSG3-CAART IND, and cell and vector product manufacturing for our DesCAARTesTM trial. We believe these facilities will allow us to move efficiently into clinical trials but are not sufficient to support a commercial license.
Stage 2 of our plan is designed to engage partners who are qualified for manufacturing of vector at commercial grade and scale and cell therapy products. We are aware that changes in any manufacturing process or facility introduces regulatory and scientific risk to a development program, if the changes result in a product that is not comparable. We plan to mitigate these risks primarily in two ways:
•By securing contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, as partners during Stage 2 of our manufacturing strategy early on for both vector and cell manufacturing. We plan to prioritize potential partners who are qualified to, and have an established track record of, the commercial production of vector and cell products. We believe this allows us to make one change in our supply partners during an early period of clinical development to facilitate in vitro comparability testing and clinical validation, prior to controlled clinical studies. As part of this strategy, in January 2021, we initiated a collaboration with WuXi to serve as our cell processing manufacturing partner for our MusCAARTesTM trial. Engineering runs confirming successful technology transfer of our manufacturing process have been completed in preparation for the MusCAARTesTM trial. In December 2021, we entered into a license and supply agreement with Oxford Biomedica to supply lentiviral vector for the clinical and commercial development of our DSG3-CAART candidate.
 •By licensing the cell manufacturing process used for our Phase 1 DSG3-CAART first-in-human study from Penn. This is allowing us the time to understand the process used in order to reduce the chance of changes that may impact comparability. 
 In addition to Stage 2, and contingent on sufficient clinical evidence from our planned clinical trials, we are further planning to pursue Stage 3 in manufacturing supply. During Stage 3, we plan to lease, build, qualify and run our own manufacturing facility, or establish a strategic partnership to leverage the partner’s manufacturing expertise. We believe this additional stage will enable full control of continuous improvement, product development and commercial supply for products arising from our CABA platform.
Vector Manufacturing
The lentiviral vector that we have used in the initial subjects in our DesCAARTesTM trial was manufactured at CHOP. The lentiviral vector that we plan to use in the initial subjects in our MusCAARTesTM trial, and for CABA-201, was manufactured at Penn. We have reserved additional vector manufacturing slots at Penn and CHOP, which we may use in our subsequent clinical trials. In parallel, we have engaged in development work with multiple CMOs to secure production slots for vector which may be used in our DSG3-CAART or subsequent clinical trials. In December 2021, we entered into a license and supply agreement with Oxford Biomedica to supply lentiviral vector for the clinical and commercial development of our DSG3-CAART candidate. We believe these efforts will provide us with sufficient clinical-grade vector to move forward with our anticipated clinical trials.
Cell Manufacturing
We have entered into a collaboration with the Clinical Cell and Vaccine Production Facility, or CVPF, at Penn, to provide focused scientific, technical and regulatory support for CAAR T and CAR T cell manufacture. CVPF is accredited by the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy and is capable of and experienced at supporting manufacture for early-phase clinical trials of novel cell therapy products in first-in-man clinical trials. We expect to rely upon CVPF to provide initial Phase 1 clinical trial drug supply for CABA-201 and DSG3-CAART. Penn’s manufacturing process for DSG3-CAART is directly related to the process developed at Penn for early clinical trials of CART19, which subsequently became known commercially as Kymriah. The process was later transferred to Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation and further modified for the Kymriah program.
As we scale our manufacturing of DSG3-CAART and our other product candidates to meet our expected needs for further clinical trials, we may or may not rely on Penn, but we also expect to rely on CMOs and other third parties for the manufacturing and processing of our clinical trial materials. Any CMO that we select will be subject to cGMP requirements. We believe the use of contract manufacturing for our pipeline programs will be cost-effective and allow us to rapidly prepare for clinical trials in accordance with our development plans. In preparation for this transition, we have engaged multiple third-party contractors to manufacture clinical grade viral vector used to deliver the applicable CAAR or CAR gene into the T cells. We have also initiated development work with certain contractors for cGMP and commercial vector production. We expect third-party manufacturers will be capable of providing and processing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated clinical trial demands and commercial need. In January 2021, we initiated a collaboration with WuXi to serve as our cell processing manufacturing partner for our ongoing MusCAARTesTM trial, which collaboration was amended in August 2022.
Commercialization
Our aim is to become a fully integrated cellular therapy company focused on improving the lives of patients with autoimmune diseases. The product candidates from our CABA platform are designed to address autoimmune indications where there is a compelling opportunity to improve clinical outcomes in comparison with the current standard of care.
Our lead CARTA product candidate, CABA-201, is under development for autoimmune diseases with serious unmet medical need. Based on the differentiated expertise of Cabaletta’s team members and our years of experience in conducting cell therapy clinical trials in autoimmunity, we are focused on being the first company to launch a cell therapy product for patients with autoimmune diseases, while continuing to innovate on next-generation approaches and differentiation strategies to deliver an optimal product candidate profile. Our CAART product candidates are focused on rare disease populations where we believe there is potential to commercialize independently due to the concentration of treatment paradigms and limited but easily identified patient populations.
We aim to achieve full manufacturing independence through establishment of our own manufacturing facilities and/or through a strategic partnership. Our development and commercialization efforts will focus initially on the United States, with expansion to the European Union and Asia-Pacific geographies, potentially with the support of strategic partners.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong focus on intellectual property. We face competition from many different players, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research organizations and governmental agencies. Any therapeutic candidates we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with the existing standard of care as well as any novel therapies that may gain regulatory approval in the future.
There are multiple companies with marketed CAR T therapies for the treatment of hematologic cancers, including Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Bristol Myers Squibb, Johnson and Johnson, Inc. and Legend Biotech Corporation. A subset of these companies along with other biopharmaceutical companies have announced CD19-targeting therapies in development for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. There are also a number of companies with leading autoimmune franchises but without disclosed cell therapy platforms who may become competitors.
 Existing treatment options for PV are limited. Rituximab, marketed by Roche Holding AG, is the first drug to have received approval for PV in the United States in over 60 years. In Europe, the approved therapies for PV are corticosteroids, azathioprine, and rituximab. Other standard of care treatments include various immunosuppressants, plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulin infusions given monthly or on another periodic chronic basis. Additionally, multiple biopharmaceutical companies have therapies in clinical development. Competition in the MuSK MG autoimmune space is currently dominated by the current
standard of care, rituximab. A second approved approach to treating patients is IVIG, which is available through CSL Behring LLC, Grifols, S.A., and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation. Additionally, multiple biopharmaceutical companies have therapies in clinical development. We believe we are the first and only company developing CAAR T drug candidates for the treatment of B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.
Within the CAR T field we recognize that a subset of companies with an investment and expertise in CAR T cell development for oncology indications have announced they intend to leverage their technology in autoimmune disease-affected populations. We are aware of other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are exploring CART-19 as well as other methods of engineering T cells, natural killer (NK) cells or bispecific antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune conditions.
Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Intellectual Property and Barriers to Entry
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including pursuing and maintaining patent protection intended to cover our product candidates and their use, as well as other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on know-how, confidentiality agreements, invention assignment agreements and trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, to develop and maintain our proprietary position. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and the invention assignment agreements are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed for us by our employees, consultants or certain other third parties. We seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in our agreements and security measures, either may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently discovered by competitors.
Our commercial success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technologies, inventions and trade secrets related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, particularly our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others.
The patent positions for biotechnology companies like us are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
As of March 1, 2023, our patent estate (all of which has been in-licensed) included five issued U.S. patents, two granted foreign patents, seven pending U.S. patent applications, and 50 pending foreign patent applications. See “—Our Material Agreements—IASO Agreement” and “—Our Material Agreements—Amended and Restated License Agreement with the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.”
With regard to our CABA-201 product candidate, we have one pending U.S. patent application and counterpart patent applications pending in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong and Japan, which are directed to a CD19 specific chimeric antigen receptor and a CD19-specific antibody binding site. These patent applications, if issued, would be expected to expire in 2040. This patent family is owned by IASO and is exclusively licensed to us in the field of the license.
 With regard to our DSG3-CAART and DSG3/1-CAART product candidates, we have five issued U.S. patents with claims directed to a CAAR containing an extracellular domain containing DSG3, DSG1 or fragments thereof, nucleic acids encoding the CAAR, genetically modified cells comprising the CAAR, and methods of treatment using the same. These patents are scheduled to
expire between 2035 and 2037, without taking potential patent term extensions into account. We also have one pending U.S. patent application and counterpart patents granted in Europe and China, which are scheduled to expire in 2035, and patent applications pending in Canada, China, Europe and Hong Kong. This patent family is owned by Penn and exclusively licensed to us in the field of the license.
With regard to our MuSK-CAAR T cell product candidate, we have one pending U.S. patent application and counterpart patent applications pending in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico and New Zealand, which if issued, would be expected to expire in 2039. We have one pending international patent application filed under the patent cooperation treaty. Any patents claiming priority to the international patent application would be expected to expire in 2042. These patent families are owned by Penn and exclusively licensed to us in the field of the license.
With regard to our PLA2R-CAAR T cell product candidate, we have two pending U.S. patent applications and counterpart patent applications pending in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, and Russia, which if issued, would be expected to expire in 2039. This patent family is owned by Penn and exclusively licensed to us in the field of the license.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application.
In the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended, and a given patent may only be extended once. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. It is possible that issued U.S. patents covering each of our product candidates may be entitled to patent term extensions. If our product candidates receive FDA approval, we intend to apply for patent term extensions, if available, to extend the term of patents that cover the approved product candidates. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
In addition to patent protection, we also rely on know-how and trade secret protection for our proprietary information that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, to develop and maintain our proprietary position. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, including restricting access to our premises and our confidential information, as well as entering into agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and potential collaborators, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our know-how, trade secrets, and other proprietary information.
In addition, we plan to rely on regulatory protection based on orphan drug exclusivities, data exclusivities, and market exclusivities. See “—Government Regulation” for additional information.

Our Material Agreements
IASO Agreement
 
On October 7, 2022, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the IASO Agreement) with IASO. Pursuant to the IASO Agreement, we received an exclusive, worldwide license under certain IASO intellectual property to use a novel clinical-stage anti-CD19 binder to develop, manufacture, commercialize and otherwise exploit T cell products directed to CD19 for the purpose of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of any autoimmune or alloimmune indications in humans. IASO has the right of first negotiation if we desire to grant a third party an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, commercialize or otherwise exploit the licensed products in the Greater China region. Pursuant to the IASO Agreement, we and IASO have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to refrain from engaging in certain competitive activities with respect to certain programs. As partial consideration for the exclusive license, IASO received an upfront payment of $2.5 million. IASO is also eligible to receive up to mid double digit millions in milestone payments based upon the achievement of specified pre-clinical, development and regulatory milestones, and up to an additional low triple digit millions in milestone payments based upon achievement of specified sales milestones, for a total consideration, inclusive of the upfront payment, of up to $162 million, along with tiered mid-single digit royalties on future net sales for licensed products that may result from the IASO Agreement. We also may sublicense through multiple tiers the rights granted to it by IASO under the IASO Agreement at any time, however, we must pay IASO a low double-digit percentage of any revenue obtained from sublicenses or options to third parties, subject to certain customary exclusions. The IASO Agreement will continue on a country-by-country, licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the expiration of the royalty term as identified in the IASO Agreement, unless earlier terminated. We and IASO may terminate the IASO Agreement for a material, uncured breach or insolvency of the other party. We may also terminate the IASO Agreement at will upon advance written notice and in the event IASO rejects the IASO Agreement due to bankruptcy-related matters. IASO may also terminate the IASO Agreement if we fail to achieve certain specified diligence milestones in a timely manner and/or if we commence any patent challenges with respect to the patents and patent applications relating to the licensed sequence, in each case upon advance written notice.
 Amended and Restated License Agreement with the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia
In July 2019, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement, or the License Agreement, as further amended in May 2020 and October 2021, with Penn and CHOP, collectively the Institutions, pursuant to which we obtained (a) a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, worldwide research license to make, have made and use products in two subfields of use, (b) effective as of October 2018, an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, under certain patent rights of the Institution to make, use, sell, offer for sale and import products in the same two subfields of use, and (c) effective as of October 2018, a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with limited rights to sublicense, under certain of Penn’s know-how, which know-how satisfies certain criteria and is listed on a mutually agreed-to schedule, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and have imported products in the same two subfields of use. Our rights are subject to the rights of the U.S. government and certain rights retained by the Institutions. The License Agreement was amended in May 2020 to add certain intellectual property relating to one of the two undisclosed disease targets and in October 2021 to extend certain dates by which we must achieve certain financial and regulatory milestones.
 Unless earlier terminated, the License Agreement expires on the expiration or abandonment or other termination of the last valid claim in the intellectual property we license from Penn. We may terminate the License Agreement at any time for convenience upon 60 days written notice. In the event of an uncured, material breach, Penn may terminate the License Agreement upon 60 days written notice.
 Penn maintains control of all filing, prosecution and maintenance of the Institutions’ patent rights licensed by us, and we are responsible for all ongoing patent costs during the term of the agreement. We also reimbursed Penn for its out-of-pocket expenses incurred prior to the effective date of the agreement with respect to the filing, prosecution and maintenance of the patent rights licensed by us. Under the terms of the License Agreement, we were also obligated to pay $2.0 million annually for three years beginning August 2018 for funding to the laboratories of each of Drs. Milone and Payne. See “—Sponsored Research Agreements with the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania.”
Under the License Agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a product in each subfield. During the term of the License Agreement until the first commercial sale of the first product, we are obligated to pay Penn a non-refundable, non-creditable annual license maintenance fee of $10,000. We are required to pay certain milestone payments upon the achievement of specified clinical and commercial milestones. Milestone payments are reduced by a certain percentage for
the second product that achieves a milestone, by an additional percentage for the third product that achieves a milestone, and so on, for each subsequent product that achieves a milestone. In the event that we are able to successfully develop and launch multiple products under the License Agreement, total milestone payments could be approximately $21.0 million. Penn is also eligible to receive tiered royalties at percentage rates in the low single-digits, subject to an annual minimum royalty, on annual worldwide net sales of any products that are commercialized by us, our affiliates or our sublicensees that contain, use, embody, result from the use of or incorporate, or are covered by, the intellectual property licensed by us. To the extent we sublicense our license rights under the License Agreement, Penn would be eligible to receive tiered sublicense income at percentage rates in the mid-single to low double-digits. We have also entered into a subscription and technology transfer agreement with Penn, pursuant to which we owed Penn an upfront subscription fee, which was paid in 2019, and a nominal non-refundable royalty on the net sales of products, a portion of which will be credited toward milestone payments and royalties under this License Agreement. Technology transfer activities would be at our cost and subject to agreement as to the technology to be transferred.
Sponsored Research Agreements with Penn
Dr. Michael Milone
In April 2018, we entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement with Penn for the laboratory of Dr. Milone, or the Milone SRA, pursuant to which we agreed to sponsor certain research related to the development of (i) T cell based immunotherapies for autoimmune and alloimmune antibodies of pathologic significance and (ii) a clinical grade microfluidic device designed for single step selection and activation of T cells from blood samples to be conducted in Dr. Milone’s laboratory at Penn. Under the Milone SRA, Penn granted us a perpetual, irrevocable, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use all intellectual property resulting from the research sponsored by us for internal research purposes. In addition, Penn granted us an option to include, in exchange for a fee, any intellectual property resulting from the research sponsored by us that relates to CAAR T cell therapies for hemophilia and/or pemphigus within the scope of the License Agreement. Penn also granted us an option to negotiate a license to all other intellectual property resulting from the research sponsored by us. In April 2021 and October 2021, the Milone SRA was amended to extend the term of the original research plan. The Milone SRA expired in November 2022.
Dr. Aimee Payne
In April 2018, we entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement, or SRA, with Penn for the laboratory of Dr. Payne, or the Payne SRA, pursuant to which we agreed to sponsor certain research related to the development of T cell based immunotherapies for autoimmune and alloimmune antibodies of pathologic significance to be conducted in Dr. Payne’s laboratory at Penn. In May 2020, the Payne SRA was amended to include CAAR design and optimization efforts in three additional B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. In August 2020, this agreement was further amended to extend the term of the original research plan. In December 2021, we further amended the Payne SRA to extend the term and expand the workplan to include additional correlative studies related to the DesCAARTesTM trial. Unless earlier terminated, the Payne SRA will expire in December 2024. In December 2022, we signed a budget amendment for the Payne SRA. Under the Payne SRA, Penn granted us a perpetual, irrevocable, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use all intellectual property resulting from the research sponsored by us for internal research purposes. In addition, Penn granted us an option to include, in exchange for a fee, any intellectual property resulting from the research sponsored by us that relates to CAAR T cell therapies for hemophilia, MG and/or pemphigus within the scope of the License Agreement. Penn also granted us an option to negotiate a license to all other intellectual property resulting from the research sponsored by us.
 The total cost of the two SRAs was $12.6 million, which satisfies the $2.0 million annual obligation under the License Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the activities under the Payne and Milone SRAs have been completed and the full cost has been incurred.
 Master Translational Research Services Agreement with Penn
In October 2018, we entered into a Master Translational Research Services Agreement with Penn, or the Services Agreement, pursuant to which Penn agreed to perform certain services related to the research and development of the technology licensed to us under the License Agreement, as well as certain clinical, regulatory and manufacturing services. The Services Agreement will expire on the later of (i) October 19, 2021 or (ii) completion of the services for which we have engaged Penn under the Services Agreement. Either party may terminate this agreement with or without cause upon a certain number of days’ prior written notice. The services encompassed by the Services Agreement are performed by different organizations at Penn pursuant to certain addenda to the Services Agreement, including the Center for Advanced Retinal and Ocular Therapeutics, or CAROT, Addendum, as amended in May 2020, and the CVPF Addendum. In addition, in July 2019 we entered into an Alliance Agreement with Penn, pursuant to which we will pay Penn a nominal annual fee in order for Penn to provide an adequate and consistent level of support to the services that it provides to us.
The CAROT Addendum
Under the CAROT Addendum, Penn manufactures vector that is then to be used by the CVPF in the manufacture of our product candidates. In the event that certain materials owned by Penn are incorporated into a product developed for us, Penn has agreed to grant us a limited license to use those materials. Further, Penn agreed to grant us an exclusive, paid-up, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable, perpetual exclusive license to any deliverables produced under the CAROT Addendum, except with respect to certain technical information of Penn that is contained or incorporated in the deliverables, to which Penn agreed to grant us a limited nonexclusive license. However, any necessary technology transfer would be pursuant to the subscription and technology transfer agreement described above.
The CVPF Addendum
Under the CVPF Addendum, Penn conducts process validation studies and large-scale engineering runs for our product candidates. Under the CVPF Addendum, CVPF will contractually agree to manufacture agreed upon quantities of DSG3-CAART material for use in connection with our DesCAARTesTM trial, unless the agreement is terminated by either party. Any necessary technology transfer would be pursuant to the subscription and technology transfer agreement described above.
Oxford Biomedica
 In December 2021, we entered into a Licence and Supply agreement, or LSA, with Oxford Biomedica (UK) Limited wherein the LSA grants us a non-exclusive license to Oxford’s LentiVector® platform for its application in our DSG3-CAART program and puts in place a multi-year vector supply agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, we were required to pay Oxford an upfront fee, as well as costs associated with initial vector manufacturing activities for a total cost of up to approximately $4.0 million. Oxford is eligible to receive regulatory and sales milestones in the low tens of millions and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products that incorporate the Oxford technology. We can terminate the agreement at will upon advance written notice and subject to certain manufacturing slot cancellation fees.
Wuxi Agreement
 In January 2021, we entered into an agreement with WuXi, or the Wuxi Agreement, to serve as our cell processing manufacturing partner for the MuSK-CAART Phase 1 clinical trial, or MusCAARTes TM trial. The WuXi Agreement will expire the later of January 2024, or upon completion of WuXi’s services related to the MusCAARTesTM trial. We have the right to terminate the WuXi Agreement for convenience or other reasons specified in the WuXi Agreement upon prior written notice. If we terminate the WuXi Agreement, we will be obligated to pay an early termination fee of up to $1,500.
Government Regulation
U.S. Regulation
As a biopharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation. Our cell products will be regulated as biologics. With this classification, commercial production of our products will need to occur in registered facilities in compliance with cGMP for biologics. The FDA categorizes human cell- or tissue-based products as either minimally manipulated or more than minimally manipulated, and has determined that more than minimally manipulated products require clinical trials to demonstrate product safety and efficacy and the submission of a BLA for marketing authorization. Our products are considered more than minimally manipulated and will require evaluation in clinical trials and the submission and approval of a BLA before we can market them.
Government authorities in the United States (at the federal, state and local level) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process for
obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Biological Product Development
In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may result in delays to the conduct of a study, regulatory review and approval or subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license suspension or revocation, refusal to allow an applicant to proceed with clinical trials, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of untitled or warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations or penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our drug product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the Biologics License Application, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as preclinical, laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and standards; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practices, or GCPs, and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product candidate for its proposed indication; 
 •submission to the FDA of a BLA, which includes not only the results of the clinical trials, but also, detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture and quality controls for the product candidate and proposed labeling; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, purity and potency; 
 •potential FDA audit of the preclinical trial sites and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States. 
 The data required to support a BLA is generated in two distinct development stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical development stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the preclinical studies must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, as well as other information, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns, non-compliance, or other issues affecting the integrity of the trial. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA before initiation of a clinical trial in the United States, certain human clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules are subject to oversight of institutional biosafety committees,
or IBCs, as set forth in the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Under the NIH Guidelines, recombinant and synthetic nucleic acids are defined as: (i) molecules that are constructed by joining nucleic acid molecules and that can replicate in a living cell (i.e., recombinant nucleic acids); (ii) nucleic acid molecules that are chemically or by other means synthesized or amplified, including those that are chemically or otherwise modified but can base pair with naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules (i.e., synthetic nucleic acids); or (iii) molecules that result from the replication of those described in (i) or (ii). Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug product candidate to healthy volunteers and patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap. Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the drug product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action tolerability, adverse effects, and safety of the drug product candidate and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy. Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites, in multiple countries, and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of the product for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA. In certain instances, FDA may condition approval of a BLA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval. Such post-approval trials are sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and further document clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under Accelerated Approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the biologic, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated intervals based on access to certain data from the trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that
there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as interim data suggesting a lack of efficacy. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
BLA and FDA Review Process
Following trial completion, trial data are analyzed to assess safety and efficacy. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, along with proposed labeling for the product and information about the manufacturing process and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality, results of analytical testing conducted on the chemistry of the drug product candidate, and other relevant information. The BLA is a request for approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety, purity, potency and efficacy, which is demonstrated by extensive preclinical and clinical testing. The application may include both negative or ambiguous results of preclinical and clinical trials as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee, which is adjusted on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business.
Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, sixty days after the BLA’s submission, the FDA’s goal is to review BLAs within 10 months of the filing date for standard review or six months of the filing date for priority review, if the application is for a product intended for a serious or life-threatening condition and the product, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that the data is insufficient for approval, and may require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies before it accepts the filing. Additionally, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
After the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed drug product candidate is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the drug product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the drug product candidate’s identity, strength, quality, purity and potency. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug product candidates or drug product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of a BLA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving a BLA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related
to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application or request a hearing. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a product for marketing in the United States, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific populations, severities of allergies, and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the BLA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. Additionally, post-approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, changing manufacturing processes and adding labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. Such post-approval requirements can be costly and time-consuming and can affect the potential market and profitability of the product.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity on the basis of greater effectiveness or safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If we pursue marketing approval for an indication broader than the orphan drug designation we have received, we may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a fast track product concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if the product qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. Under the fast track designation, the FDA may consider for
review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review, or review within a six-month timeframe from the date a complete BLA is accepted for filing, if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. An investigational drug may obtain accelerated approval if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials and, under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Breakthrough Designation
A product can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a drug product candidate be designated as a breakthrough therapy concurrently with, or at any time after, the submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if the drug product candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. If so designated, the FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product’s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product’s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather preclinical and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor, and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable.
Accelerated Approval for Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapies
FDA’s regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative medicine advanced therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A drug sponsor may request that FDA designate a drug as an RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A BLA for an RMAT may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through (1) surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit or (2) reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of such designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. An RMAT that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval.
Pediatric Trials
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDCA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
Post-Marketing Requirements
Following approval of a new product, a manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling, distribution, and tracking and tracing requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs and biologics for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use.
In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. BLA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
The FDA also may require post-approval testing, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, REMS and post-marketing surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
Other Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS (e.g., the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, and Office for Civil Rights), the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. In the United States, sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with federal and state fraud and abuse laws, data privacy and security laws, transparency laws, and pricing and reimbursement requirements in connection with governmental payor programs, among others. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or efficacy of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, which was part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA. This amendment to the PHSA attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times, that the product and the reference product may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products as compared to small molecule drugs, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
A reference biological product is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after first licensure. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. This does not include a supplement for the biological product or a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device, or strength, unless that change is a modification to the structure of the biological product and such modification changes its safety, purity, or potency. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which attaches to the twelve-year exclusivity period for reference biologics, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
Pricing and Reimbursement
United States
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products, once approved, will be covered and reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product, including a biologic, typically is separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that a payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any drug product candidate that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the drug product candidate, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Whether or not we conduct such studies, our drug product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new drug products are typically made by CMS, an agency within HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new drug product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors and coverage and reimbursement levels for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Additionally, one third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product or service, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process will often require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs, including biologics, have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. In many countries, the prices of drug products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of drug products under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for drug products may be reduced compared with the United States. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drug product candidate or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drug product candidate could reduce physician usage of the drug product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been approved. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations in the United States and our current and future arrangements with clinical investigators, healthcare providers, consultants, third-party payors and patients may expose us to broadly applicable federal and state fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, and HIPAA.
 The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution.
 Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, drug manufacturers can be held liable under the federal civil False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off- label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. The federal False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the federal False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, if approved, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law.
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
Additionally, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and states in which we conduct our business. For example, HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which include certain health care providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information and other personal data in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent or otherwise different than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties.
Further, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other licensed health care practitioners and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts.

We may become subject to federal government price reporting laws, which would require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs, as well as federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
 Similar federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services. Such laws are generally broad and are enforced by various state agencies and private actions. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, and require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, individual imprisonment, exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource- consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.
Current and Future Legislation
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.
For example, in 2010, the ACA was enacted in the United States. The ACA includes measures that have significantly changed, and are expected to continue to significantly change, the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are that the ACA:
•made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on average manufacturer price, or AMP, on most branded prescription drugs and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP; 
 •imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs to provide a 70% point-of-sale discount as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs being covered under Medicare Part D; 
 •extended a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; 
 •expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program; 
 •imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, and 
 •established a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products. The ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted:
 •The Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequence legislation, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress that include aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which remain in effect through 2031. Due to the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, estimated budget deficit increases resulting from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, and subsequent legislation, Medicare payments to providers will be further reduced starting in 2025 absent further legislation.
 •The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely affect our future profitability. 
 •On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to request access to certain IND products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
 
•On April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
 •On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
 In addition, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. President Biden has issued multiple executive orders that have sought to reduce prescription drug costs. In February 2023, HHS issued a proposal in response to an October 2022 executive order from President Biden that includes a proposed prescription drug pricing model that will test whether targeted Medicare payment adjustments will sufficiently incentivize manufacturers to complete confirmatory trials for drugs approved through FDA’s accelerated approval pathway. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA includes several provisions that may impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that reduce the out-of-pocket spending cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries from $7,050 to $2,000 starting in 2025, thereby effectively eliminating the coverage gap; impose new manufacturer financial liability on certain drugs under Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D price caps for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition; require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for certain drug prices that increase faster than inflation; and delay until January 1, 2032 the implementation of the HSS rebate rule that would have limited the fees that pharmacy benefit managers can charge. Further, under the IRA, orphan drugs are exempted from the Medicare drug price negotiation program, but only if they have one rare disease designation and for which the only approved indication is for that disease or condition. If a product receives multiple rare disease designations or has multiple approved indications, it may not qualify for the orphan drug exemption. The effects of the IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.
 Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain drug access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we may be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions that we may in the future select governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we would need to obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit an MAA. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
European Union General Data Protection Regulation
In addition to EU regulations related to the approval and commercialization of our products, we may be subject to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data of persons in the EU, including, for example, more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to special categories of data, such as health data, and additional obligations when we contract with third-party processors in
connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States and other third countries. In addition, the GDPR provides that EU member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of personal data, including genetic, biometric or health data.
The GDPR applies extraterritorially, and we may be subject to the GDPR because of our data processing activities that involve the personal data of individuals located in the European Union, such as in connection with our EU clinical trials. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to €20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to the personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new data protection rules.
Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 60 employees, 58 of whom were full-time and two who were part-time. Of those, 51 were engaged in research and development activities. All company employees are located in the United States. We do not have any employees that are represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our future success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel, maintain our culture, and ensure diversity and inclusion in our board, management and broader workforce. Our human resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards. As these areas directly impact our ability to compete and innovate, they are key focus areas for our board of directors and senior executives. A testament to our strong culture is the strong results from our annual employee survey.
