Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company, discovering and developing novel small molecule therapeutics to treat unmet needs in autoimmunity and cancer. Our lead product candidate, KZR-616, a first-in-class selective immunoproteasome inhibitor, has completed testing in healthy volunteers and is now enrolling a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in lupus and lupus nephritis. We believe that the immunoproteasome is a validated target for the treatment of a wide variety of autoimmune diseases, given the compelling published activity seen with proteasome inhibitors administered to patients with severe autoimmune diseases. Our Phase 1a clinical trial results provide evidence that KZR-616 avoids the side effects caused by non-selective proteasome inhibitors, side effects that prevent them from being developed as a treatment in autoimmunity. Initial top-line results from the Phase 1b portion of our trial are expected in the second quarter of 2019, and we plan to initiate the Phase 2 portion of the trial in the second quarter of 2019 as well. In January 2019, we began enrolling healthy female patients in a Phase 1 trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and target inhibition of a simplified lyophilized formulation of KZR-616. We are also leveraging our protein secretion pathway research platform to discover and develop small molecule therapies targeting oncology indications and remain on-track to nominating the first clinical candidate in 2019.
 We acquired exclusive worldwide rights to KZR-616 and an accompanying library of similar molecules pursuant to a license agreement with Onyx Therapeutics, Inc., or Onyx, a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen, Inc., or Amgen, in June 2015. Patent coverage for KZR-616 extends to at least 2034. We intend to develop KZR-616 to address underserved autoimmune diseases, including lupus nephritis (LN), dermatomyositis (DM), and polymyositis (PM), where we have planned initial Phase 2 clinical trials, as well as other autoimmune indications. Our first Phase 2 clinical trial is intended to evaluate KZR-616 for the treatment of LN, which currently has no FDA or EMA-approved drugs.

Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is to focus on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel small molecule therapeutics to address unmet medical needs. Key elements of our strategy are to: 

▪ | Rapidly advance KZR-616 in multiple autoimmune indications, including orphan diseases and other areas of unmet needs. We believe that KZR-616 has the potential to treat a wide range of autoimmune diseases. We are currently enrolling a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in patients with lupus and lupus nephritis and plan to initiate trials in up to four additional autoimmune indications in 2019. Assuming positive results from these trials, we intend to explore registration-enabling trials in each indication. We believe we could be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation, Fast Track designation or orphan drug designation, which, if granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, may accelerate clinical development and regulatory review.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Identify small molecule disruptors of the protein secretion pathway and advance them into IND-enabling studies. We believe we are the only company exploring the therapeutic potential of modulating the protein secretion pathway and the Sec61 translocon. We intend to leverage this platform to identify product candidates for the treatment of diseases with significant clinical need, initially in oncology and immuno-oncology.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Develop next-generation immunoproteasome inhibitors. Over time, we intend to develop new chemistries with differentiated properties, alternate drug delivery methods, such as oral versus subcutaneous, or improved therapeutic windows.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Leverage our technical and business expertise to expand our pipeline of small-molecule product candidates. Our management team, board of directors and clinical and scientific advisors have many years of institutional experience. As such, we intend to leverage the collective talent within our organization and network of advisors to guide our development plans and pipeline expansion, including acquiring or in-licensing small molecule compounds.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Maximize the value of our programs by maintaining flexibility to commercialize our product candidates independently or through collaborative partnerships. We currently have exclusive global development and commercialization rights for our product candidates for all indications that we may pursue. While we may develop these products independently, we may also enter into strategic relationships with biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies to advance our product candidates.

 Unmet Needs in Autoimmunity and the Opportunity for KZR-616 
 Approximately 50 million people in the United States suffer from more than 100 diagnosed autoimmune diseases according to the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association, Inc. Large indications such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis are well known, each afflicting millions of people, while many others are rare or orphan indications with prevalence rates in the United States of under 200,000. Across this spectrum, in indications large and small, there remain significant unmet medical needs and indications with no approved drugs beyond broadly prescribed steroids and similar immunosuppressive regimens. 
 Prevalence estimates of systemic lupus erythematosus, also known as lupus or SLE, and lupus nephritis in the United States vary, but recent industry estimates suggest over 460,000 and 100,000 patients, respectively. The presence of nephritis dramatically increases mortality risk in lupus patients, and there are currently no FDA-approved therapies for lupus nephritis. Among our other lead indications, dermatomyositis and polymyositis are serious disorders involving muscle inflammation and weakness with no FDA-approved therapies. According to the Myositis Association, an estimated 70,000 people in the United States have these disorders. 
 We closely track the multiple autoimmune diseases where Velcade® (bortezomib), a nonselective proteasome inhibitor, has demonstrated positive clinical activity, including lupus, lupus nephritis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, primary Sjögren’s syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and graft-versus-host disease. Although no randomized clinical trials have validated the therapeutic potential of Velcade in autoimmunity, these studies highlight the broad therapeutic potential of proteasome inhibition in general and immunoproteasome inhibition in particular for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
 5

Following is a partial list of indications where we may pursue development in the future. In all of the indications below, there is evidence supporting immunoproteasome inhibition as a therapeutic modality. 
 
Autoimmune Disease 
 Autoimmune disease, or autoimmunity, is an immune response directed against the body’s own healthy cells and tissues. Autoimmunity can be caused genetically, by infection, or can arise spontaneously, and the prevalence of these diseases is more prominent in females. Autoimmune disease usually involves an autoreactive response by both T-cells and B-cells, also known as lymphocytes, which attack the body’s cells and tissues. In a healthy individual, as the immune system develops during childhood, autoreactive lymphocytes are eliminated or suppressed by various mechanisms. When any of these mechanisms fail, autoimmunity can arise. The presence of autoantibodies, a product of self-reactive B-cells, which react with the proteins, DNA, and lipids in healthy cells, is a hallmark of these diseases. Many autoimmune diseases are characterized by disease flares, in which symptoms worsen, followed by a period of remission, in which symptoms improve. 
 Many autoimmune diseases are not due to the direct effects of autoantibodies but rather due to other mechanisms that cause immune dysfunction. These include activation of inflammatory T-cells and cytotoxic T-cells, which can cause inflammation and tissue damage, the generation of cytokines that are harmful to the surrounding tissue, or activation of macrophages, a kind of immune cell, which can also lead to cytokine release, as well as cellular damage from free radicals. Examples of autoimmune diseases that we initially intend to target include lupus, lupus nephritis and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. 
 Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect various parts of the body. Most patients present with hematologic, renal or central nervous system manifestations. Significant complications of lupus include damage to joints and kidneys, cardiovascular issues and hematologic abnormalities. Many lupus patients, including those taking immunosuppressive agents and corticosteroids, experience disease flares. Lupus is mild in some people and life threatening in others. Immunologic abnormalities, particularly the production of autoantibodies, are a prominent feature of the disease. 
 6

About half of patients with lupus go on to demonstrate symptoms of renal dysfunction called lupus nephritis during the course of their disease. Autoantibodies, including those reacting with components of the cell’s nucleus, often form immune complexes that deposit in the kidney and interfere with its ability to filter urine, decreasing kidney function and increasing protein found in the urine, or proteinuria. Immune complex deposition in the kidney can also activate other arms of the inflammatory response, including the recruitment of proinflammatory immune cells such as macrophages and T-cells, which further exacerbate kidney damage by secreting inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-6. Lupus nephritis patients have a significantly increased risk of kidney failure and death relative to lupus patients who do not have lupus nephritis. 
 Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are a group of autoimmune diseases in which inflammation occurs in muscles and often in other parts of the body, predominantly the skin. These conditions, which lead to a rash and loss of muscle function, include dermatomyositis, polymyositis, juvenile dermatomyositis, juvenile polymyositis and autoimmune necrotizing myopathy. The cause of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies remains undetermined although most patients present with disease specific autoantibodies. 
 In most autoimmune diseases, initial therapy consists of long-term treatment with a combination of immunosuppressive agents, such as methotrexate or CellCept® (mycophenolate mofetil), and daily administration of high-dose corticosteroids. This treatment regimen results in high rates of infection, increased risk of malignancy and a wide variety of side effects arising from prolonged steroid use and, in diseases such as lupus nephritis, does not induce high rates of clinically meaningful responses. These treatments can be associated with anemia and other serious side effects. Targeted agents, such as TNF-α antagonists, are used in some autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, after immunosuppressive agents have failed. Generally, these agents are ineffective in a wide range of autoimmune diseases, including lupus nephritis and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. However, even if these agents are initially effective, over time patients often experience loss of response. 
 Protein Degradation and Selective Inhibition of the Immunoproteasome 
 Selective inhibition of the immunoproteasome has the potential to reduce inflammation by targeting dysfunctional immune cells involved in autoimmunity, such as T-cells and B-cells, without causing widespread immunosuppression. 
The Constitutive Proteasome and the Immunoproteasome 
 Found in all cells of the body, proteasomes regulate intracellular protein degradation and are essential for many cellular processes such as cell division, cell differentiation and cytokine production. There are two main forms of the proteasome: the constitutive proteasome and the immunoproteasome. In most tissues of the body, the constitutive proteasome is the predominant form. In cells of the immune system, the immunoproteasome is the predominant form. 
 While both forms of the proteasome mediate protein degradation, the two forms of the proteasome accomplish this utilizing different active sites, which are depicted in the figure below. In the immunoproteasome, three active sites, LMP7, LMP2 and MECL1, replace the constitutive proteasome subunits β5, β1 and β2. These active sites are responsible for cleaving and degrading proteins.

 Safety and Efficacy of Approved Proteasome Inhibitors 
 The three proteasome inhibitors approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, Velcade, Kyprolis and Ninlaro, are potent “dual inhibitors” of both the immunoproteasome and the constitutive proteasome, primarily the LMP7 and β5 subunits, respectively. This dual-targeting profile is necessary to make them effective treatments for multiple myeloma. However, dual proteasome inhibition is associated with hematologic issues such as thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anemia, as well as constitutional toxicities such as fatigue and myalgia. In addition, Velcade and Ninlaro are associated with risk of peripheral neuropathy, likely due to the off-target activity of these drugs against proteins found in peripheral neurons. 
 Velcade has demonstrated clinical activity in several autoimmune diseases, including lupus, lupus nephritis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, primary Sjögren’s syndrome and graft-versus-host disease. In preclinical models, proteasome inhibition blocked production of most inflammatory cytokines, including many of those targeted by current biologic drugs. However, long-term, chronic administration of Velcade in the setting of autoimmune diseases is not considered feasible due to its side effect profile, in particular hematologic toxicities and risk of peripheral neuropathy. As a result, this promising drug target has remained untapped for use in the treatment autoimmune diseases. 
 KZR-616 
 Overview 
 We believe we are the only company with a selective immunoproteasome inhibitor that has been nominated as a clinical candidate or is in clinical trials. In addition, we believe that KZR-616, if successfully developed and approved, may have the ability to become the standard of care across a broad range of autoimmune diseases based on the following expected key attributes: 

▪ | broad immunomodulatory activity that may allow it to outperform approved therapies and to work in indications where other drugs have failed;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | lack of significant immunosuppression, a key drawback to other approved therapies in autoimmunity; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | avoidance of systemic toxicities associated with dual proteasome inhibitors and the peripheral neuropathy associated with Velcade and Ninlaro.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first selective immunoproteasome inhibitors were discovered by our co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer and his colleagues at Proteolix, Inc., or Proteolix, in 2005. Proteolix was acquired by Onyx in 2009, and Onyx was acquired by Amgen in 2013. In tests of these compounds in multiple in vitro and in vivo models, it was ascertained that these molecules did not demonstrate cytotoxic activity or potential as anti-cancer agents. However, it was observed that these inhibitors had profound immunomodulatory effects across myriad immune cell types. In over 15 peer-reviewed publications, our selective inhibitors of the immunoproteasome and related compounds have demonstrated strong therapeutic potential in animal models of multiple autoimmune diseases. 
 Broad Immunomodulatory Activity 
 In preclinical models of inflammation, selective inhibitors of the immunoproteasome block cytokine production and result in therapeutic activity equivalent to or better than Velcade or Kyprolis. In mouse models of lupus, our first widely studied selective inhibitor of the immunoproteasome, ONX 0914, showed equivalent efficacy and better tolerability than Velcade. In addition, KZR-616 has been shown to block disease progression and prevent renal damage in animal models of lupus nephritis in a manner that is significantly better than current standard of care therapy, CellCept. This body of research strongly suggests that the therapeutic benefit of Velcade in patients with autoimmune diseases such as lupus is due to targeting of the immunoproteasome. In one of those peer-reviewed publications, ONX 0914 resulted in a deeper anti-inflammatory response relative to Enbrel® (etanercept), a TNF-α antagonist. 
 Lack of Immunosuppression 
 Standard therapies for most autoimmune diseases involve long-term use of immunosuppressive agents and daily administration of corticosteroids, resulting in high rates of infection, increased risk of malignancy and other side effects. In the setting of multiple myeloma, the dual proteasome inhibitors Velcade and Kyprolis are not associated with a high risk of immunosuppression. In animal models, selective immunoproteasome inhibitors showed a lack of immunosuppression, and KZR-616 was shown to mediate an anti-inflammatory response in models of autoimmunity without the addition of steroids. 
 Targeted agents, such as TNF-α antagonists, lack sufficient therapeutic activity in diseases such as lupus and lupus nephritis due in part to broad immune dysfunction in these diseases. Selective immunoproteasome inhibitors, including KZR-616, have shown direct immunomodulatory activity against the vast majority of cytokines and activated immune cells known as effector cells involved in autoimmune diseases. Therefore, we believe KZR-616 represents a novel therapy with the potential to reduce steroid burden and to provide clinical benefit in patients with autoimmune diseases that cannot be treated by current targeted agents.
 Avoids Systemic Toxicity or Neurotoxicity 
 In animal models of toxicology, KZR-616 was able to induce potent inhibition of the immunoproteasome without inducing systemic toxicities seen in animals treated with Kyprolis and Velcade. Specifically, KZR-616 did not induce hematologic abnormalities or indications of cardiovascular, hepatic or renal toxicity in animals, findings that were commonly noted in animals receiving the dual-proteasome inhibitors. In addition, KZR-616, a peptide epoxyketone-based inhibitor of the immunoproteasome, has shown no off-target effects or signs of neurotoxicity in preclinical studies. This finding is in contrast to Velcade and Ninlaro, which are boronic acid-based proteasome inhibitors that induce potent inhibition of several off-targets, including an enzyme required for the normal function of neurons. 
Preclinical Data with Kezar Compounds and Clinical Data with Velcade Support KZR-616 Development 
 Most autoimmune diseases arise in part due to overexpression of secreted proteins called cytokines. Several of these cytokines, such as TNF-α, have been successfully targeted with biologic agents. When applied to human immune cells such as monocytes, selective immunoproteasome inhibitors, like KZR-616 and ONX 0914, blocked the release of inflammatory cytokines following cell stimulation. The cytokines whose secretion is inhibited include IL-23, IL-6, and TNF-α, which are variously targeted by approved monoclonal antibody therapeutics such as Actemra® (tocilizumab), Enbrel, Humira® (adalimumab) and Stelara® (ustekinumab).

Administration of ONX 0914 Blocked the Release of Cytokines 
 


Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which are white blood cells, from healthy donors were stimulated to produce cytokines with the agent lipopolysaccharide. 
 Activated T-cells can induce inflammation when they differentiate into immune effector cells, such as Th1 and Th17, and express cytokines, such as IFN-γ and IL-17. Cosentyx® (secukinumab), which targets IL-17, is approved for certain autoimmune diseases. Inhibition of the immunoproteasome in activated T-cells causes a reduction in Th1 and Th17 activity. Conversely, several autoimmune diseases are thought to be mediated in part by a reduction in the number of regulatory T-cells, or Tregs, which can reduce inflammation in part via secretion of the cytokine TGF-β. Inhibition of the immunoproteasome increases the activity of Treg cells in part via increased TGF-β production. The graph below shows the results from an experiment measuring the effect of immunoproteasome inhibition on human Th1, Th17 and Treg cells following a one hour exposure to ONX 0914 followed by restimulation to measure cytokine release. 
 Immunoproteasome Inhibitor ONX 0914 Blocked Th1 and Th17 
 Inflammatory Cells and Increased Regulatory T-Cell Activity 
 

KZR-616 and ONX 0914 have been observed to be therapeutically active in multiple animal models of autoimmunity, including lupus, lupus nephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and Type 1 diabetes. As shown in the figure below, in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, administration of a single dose of ONX 0914, which induced potent and selective inhibition of the immunoproteasome, was sufficient to induce complete disease remission and inhibit the expression of several inflammatory cytokines in the animals. Inhibition of all three immunoproteasome active sites (LMP7, LMP2 and MECL1) was induced by ONX 0914 with minimal impact on the β5 subunit of the constitutive proteasome. The mice were followed for 14 days for signs of inflammation in their joints, and expression of three inflammatory cytokines was measured on Day 7 of the study. In a peer-reviewed publication, ONX 0914 resulted in a deeper anti-inflammatory response relative to Enbrel.

A Single Dose of ONX 0914 Selectively Inhibited Immunoproteasome Active Sites 
 and Reduced Inflammation and Cytokine Expression in a Rheumatoid Arthritis Model 
 

In a mouse model of lupus nephritis, KZR-616 was compared to the standard of care, CellCept, for 12 weeks of therapy and 8 weeks of follow-up after the last dose. Compared to CellCept, KZR-616 induced a greater improvement in renal response as measured by reduced proteinuria. CellCept was active in this model, but, notably, renal disease progressed as soon as treatment stopped. In the mice treated with once weekly administration of KZR-616, a prolonged prevention of renal disease was noted out to eight weeks after the last dose, suggesting long-lasting immunomodulation. The effects of KZR-616 were not limited to a reduction in proteinuria; KZR-616 therapy also reduced kidney damage (measured histologically), decreased the number of activated B-cells and autoantibody producing B-cells and reduced levels of autoantibodies.

KZR-616 Successfully Treated Renal Disease in a Lupus Nephritis Mouse Model 
 and Outperformed a Standard of Care Therapy 
 

In mice with active lupus nephritis, KZR-616 or CellCept was given to animals for 12 weeks. QD means once per day and QW means once per week. Proteinuria was measured weekly or biweekly for 20 weeks. 
 Immunosuppression, the inability of the body’s immune system to generate antibodies to vaccines or to fight off infection, is a common side effect of many drugs approved for or in development in autoimmunity. To assess the risk of immunosuppression due to treatment with our selective immunoproteasome inhibitors, our scientists and their academic collaborators performed several studies in animal models. Mice receiving daily administration of ONX 0914 experienced no loss in the ability to fight off viral infections. Nonhuman primates receiving weekly doses of KZR-616 raised normal antibody levels following immunization with the antigen KLH. 
 Nonhuman Primates Receiving KZR-616 Demonstrated Normal Antibody Responses 
 

Nonhuman primates were given KZR-616 once per week and were immunized on Day 21 with KLH. Levels of antibodies raised against KLH were measured out to 21 days after immunization. 
 In parallel to the development of immunoproteasome inhibitors at Proteolix and Onyx, independent clinical researchers were exploring the application of the dual proteasome inhibitor Velcade in patients with persistent and treatment refractory autoimmune diseases. In one investigation, Velcade was administered for up to three months in patients with lupus who had previously been treated with standard of care but were still experiencing severe symptoms. Clinical responses were seen in all patients and improvements in disease symptoms were seen as early as 21 days from the start of treatment. In the subset of lupus patients with lupus nephritis, Velcade induced meaningful reduction in proteinuria with a median decrease of over 60% during the treatment period.
12

Velcade Reduced Lupus Disease Severity 
 

16 lupus patients were treated with Velcade for up to 4 treatment cycles. Disease severity as measured by the systemic lupus erythematous disease activity index, or SLEDAI 2K scale, was monitored prior to the first dose of Velcade, after the last dose of Velcade and 6 months after the last dose of Velcade. Median data from all patients are shown. Adapted from Alexander et al. 2015 
 Despite this clinical activity in lupus, Velcade is not suitable for long-term administration in any chronic inflammatory or autoimmune disease. This is due to Velcade’s associated hematologic adverse events such as thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia and induces peripheral neuropathy that can become permanent if dosing is continued for an extended period of time. 
 As shown in the figure below, our selective immunoproteasome inhibitor ONX 0914 was compared to dual targeting proteasome inhibitors Velcade and Kyprolis in mouse models of lupus. ONX 0914 was found to replicate the therapeutic activity of the dual proteasome inhibitors in these models, which strongly suggests that the clinical activity of Velcade and Kyprolis in patients with lupus is due to immunoproteasome inhibition. In fact, selective immunoproteasome inhibition resulted in equivalent efficacy and better tolerability in animal models to that of dual proteasome inhibitors. Also, selective immunoproteasome inhibition induced similar reductions in autoantibodies, cytokine reduction and autoimmune cell reduction to those demonstrated by dual-proteasome inhibitors. 
 Immunoproteasome Inhibition Was as Effective as Velcade and Kyprolis in Mouse Models of 
 Lupus and Lupus Nephritis 
 

In mice with active nephritis, ONX 0914, Velcade or Kyprolis was given to animals for 12 weeks. Renal disease was measured by monitoring proteinuria and at the end of study kidneys were analyzed by histology for disease-related changes.

Our Phase 1a Clinical Data with KZR-616 
 In 2017, we completed a Phase 1a clinical trial in Australia to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, or PK, pharmacodynamics, or PD, and immunomodulatory activity of KZR-616 in 82 healthy volunteers. In this trial, KZR-616 or a placebo was administered as a single dose or repeat-weekly subcutaneous administration over four weeks. Results from the trial, including the data and figures below, were presented at the 2017 American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting.
 Administration of KZR-616 to healthy volunteers resulted in a dose-dependent increase in exposure and inhibition of immunoproteasome activity. Selective inhibition of the immunoproteasome over the constitutive proteasome was demonstrated using multiple PD assays. Cytokine levels in ex vivo stimulation assays demonstrated an anti-cytokine effect of KZR-616 treatment consistent with preclinical models. Single and weekly administration at a dose that resulted in potent inhibition of the immunoproteasome were well tolerated and did not result in any of the hematologic adverse events that are often seen with Velcade and Kyprolis. In addition, there were no changes in liver or kidney function, ECG abnormalities, prolonged constitutional adverse events, or signs of immunosuppression with weekly administration of KZR-616.
 In our Phase 1a healthy volunteer study, we observed that PK and PD were consistent across subjects and with repeat dosing. The graphs below show the proteasome subunit inhibition profiles in healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of either 30, 45, or 60 mg of KZR-616. At a 30 mg dose, 75% of the subjects (9 of 12) achieved the desired inhibition of the immunoproteasome subunits LMP7 and LMP2 and all subjects avoided 80% inhibition of the ß5 subunit of the constitutive proteasome. In contrast, Kyprolis induces greater than 80% inhibition of both LMP7 and ß5 at its labeled dose. All subjects receiving a dose of 45 or 60 mg achieved the desired inhibition of both LMP7 and LMP2 and also avoided excessive inhibition of the ß5 subunit. 
 KZR-616 Inhibited Both LMP7 and LMP2 While Avoiding Excessive Inhibition of ß5, thereby Demonstrating Selective Immunoproteasome Inhibition 
 

In Phase 1a subjects receiving subcutaneous administration of KZR-616, the most common adverse events, or AEs, were injection site reactions that were generally mild and transient and did not appear to increase in severity or frequency with repeat dosing. In addition, at the 60 mg dose level, two separate cohorts of six subjects each received a single dose of KZR-616. In the second cohort, 4 of 6 subjects receiving drug experienced AEs with a preferred term of adverse drug reactions, namely hypotension, sinus tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and rigors and chills. Two of these subjects’ reactions were classified as Grade 2 and were recorded as serious adverse events, or SAEs. These systemic drug reactions appear similar to reactions reported upon initial infusion of carfilzomib. These findings were not seen with repeat dosing at 45 mg, and we conducted no repeat dosing at the 60 mg dose level. 
 In order to determine whether KZR-616 was having a biologic effect in healthy volunteers, blood samples were taken before and after dosing and stimulated ex vivo to induce release of cytokines from white blood cells in the blood samples. We observed that after repeat dose administration of KZR-616 at a dose of 45 mg, there was significantly reduced release of cytokines compared to subjects receiving placebo. The following figure shows the profile of proteasome subunit inhibition in the healthy volunteers receiving 45 mg of KZR-616 and the resulting reduction in cytokine release following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, or LPS.
 14

Profile of Proteasome Subunit Inhibition in Healthy Volunteers Receiving KZR-616 and the Resulting Inhibition of Cytokine Release Following Stimulation 
 

This profile of proteasome subunit inhibition is very similar to that observed when we treat white blood cells in vitro and stimulate them to release the same cytokines. As seen in the figure below, we demonstrated in vitro with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or PBMC, that a similar immunoproteasome subunit inhibition profile resulted in a comparable biologic response, namely inhibition of cytokine release. 
Profile of Proteasome Subunit Inhibition in PBMC Exposed In Vitro to KZR-616 and the Resulting Inhibition of Cytokine Release Following Stimulation 
 
Similarly, we have also shown that a dose of KZR-616 in mice can induce a similar immunoproteasome inhibition profile to that seen in human cells treated in vitro and in healthy volunteers receiving a dose of 45 mg. When KZR-616 was administered weekly for 12 weeks in a mouse model of lupus, mice saw a complete resolution of their nephritis, as measured by the absence of proteinuria. 
 15

Profile of Proteasome Subunit Inhibition in Mice Receiving KZR-616 and the Resulting Remission of Proteinuria in a Mouse Model of Lupus Nephritis 
 
These data sets demonstrate a consistency of immunoproteasome inhibition profiles and anti-inflammatory activity across both preclinical and clinical settings. We believe these data, together with our other preclinical data demonstrating inhibition of multiple inflammatory cytokines and efficacy in animal models of autoimmune diseases, demonstrate the potential for KZR-616 to be a promising new agent for the treatment of several autoimmune disorders. 
Ongoing and Planned Clinical Development 
 Following the completion of our Phase 1a clinical trial in healthy volunteers, we filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, with the Division of Pulmonary and Rheumatology Products at the FDA. 
 The IND is currently open with the FDA, and in March 2018, we began enrollment of patients in KZR-616-002, a multi-center Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in patients with lupus and lupus nephritis. The Phase 1b portion includes open-label dose escalation in patients with active lupus (with and without lupus nephritis) who have failed to respond to at least one standard therapeutic regimen, such as Benlysta® (belimumab) or an immunosuppressive agent such as CellCept® (mycophenolate mofetil)
. All patients must have a SLEDAI (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index) score of 4 or higher and must have measurable levels of autoantibodies. In this portion of the trial, we plan to enroll up to four cohorts of four to six patients each at dose levels of 45, 60, 75 and 90 mg. Each patient will receive up to 13 weekly subcutaneous administrations of KZR-616, and new cohorts will initiate enrollment after the previous cohort clears a four-week safety review. Enrollment is ongoing. The primary endpoints of both portions of the trial are safety and tolerability. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include PK, PD and biomarker assessments and measures of efficacy. We intend to use the data generated from the Phase 1b portion to select the doses for the Phase 2 portion of the trial. Initial top-line results from the Phase 1b portion of the trial are expected in the second quarter of 2019.
 The Phase 1b portion of KZR-616-002 allows for two additional expansion cohorts in which we may evaluate KZR-616 in different subsets of patients or with different dosing regimens. If we choose to pursue these cohorts, we expect to initiate enrollment of these cohorts in 2019. 
 Once the dose levels of 45 and 60 mg have cleared safety review in the Phase 1b portion of the trial, we intend to commence the Phase 2 portion and remain on track to do so in the second quarter of 2019. The Phase 2 portion is a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KZR-616 in patients with active proliferative lupus nephritis. Inclusion criteria include patients with active proliferative lupus nephritis (Class III or IV ±V) who are undergoing induction therapy with CellCept and prednisone and have been treated for one to three months with this regimen. Patients will be randomized equally to one of three arms, KZR-616 at 1 of 2 doses or placebo. All patients will remain on their background induction therapy during the 13-week treatment period. 
 In January 2019, we began enrolling healthy female subjects in a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, single and multiple ascending dose study to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, and target inhibition of a 
 16

simplified lyophilized formulation of KZR-616. The trial is being conducted in Australia and will enroll up to 72 healthy female subjects. A simplified lyophilized formulation of KZR-616 has the potential to improve the ease of drug administration, transportation, storage and ease of administration. Additionally, data from this trial may be used to support development and potential regulatory approval.
 We plan to initiate Phase 2 trials in up to four additional indications in 2019 to assess the safety, pharmacology and clinical activity of KZR-616 in autoimmune diseases. The first of these will likely be a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with dermatomyositis and polymyositis. We expect to select additional indications based on assessment of clinical and regulatory feasibility and scientific evidence demonstrating a potential therapeutic benefit for KZR-616. We expect these indications to be autoimmune diseases that are orphan indications or other areas of high unmet medical need.
 If our early trials demonstrate meaningful clinical activity, we intend to apply for various regulatory designations, possibly including Breakthrough Therapy designation, Fast Track designation or orphan drug designation. Receiving any of these designations could result in priority review from the FDA upon submission of a marketing application. In addition, some orphan indications we are considering may require smaller safety databases and therefore smaller numbers of patients for approval. Finally, by targeting indications with high unmet medical need, KZR-616 may face less competition and, if approved, enjoy a better chance of rapid uptake by physicians and patients eager to find effective treatments. 
 Protein Secretion and the Sec61 Translocon 
 We are conducting research and discovery efforts targeting protein secretion pathways as potential therapies for oncology and immuno-oncology. In mammalian cells, the secretion of proteins such as cytokines and the expression of cell surface transmembrane proteins such as cytokine receptors involve a process called cotranslational translocation. This process entails the insertion of nascent polypeptides, which are proteins, into the endoplasmic reticulum, or ER, of the cell. For most proteins, this insertion into the ER occurs via the Sec61 translocon, a highly conserved multi-subunit protein complex found in the membrane of the ER of all cells. Inhibition of the Sec61 translocon with small molecules blocks the secretion of some or all proteins, which can result in several physiologic outcomes, including altered cellular function, inhibition of cytokine release and/or cell death.
 We are currently conducting multiple drug discovery campaigns within our protein secretion research program. Our two main approaches are to discover and develop small molecule therapeutics that target the interaction of the unique signal sequences of newly created proteins with the Sec61 translocon, which we refer to as specific protein secretion inhibitors or SPSIs, and to block protein secretion broadly with agents, referred to as cotransins. Some of our drug discovery campaigns within our protein secretion research program have reached the stage of animal testing, including animal models of cancer, with promising initial results. 
 Our scientists and co-founder Dr. Jack Taunton of UCSF, have developed a significant level of proprietary knowledge around Sec61 translocon biology, the pharmacology and toxicology of protein secretion inhibitors, and know-how for determination of optimal properties for drug candidates.
 We believe this program is advancing well and will be showcased in two poster presentations at the upcoming American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in Atlanta, GA on April 2, 2019. We remain on track to nominate a first clinical candidate in oncology this year.
 License Agreement with Onyx 
 In June 2015, in connection with an issuance of 1,121,384 shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock to Onyx, we entered into a license agreement with Onyx, or the Onyx license agreement. Pursuant to the Onyx license agreement, Onyx granted us an exclusive license under certain patent rights, and a non-exclusive license to certain know-how, in each case controlled by Onyx and relating to our immunoproteasome program, to develop, manufacture or commercialize any pharmaceutical product containing certain types of compounds that are selective for the immunoproteasome for any and all uses other than those related to the diagnosis and/or treatment in humans 
 17

of cancerous or pre-cancerous diseases and/or conditions, including those related to hematological diseases and/or conditions that are not inflammatory diseases or disorders. 
 Under the Onyx license agreement, we are obligated to pay Onyx milestone payments of up to $172.5 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestones. Commencing upon the first commercial sale of a licensed product, we must make royalty payments to Onyx on net sales of such licensed products based on tiered annual net sales thresholds at varying royalty rates ranging in the mid to high single digits, subject to certain customary reductions. We must pay such royalties on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of the expiration of all licensed patents that claim such product in such country, the loss of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country and the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country. The licensed product patent portfolio includes issued patents in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, Mexico, Singapore and South Korea with expiration dates ranging from 2027 to 2034, absent any patent extensions available. For more information on our intellectual property, see “Business — Intellectual Property.” Upon the expiration of such royalty term in such country, our license to such product will become fully paid-up, irrevocable, and non-exclusive. 
 Under the Onyx license agreement, Onyx has a right of first negotiation to obtain a license, or a similar transfer of rights, to develop and/or commercialize any licensed product. 
 The Onyx license agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of last-to-expire royalty term for any licensed product in the territory. The license agreement may be terminated by us with prior notice, by either party in the event of a material breach by the other 
party that remains uncured for a certain number of days, such number depending on the type of breach, by either party for insolvency of the other party, or immediately by Onyx if we challenge any of the licensed patents. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We intend to build a commercial infrastructure to support sales of KZR-616 in the United States. We expect to manage sales, marketing and distribution through internal resources and third-party relationships. While we may commit significant financial and management resources to commercial activities, we will also consider collaborating with one or more pharmaceutical companies to enhance our commercial capabilities. Outside the United States, we plan to seek pharmaceutical partners for sales and marketing activities. 
Manufacturing 
 Our internal manufacturing capabilities include production of small-scale quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for characterization and preclinical assessment of product candidates. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities compliant with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and we do not have plans to develop our own cGMP manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. 
 We currently rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for all of our required raw materials, API and finished product for our clinical trials and for most of our preclinical research. We also contract with additional third parties for the filling, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of investigational drug products. We maintain agreements with our CMOs that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to KZR-616. We obtain our supplies from these CMOs on a purchase order basis, and do not have long term supply agreements in place. We do not have arrangements in place for redundant supply; however, we believe we can identify and establish additional CMOs to provide API and finished drug product without significant disruption to our business or clinical development timelines. 
 Development and commercial quantities of any products that we develop will need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the requirements of the FDA and the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval. If KZR-616 is approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with a third-party contract manufacturer and one or more backup manufacturers for the commercial production of KZR-616. 
 18

Starting with the Phase 2 trial, KZR-616 will be a lyophilized product candidate, meaning it is freeze-dried and must be reconstituted with water prior to delivery to a patient. While lyophilized products are common in the drug industry, we intend that if approved and commercialized, KZR-616 will be self-administered by patients via a dual-chamber system. There are several technical challenges we will need to solve related to the use of a self-administered dual-chamber system, including whether KZR-616 is amenable to use in such a device and is sufficiently stable to meet regulatory requirements. In addition, we will need to enter into an additional agreement with a CMO to manufacture the self-administered dual-chamber system. We are aware of only one company that manufactures a self-administered dual-chamber system that has received FDA approval. 
 Competition 
 Drug development is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological advancements. Our ability to compete will significantly depend upon our ability to complete necessary clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, and effectively market any drug that we may successfully develop. Our current and potential future competitors include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and government agencies. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of any product candidate for which we may receive marketing approval include efficacy, safety, tolerability, dosing convenience, price, coverage and reimbursement. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the United States and in foreign countries. 
 Our current and potential future competitors may also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors. 
 Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for the disorders we are targeting by a competitor could render our current or future product candidates non-competitive or obsolete or reduce the demand for our product candidates before we can recover our development and commercialization expenses. 
 We are aware of two companies engaged in drug discovery and development of selective inhibitors of the immunoproteasome.  Principia Biopharma, Inc. is currently engaged in pre-clinical research focused on the discovery of orally bioavailable and selective inhibitors of the immunoproteasome. Merck KgaA has recently disclosed an LMP7-selective inhibitor that has been nominated for clinical development in Multiple Myeloma. There has been no mention of clinical trials in autoimmune disorders.
 Currently, lupus is treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine. Current guidance for the treatment of proliferative lupus nephritis involves induction therapy with either CellCept or Cytoxan® (cyclophosphamide) and corticosteroids. In addition, Benlysta, an anti-BAFF monoclonal antibody from GlaxoSmithKline is approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate to severe lupus but not lupus nephritis. 
 Other companies are developing agents to treat both lupus and lupus nephritis. In lupus, these agents include antibodies against the interferon alpha receptor, such as anifrolumab from AstraZeneca, and against IL-23/IL-12, such as Stelara from Janssen Biotech, Inc., and small molecule agents targeting JAK, such as baricitinib from Eli Lilly and Co., cereblon from Celgene, and BTK, such as evobrutinib, under evaluation by Merck KgaA. 
 In active, proliferative lupus nephritis, other companies are developing novel agents to add to the standard induction regimens and include Benlysta, anifrolumab and the investigational immunosuppressive agent, voclosporin, from Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Intellectual Property
 Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our technology platform, product candidates, novel biological discoveries, new therapeutic approaches and potential indications, and other inventions that are important to our business. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how that is not patentable, we rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. We require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information and requiring disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. 
 For our product candidates, generally we initially pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter and methods of use. Throughout the development of our product candidates, we seek to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including through additional methods of use, process of making, and salt and polymorph related claims. 
 In total, our patent portfolio, including patents licensed from Onyx, comprises 11 different patent families, filed in various jurisdictions worldwide, including families directed to composition of matter for selective immunoproteasome inhibitors and protein secretion inhibitors. Four additional patent filings for new composition of matter subject matter were filed in the first quarter of 2019. Our patent portfolio includes issued patents in, among other jurisdictions, the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, Mexico, Singapore and South Korea with expiration dates ranging from 2027 to 2034. Our patent portfolio is outlined below: 
 Selective Immunoproteasome Inhibitors 
 PRTX-019—Initial composition of matter patent covering selective immunoproteasome inhibitors, which also covers ONX 0914, our tool compound found in multiple publications. We have issued patents in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, Mexico, Singapore and South Korea. The 20-year term of this family is June 2027, absent any patent term extensions available. 
 PRTX-039—composition of matter patent covering selective immunoproteasome inhibitors, including selective LMP7 inhibitors and dual LMP7/LMP2 inhibitors. We have issued patents in the United States, Europe, Eurasia, Australia, China, Columbia, Saudi Arabia and Singapore. This patent covers KZR-616 and its closely related analogs. The 20-year term of this family is March 2034, absent any patent term extensions available. 
 PRTX-041—composition of matter patent covering selective immunoproteasome inhibitors of the LMP2 subunit. We have issued patents in the United States, Europe, Eurasia, China, Mexico and Singapore. The 20-year term of this family is March 2034, absent any patent term extensions available. 
 KZR-616 Synthetic Process – patent application pending in numerous jurisdictions, directed to process for preparing KZR-616.  No patents have been issued yet, but the 20-year term for this family is expected to be June 2037, absent any patent term extensions available.
 KZR-616 Salts and Polymorphs– patent application pending in numerous jurisdictions, directed to various salts and polymorphs of KZR-616, including the clinical salt form.  No patents have been issued yet, but the 20-year term for this family is expected to be June 2037, absent any patent term extensions available.
 Proteasome Inhibitor Combination Therapies – Two patent families directed to combination therapies for immunoproteasome inhibitors are pending, with no issued patents yet.  A first, directed to the combination of selective LMP7 and LMP2 inhibitors, that is, the combination of PRTX-039 + PRTX-041 inhibitors, for the treatment of autoimmune diseases is expected to have a 20-year term of September 2038, absent any patent term extensions available.  The second is directed to the combination of KZR-616 and related analogs and immunomodulator drugs, such as mycophenolate mofetil, for the treatment of lupus, lupus nephritis and other autoimmune diseases. The 20-year term of this family is expected to be August 2038, absent any patent term extensions available. 
 20


KZR-616 Formulation – patent application directed to formulations of KZR-616, filed provisionally in October 2018.  We expect the non-provisional application to be filed in October 2019.  No patents have issued yet, but the 20-year term of this family is expected to be October 2039, absent any patent term extensions available.
 We expect to file future applications for new composition of matter for second generation selective inhibitors of the immunoproteasome pending results from ongoing drug discovery efforts. 
 Protein Secretion Modulators 
 Our scientists and the laboratory of our co-founder, Dr. Jack Taunton of UCSF, have developed a significant level of proprietary knowledge around Sec61 translocon biology, the pharmacology and toxicology of protein secretion inhibitors, and know-how for determination of optimal properties for product candidates. We have filed three applications around protein secretion inhibitors directed to different scaffolds currently being pursued by us alone or in collaboration with the Taunton Lab at UCSF and expect to file additional applications in this area in 2019. 
Patent Term and Term Extensions 
 Individual patents have terms for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications filed in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the restoration period cannot extend the patent term beyond 14 years from FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. All taxes or annuities for a patent, as required by the USPTO and various foreign jurisdictions, must be timely paid in order for the patent to remain in force during this period of time. 
 The actual protection afforded by a patent may vary on a product by product basis, from country to country, and can depend upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 Our patents and patent applications are subject to procedural or legal challenges by others. We may be unable to obtain, maintain and protect the intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business, and we may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, which could materially harm our business. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 Trademarks and Know-How 
 In connection with the ongoing development and advancement of our products and services in the United States and various international jurisdictions, we seek to create protection for our marks and enhance their value by pursuing trademarks and service marks where available and when appropriate. In addition to patent and trademark protection, we rely upon know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 21

Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 KZR-616 is designed to be delivered to patients via a self-administered dual-chamber system. In the United States, products composed of components that would normally be regulated by different centers at the FDA are known as combination products. While we expect that KZR-616 will be regulated as a drug and its delivery device will be evaluated with it as a single product, we cannot be certain that the FDA would not require independent clearance or approval for the self-administered dual-chamber system delivery. Whether approved separately or under a single New Drug Application, or NDA, our self-administered dual-chamber system will have to meet medical device regulatory requirements, including design verification and validation and human factors testing. 
 United States Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves: 
  
▪ | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


▪ | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | payment of user fees; and
--+--------------------------


▪ | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, 
 22

together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted, at least annually, to the FDA, and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements, or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Marketing Approval 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
 23

The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. 
 The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and takes several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all. 
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000, there is no reasonable expectation that sales of the drug in the United States will be 
 24

sufficient to offset the costs of developing and making the drug available in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If the FDA approves a sponsor’s marketing application for a designated orphan drug for use in the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the sponsor is eligible for a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, during which the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for a drug with the same active moiety and intended for the same use or indication as the approved orphan drug, except in limited circumstances, such as if a subsequent sponsor demonstrates its product is clinically superior. During a sponsor’s orphan drug exclusivity period, competitors, however, may receive approval for drugs with different active moieties for the same indication as the approved orphan drug, or for drugs with the same active moiety as the approved orphan drug, but for different indications. Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for a drug with the same active moiety intended for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that grounds for withdrawal of the orphan drug exclusivity exist, or that our product is clinically superior. Further, if a designated orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the rare disease or condition for which it received orphan drug designation, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
 Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted. If the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that are designed to treat serious conditions, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, these six- and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. 
 Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease 
 25

or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or other labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. 
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
▪ | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our current and future business operations, including our clinical research activities, and proposed sales, marketing and education programs and constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers and other parties through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those laws described below. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and others, on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. 
 A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing 
 27

or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which are not pre-empted by HIPAA, differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, as well as state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures or drug pricing. Additional state and local laws also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales and medical representatives. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative, criminal and civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, data privacy and security laws, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 The future commercial success of our product candidates or any of our collaborators’ ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our product candidates. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government, through the Medicare or Medicaid programs, provides reimbursement for such treatments. In the United States, the European Union, or EU, and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in 
 28

average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical products. For example, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party payor reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that third-party payors and healthcare providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party payor coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part. 
 Impact of Healthcare Reform on our Business 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, if approved. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts, which include major legislative initiatives to reduce the cost of care through changes in the healthcare system, including limits on the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded healthcare programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing. 
 There have been several U.S. government initiatives over the past few years to fund and incentivize certain comparative effectiveness research, including creation of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the PPACA. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our product candidates to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our product on a profitable basis. 
 The PPACA became law in March 2010 and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other measures that may have an impact on our business, the PPACA established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Additionally, the PPACA extends manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability, expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, and expands entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program. Since enacted, there have 
 29

been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect such challenges and amendments to continue. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, included a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the PPACA will impact the PPACA.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, then President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which began in 2013 and, following passage of subsequent legislation, including the BBA, will continue through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted and, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. 
 In addition, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contained further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. For example, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On January 31, 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, proposed modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. While some proposed measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

As a result of the PPACA, Medicare payments are increasingly tied to quality of care and value measures, and reporting of related data by providers such as physicians and hospitals. So called “value based reimbursement” measures may present challenges as well as potential opportunities for biopharmaceutical manufacturers. Medicare incentives for providers meeting certain quality measures may ultimately prove beneficial for manufacturers that are able to establish that their products may help providers to meet such measures. However, manufacturers’ ability to market their drug products based on quality or value is highly regulated and not always permissible. In addition, potentially decreased Medicare reimbursement to those providers that fail to adequately comply with quality reporting requirements could translate to decreased resources available to purchase products and may negatively impact marketing or utilization of our product candidates if they are approved for marketing. We cannot predict at this time what impact, if any, the longer-term shift towards value based reimbursement will have on any of our product candidates in either the Medicare program, or in any other third party payor programs that may similarly tie payment to provider quality. 
 Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 Foreign Regulation 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. For example, in the EU, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application, or CTA, in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 24 full-time employees, 18 of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities and 9 of whom had an M.D. or Ph.D. degree. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good.
