ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
Tidewater Inc., a Delaware corporation that is a listed company on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “TDW”, provides offshore marine support and transportation services to the global offshore energy industry through the operation of a diversified fleet of marine service vessels. We were incorporated in 1956 and conduct our operations through wholly-owned United States (U.S.) and international subsidiaries, as well as through joint ventures in which Tidewater has either majority or occasionally non-controlling interests (generally where required to satisfy local ownership or local content requirements). Unless otherwise required by the context, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “the company” as used herein refer to Tidewater Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and predecessors. 
 
On July 31, 2017, Tidewater successfully emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and adopted fresh-start accounting. Refer to Notes (4) and (5) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on our Chapter 11 bankruptcy and emergence and the adoption of fresh-start accounting. 
 
About Tidewater 
 
Our vessels and associated vessel services provide support for all phases of offshore oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. These services include towing of, and anchor handling for, mobile offshore drilling units; transporting supplies and personnel necessary to sustain drilling, workover and production activities; offshore construction and seismic and subsea support; and a variety of specialized services such as pipe and cable laying. In addition, we have one of the broadest geographic operating footprints in the offshore vessel industry.
 Our principal customers are large, international oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production companies (IOCs); select independent exploration and production (E&P) companies; foreign government-owned or government-controlled organizations and other related companies that explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas (NOCs); drilling contractors; and other companies that provide various services to the offshore energy industry, including but not limited to, offshore construction companies, diving companies and well stimulation companies. 
 
Our offshore support vessel fleet consists primarily of company owned vessels some of which are operated under joint ventures, as well as vessels that have been stacked or withdrawn from service. At December 31, 2018, we owned 257 vessels (excluding five joint venture vessels, but including 92 stacked vessels) available to serve the global energy industry. Please refer to Note (1) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our stacked vessels. 
 Our revenues, net earnings and cash flows from operations are largely dependent upon the activity level of our offshore support vessel fleet. Our business activity is largely dependent on offshore exploration, field development and production activity by our customers. Our customers’ business activity, in turn, is dependent on actual and expected crude oil and natural gas prices, which fluctuate depending on expected future levels of supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas, and on estimates of the cost (and relative cost) of finding, developing and producing reserves. 
 
Depending on vessel capabilities and availability, our vessels operate in the shallow, intermediate and deepwater offshore markets. Deepwater oil and gas development typically involves significant capital investment and multi-year development plans. Although these projects are generally less susceptible to short-term fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas, deepwater exploration and development projects can be costly relative to other onshore and offshore exploration and development. As a result, the sustained low levels of crude oil prices over the past few years has caused, and may continue to cause, many E&P companies to restrain their level of capital expenditures in regards to deepwater projects. 
 Revenues are derived primarily from vessel time charter or similar contracts that are generally from three months to several years in duration, and, to a lesser extent, from vessel time charter contracts on a “spot” basis, which is a short-term (one day to three months) agreement to provide offshore marine services to a customer for a specific short-term job. The base rate of hire for a term contract is generally a fixed rate, though some charter arrangements allow us to recover specific additional costs.

Business Combination
 On November 15, 2018 (the “Merger Date”), we completed our acquisition of GulfMark Offshore, Inc. (“GulfMark”) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated July 15, 2018 (the “business combination”). The business combination was effected through a two-step reverse merger, pursuant to which (i) Gorgon Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary, merged with and into GulfMark, with GulfMark continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary (the “First Merger”) and then, immediately afterwards, (ii) GulfMark merged with and into Gorgon NewCo, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary (“Gorgon”), with Gorgon continuing as the surviving entity and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary. GulfMark’s results are included in our consolidated results beginning on the Merger Date. Refer to Note (2) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on our merger with GulfMark. Upon consummation, the transaction taken as a whole included the issuance of new common stock and additional common stock warrants and the use of GulfMark and Tidewater cash to repay the GulfMark indebtedness as described below. 
 
Upon consummation, GulfMark shareholders received 1.10 (the “Exchange Ratio”) shares of Tidewater common stock in exchange for each share of GulfMark owned.  Outstanding GulfMark Creditor Warrants (“GLF Creditor Warrants”) and GulfMark Equity Warrants (“GLF Equity Warrants”) were assumed from GulfMark with each warrant becoming exercisable for 1.10 shares of Tidewater common stock on substantially the same terms and conditions as provided in the warrant agreements governing the GLF Creditor Warrants and the GLF Equity Warrants. All outstanding GulfMark restricted stock units (awards granted to GulfMark directors and management prior to the merger) were converted into substantially similar awards to acquire Tidewater common stock with the number of restricted stock units being adjusted by the Exchange Ratio. The fair value of the Tidewater common stock and warrants issued as part of the consideration paid for GulfMark was determined based on the closing price of Tidewater’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on November 14, 2018. Immediately following the completion of the business combination, the former Tidewater stockholders and GulfMark stockholders owned 74% and 26% of the combined company, respectively.  In addition, at consummation, we utilized $28.0 million of cash from GulfMark and $72.0 million of cash on hand to repay the $100 million outstanding balance of GulfMark’s Term Loan Facility. This business combination transaction, as a whole, resulted in a total purchase consideration of $385.5 million.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Change in Fiscal Year End
 
Refer to Note (1) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on our change in fiscal year end.
Offices and Facilities 
 Our worldwide headquarters and principal executive offices are located at 6002 Rogerdale Road, Suite 600, Houston, Texas 77072, and our telephone number is (713) 470-5300. Our U.S. marine operations are based in Amelia, Louisiana and Houston, Texas. We conduct our international operations through facilities and offices located in over 30 countries. Our principal international offices and/or warehouse facilities, most of which are leased, are located in Rio de Janeiro and Macae, Brazil; Ciudad Del Carmen, Mexico; Port of Spain and Chaguaramus, Trinidad; Aberdeen, Scotland; Amsterdam, Holland; Cairo, Egypt; Luanda and Cabinda, Angola; Lagos and Onne Port, Nigeria; Douala, Cameroon; Singapore; Al Khobar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; and Oslo, Sandnes and Tromso, Norway. Our operations generally do not require highly specialized facilities, and suitable facilities are generally available on a leased basis as required. 
Our Global Vessel Fleet
 We operate one of the largest fleets of offshore support vessels among our competitors in the industry. The average age of our 257 owned vessels (excluding joint-venture vessels) at December 31, 2018 was approximately 9.6 years. The average age of our 165 active vessels (owned vessels less stacked vessels) at December 31, 2018 was 8.7 years. Of our 257 vessels, 137 are deepwater platform supply vessels (PSVs) or deepwater anchor handling towing supply (AHTS) vessels, and 91 vessels are non-deepwater towing-supply vessels, which include both smaller PSVs and smaller AHTS vessels that primarily serve the jack-up and other non-deepwater drilling markets. Included within our “other” vessel class are 29 vessels that are primarily crew boats and offshore tugs.

The “Vessel Count, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Construction Programs” section of Item 7 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains a table comparing the actual December 31, 2018 vessel count and the average number of vessels by class and geographic distribution during the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
 Our Vessel Classifications 
 Our vessels routinely move from one geographic region and reporting segment to another, and from one operating area to another operating area within the geographic regions and reporting segments. We disclose our vessel statistical information, including revenue, utilization and average day rates, by vessel class. Discussed below are our three major vessel classes along with a description of the type of vessels categorized in each vessel class and the services the respective vessels typically perform. Tables comparing the average size of our vessel fleet by class and geographic distribution for the last three fiscal years are included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Deepwater Vessels 
 Deepwater vessels, in the aggregate, are generally our largest contributor to consolidated vessel revenue and vessel operating margin. Included in this vessel class are large PSVs (typically longer than 230-feet and/or with greater than 2,800 tons in dead weight cargo carrying capacity) and large, higher-horsepower AHTS vessels (generally greater than 10,000 horsepower). These vessels are generally chartered to customers for use in transporting supplies and equipment from shore bases to deepwater and intermediate water depth offshore drilling rigs and production platforms and for otherwise supporting intermediate and deepwater drilling, production, construction and maintenance operations. Deepwater PSVs generally have large cargo carrying capacities, both below deck (liquid mud tanks and dry bulk tanks) and above deck. Deepwater AHTS vessels are equipped to tow drilling rigs and other marine equipment, as well as to set anchors for the positioning and mooring of drilling rigs that generally do not have dynamic positioning capabilities. Many of our deepwater PSVs and AHTS vessels are outfitted with dynamic positioning capabilities, which allow the vessels to maintain an absolute or relative position when mooring to an offshore installation, rig or another vessel is deemed unsafe, impractical or undesirable. Many of our deepwater vessels also have oil recovery, firefighting, standby rescue and/or other specialized equipment. Our customers have high standards in regards to safety and other operational competencies and capabilities, in part to meet the regulatory standards that continue to be more stringent. 
 Our deepwater class of vessel also includes specialty vessels that can support offshore well stimulation, construction work, subsea services and/or serve as remote accommodation facilities. These vessels are generally available for routine supply and towing services, but are also outfitted, and primarily intended, for specialty services. For example, these vessels can be equipped with a variety of lifting and deployment systems, including large capacity cranes, winches or reel systems. 
 Towing-Supply Vessels 
 Included in this class are non-deepwater AHTS vessels with horsepower below 10,000 BHP, and non-deepwater PSVs that are generally less than 230 feet in length. The vessels in this class perform the same respective functions and services as deepwater AHTS vessels and deepwater PSVs except towing-supply vessels are generally chartered to customers for use in intermediate and shallow waters. 
 Other Vessels 
 Our “Other” vessels include crew boats, utility vessels and offshore tugs. Crew boats and utility vessels are chartered to customers for use in transporting personnel and supplies from shore bases to offshore drilling rigs, platforms and other installations. These vessels are also often equipped for oil field security missions in markets where piracy, kidnapping or other potential violence presents a concern. Offshore tugs are used to tow floating drilling rigs and barges; to assist in the docking of tankers; and to assist pipe laying, cable laying and construction barges.

Customers and Contracting 
 Our operations are dependent upon the levels of activity in offshore crude oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production throughout the world, which are affected by trends in global crude oil and natural gas pricing, including expectations of future commodity pricing, which are ultimately influenced by the supply and demand relationship for these natural resources. The activity levels of our customers are also influenced by the cost (and relative cost) of exploring for and producing crude oil and natural gas offshore, which can be affected by environmental regulations, technological advances that affect energy production and consumption, significant weather conditions, the ability of our customers to raise capital, and local and international economic and political environments, including government mandated moratoriums. 
 Our primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts on our vessels on a rate per day of service basis; therefore, vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period. 
 The following table discloses our customers that accounted for 10% or more of total revenues: 
 
 
 | Successor | | | | Predecessor | 
-------------------------+-------------------+------+---+-------------------+-------------+-----

(B) | A significant portion of this customer’s revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 was the result of the early termination of a long-term vessel charter contract.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

While it is normal for our customer base to change over time as our vessel time charter contracts turn over, the unexpected loss of any of these significant customers could, at least in the short term, have a material adverse effect on our vessel utilization and our results of operations. Our five and ten largest customers accounted for approximately 58% and 68% of our total revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.

Competition 
 We have numerous mid-size and large competitors. The principal competitive factors for the offshore vessel service industry are the suitability and availability of vessels and related equipment, price and quality of service. In addition, the ability to demonstrate a strong safety record and attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel are also important competitive factors. We have numerous competitors in all areas in which we operate around the world, and the business environment in all of these markets is highly competitive. 
 
Our diverse, mobile asset base and the wide geographic distribution of our assets generally enable us to respond relatively quickly to changes in market conditions and to provide a broad range of vessel services to customers around the world. We believe that size, age, diversity and geographic distribution of a vessel operator’s fleet, economies of scale and experience level in the many areas of the world are competitive advantages in our industry.  In the Americas region, we benefit from the provisions of the Jones Act, which limits vessels that can operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to those with U.S. ownership. Also, in certain foreign countries, preferences given to vessels owned by local companies may be mandated by local law or by national oil companies. We have attempted to mitigate some of the impact of such preferences through affiliations with local companies.
 
Increases in worldwide vessel capacity generally have the effect of lowering charter rates, particularly when there are lower levels of exploration, field development and production activity as has been the case since late calendar 2014 when oil prices began to trend lower. 
 
Sonatide Joint Venture 
 
We previously disclosed the significant financial and operational challenges that we confront with respect to operations in Angola, as well as steps that we have taken to address or mitigate those risks. Most of our attention has been focused in three areas: (i) reducing the net receivable balance due from Sonatide, our Angolan joint venture with Sonangol, for vessel services; (ii) reducing the foreign currency risk created by virtue of provisions of Angolan law that require that payment for a  portion of the services provided by Sonatide be paid in Angolan kwanza; and (iii) optimizing opportunities, consistent with Angolan law, for services provided by us to be paid for directly in U.S. dollars.
 
Refer to Note (7) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the Sonatide joint venture. 
 International Labour Organization’s Maritime Labour Convention 
 
The International Labour Organization's Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (the "Convention") mandates globally, among other things, seafarer living and working conditions (accommodations, wages, conditions of employment, health and other benefits) aboard ships that are engaged in commercial activities.  Since its initial entry into force on August 20, 2013, 90 countries have now ratified the Convention.
 
We maintain certification of our vessels to Convention requirements based on the dates of enforcement by countries in which we operate, perform maintenance and repairs at shipyards, or make port calls during ocean voyages. Additionally, where possible, we continue to work with identified flag states to seek substantial equivalencies to comparable national and industry laws that meet the intent of the Convention and allow us to standardize operational protocols among our fleet.
 Government Regulation 
 We are subject to various United States federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the ownership, operation and maintenance of our vessels. Our U.S. flagged vessels are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Coast Guard, the United States Customs and Border Protection, and the United States Maritime Administration. We are also subject to international laws and conventions and the laws of international jurisdictions where we operate. 
 Under the citizenship provisions of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 and the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the “Jones Act”), we would not be permitted to engage in the U.S. coastwise trade if more than 25% of our outstanding stock were owned by non-U.S. citizens as defined by the Jones Act. For a company engaged in the U.S. coastwise trade to be deemed a U.S. citizen: (i) we must be organized under the laws of the United States or of a state, territory or possession thereof, (ii) each of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the Board of Directors of such corporation must be a U.S. citizen, (iii) no more than a minority of the number of directors of such corporation necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business can be non-U.S. citizens and (iv) at 
 9
 

least 75% of the interest in such company must be owned by U.S. citizens. We have a dual stock certificate system to protect against non-U.S. citizens owning more than 25% of our common stock. In addition, our charter provides us with certain remedies with respect to any transfer or purported transfer of shares of our common stock that would result in the ownership by non-U.S. citizens of more than 24% of our common stock. At the time of our emergence from bankruptcy on July 31, 2017, approximately 22% of our outstanding common stock was owned by non-US citizens. Based on information supplied to us by our transfer agent, less than 24% of our outstanding common stock was owned by non-U.S. citizens as of December 31, 2018. 
 
Our vessel operations in the U.S. GOM are considered to be coastwise trade. United States law requires that vessels engaged in the U.S. coastwise trade must be built in the U.S. and registered under U.S. flag. In addition, once a U.S. built vessel is registered under a non-U.S. flag, it cannot thereafter engage in U.S. coastwise trade. Therefore, our non-U.S. flagged vessels must operate outside of the U.S. coastwise trade zone. Of the total 257 vessels that we owned or operated at December 31, 2018, 225 vessels were registered under flags other than the United States and 32 vessels were registered under the U.S. flag. 
 All of our offshore vessels are subject to either United States or international safety and classification standards or sometimes both. U.S. flagged deepwater PSVs, deepwater AHTS vessels, towing-supply vessels, and crewboats are required to undergo periodic inspections generally twice within every five year period pursuant to U.S. Coast Guard regulations. Vessels registered under flags other than the United States are subject to similar regulations and are governed by the laws of the applicable international jurisdictions and the rules and requirements of various classification societies, such as the American Bureau of Shipping. 
 We are in compliance with the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, an amendment to the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention (1974/1988), and further mandated in the Maritime Transportation and Security Act of 2002 to align United States regulations with those of SOLAS and the ISPS Code. Under the ISPS Code, we perform worldwide security assessments, risk analyses, and develops vessel and required port facility security plans to enhance safe and secure vessel and facility operations. Additionally, we have developed security annexes for those U.S. flag vessels that transit or work in waters designated as high risk by the United States Coast Guard pursuant to the latest revision of Marsec Directive 104-6. 
 Environmental Compliance 
 During the ordinary course of business, our operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters. Violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties, fines, injunctions and other sanctions. Compliance with the existing governmental regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had, nor is expected to have, a material effect on us. Environmental laws and regulations are subject to change, however, and may impose increasingly strict requirements, and, as such, we cannot estimate the ultimate cost of complying with such potential changes to environmental laws and regulations. 
 We are also involved in various legal proceedings that relate to asbestos and other environmental matters. The amount of ultimate liability, if any, with respect to these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We are proactive in establishing policies and operating procedures for safeguarding the environment against any hazardous materials aboard our vessels and at shore-based locations. 
 Whenever possible, hazardous materials are maintained or transferred in confined areas in an attempt to ensure containment, if accidents were to occur. In addition, we have established operating policies that are intended to increase awareness of actions that may harm the environment. 

10
 

Safety 
 We are dedicated to ensuring the safety of our operations for our employees, our customers and any personnel associated with our operations. Tidewater’s principal operations occur in offshore waters where the workplace environment presents many safety challenges. Management communicates frequently with company personnel to promote safety and instill safe work habits through the use of company media directed at, and regular training of, both our seamen and shore-based personnel. Personnel and resources are dedicated to ensure safe operations and regulatory compliance. Our Director of Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSES) Management is involved in numerous proactive efforts to prevent accidents and injuries from occurring. The HSES Director also reviews all incidents that occur, focusing on lessons that can be learned from such incidents and opportunities to incorporate such lessons into our on-going safety-related training. In addition, we employ safety personnel to be responsible for administering our safety programs and fostering our safety culture. Our position is that each of our employees is a safety supervisor, who has the authority and the obligation to stop any operation that they deem to be unsafe. 
Risk Management 
 The operation of any marine vessel involves an inherent risk of marine losses (including physical damage to the vessel) attributable to adverse sea and weather conditions, mechanical failure, and collisions. In addition, the nature of our operations exposes us to the potential risks of damage to and loss of drilling rigs and production facilities, hostile activities attributable to war, sabotage, piracy and terrorism, as well as business interruption due to political action or inaction, including nationalization of assets by foreign governments. Any such event may lead to a reduction in revenues or increased costs. Our vessels are generally insured for their estimated market value against damage or loss, including war, acts of terrorism, and pollution risks, but we do not directly or fully insure for business interruption. We also carry workers’ compensation, maritime employer’s liability, director and officer liability, general liability (including third party pollution) and other insurance customary in the industry. 
 We seek to secure appropriate insurance coverage at competitive rates, in part, by maintaining self-insurance up to certain individual and aggregate loss limits. We carefully monitor claims and actively participate in claims estimates and adjustments. Estimated costs of self-insured claims, which include estimates for incurred but unreported claims, are accrued as liabilities on our balance sheet. 
 The continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have significantly increased the risk of political, economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate. It is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the United States domestically or abroad, and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of U.S. headquartered companies such as ours. The resulting economic, political and social uncertainties, including the potential for future terrorist acts and war, could cause the premiums charged for the insurance coverage to increase. We currently maintain war risk coverage on our entire fleet. 
 We believe that our insurance coverage is adequate. We have not experienced a loss in excess of insurance policy limits; however, there is no assurance that our liability coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise. While we believe that we should be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates considered commercially acceptable, we cannot guarantee that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially acceptable rates given the markets in which we operate. For further discussion of our risks see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Seasonality 
 Our global vessel fleet generally has its highest utilization rates in the warmer months when the weather is more favorable for offshore exploration, field development and construction work. Hurricanes, cyclones, the monsoon season, and other severe weather can negatively or positively impact vessel operations. In particular, our U.S. GOM operations can be impacted by the Atlantic hurricane season from the months of June through November, when offshore exploration, field development and construction work tends to slow or halt in an effort to mitigate potential losses and damage that may occur to the offshore oil and gas infrastructure should a hurricane enter the area. However, demand for offshore marine vessels typically increases in the U.S. GOM in connection with repair and remediation work that follows any hurricane damage to offshore crude oil and natural gas infrastructure. Our vessels that operate offshore India in Southeast Asia and in the Western Pacific are impacted by the monsoon season, which occurs across the region from November to April. Vessels that operate in the North Sea can be impacted by a seasonal slowdown in the winter months, generally from November to March. Although hurricanes, cyclones, monsoons and other severe weather can have a seasonal impact on operations, our business volume is more dependent on crude oil and natural gas pricing, global supply of crude oil and natural gas, and demand for our offshore support vessels and other services than on any seasonal variation.

Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 5,500 employees worldwide, which includes approximately 880 employees added in connection with the business combination with GulfMark. We are not a party to any union contract in the United States but through several subsidiaries are subject to union agreements covering local nationals in several countries other than the United States. In the past, we have been the subject of a union organizing campaign for the U.S. GOM employees by maritime labor unions. If the employees in the U.S. GOM were to unionize, our flexibility in managing industry changes in the domestic market could be adversely affected.
