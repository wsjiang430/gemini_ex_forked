 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 Our mission is to transform ophthalmology and optometry through the development and commercialization of proprietary devices that target the underlying causes of the world’s most prevalent eye diseases. We are passionate about improving patients’ lives. Our business philosophy is grounded in the following principles: comprehensively understanding disease physiology; developing products that are intended to restore natural physiological functionality to diseased eyes; developing and marketing products that achieve superior effectiveness versus current treatment paradigms while minimizing complications or side effects; providing intuitive, patient friendly solutions to ophthalmologists and optometrists (together, "eyecare professionals" or "ECPs"); and delivering compelling economic value to all stakeholders, including patients, providers and third-party payors such as Medicare and commercial insurers. Our objective is to develop and market products for use in new treatment paradigms and to create an interventional mindset in eyecare whereby our products may be used in procedures which supplant conventional outdated approaches. We believe current eyecare treatment models rely heavily on prescription medications, symptom relief, or either flawed or highly invasive, later-stage procedural interventions, and often fail to adequately address the true underlying cause of disease.
 We have focused our initial product development efforts on the treatment of two of the world’s most prevalent and underserved eye diseases, glaucoma and dry eye disease ("DED"). We estimate the annual addressable U.S. market opportunities for the products in our surgical glaucoma ("Surgical Glaucoma") and dry eye ("Dry Eye") segments are approximately $6 billion and approximately $10 billion, respectively, while 2022 U.S. manufacturer revenues in the surgical glaucoma and DED markets were approximately $466 million and $2.1 billion, respectively, demonstrating that currently available solutions have not addressed a large part of the market need.
 Glaucoma, a group of chronic, often asymptomatic, diseases that damage the optic nerve, is the world’s leading cause of irreversible blindness. Glaucoma does not have a cure and is a progressive disease; if left untreated or insufficiently treated, glaucoma can lead to irreversible disability and blindness. An estimated 149 million people worldwide suffer from glaucoma. Primary open-angle glaucoma ("POAG"), is the most prevalent form of glaucoma and affects over 60 million people worldwide, including approximately 4.3 million people in the United States, of whom an estimated 3.4 million have been diagnosed. One of the greatest risk factors for POAG, and the only risk factor that can be controlled, is elevated intraocular pressure ("IOP"). Elevated IOP is often caused by malfunctioning drainage pathways in the eye that provide abnormal resistance to the outflow of aqueous humor, a clear, watery fluid which bathes and nourishes the lens and maintains pressure within the eye.
 We currently have two commercial products in our Surgical Glaucoma segment. OMNI is a handheld, single use, therapeutic device that allows ophthalmic surgeons to reduce IOP in adult glaucoma patients. SION is a bladeless, manually operated device used in ophthalmic surgical procedures to excise trabecular meshwork, which is the tissue located near the cornea through which aqueous humor, or fluid, flows out of the eye.
OMNI allows the ophthalmic surgeon to sequentially complete two distinct, well-established but historically invasive ab externo glaucoma procedures, canaloplasty and trabeculotomy, in an efficient, minimally invasive manner using a single, bloodless and sutureless clear corneal microincision. Microinvasive glaucoma surgery ("MIGS") procedures have a strong demonstrated safety profile, characterized by minimal trauma to the eye and quick patient recovery times. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") has cleared the use of OMNI for reducing IOP in all adult POAG patients both by itself on a standalone basis ("Standalone procedures"), or in combination with cataract surgery ("Combination Cataract procedures"). Several competing MIGS devices, including the current market leaders, have only been cleared or approved by the FDA for use in Combination Cataract procedures for adult patients with mild-to-moderate severity. We estimate that over 85% of the U.S. addressable market opportunity for POAG cannot be served with Combination Cataract procedures because less than 15% of POAG patients receive cataract surgery in any given year.
 We believe that OMNI delivers the highest level of effectiveness of any available MIGS product, as it is the only device that provides access to 360 degrees of the diseased conventional outflow pathway through a clear corneal incision to address all three primary points of resistance in the conventional outflow pathway (trabecular meshwork, Schlemm’s canal, and the distal collector channels).

OMNI’s indication for use was cleared by the FDA in March 2021 based upon the review of clinical data from ROMEO, our U.S. multi-center clinical study of OMNI in Combination Cataract and Standalone procedures. OMNI has received 510(k) clearance from the FDA and a CE mark to be marketed in the U.S. and the European Union ("EU") respectively, for canaloplasty (microcatheterization and transluminal viscodilation of Schlemm’s canal) followed by trabeculotomy (cutting of trabecular meshwork) to reduce IOP in adult patients with POAG in the U.S. or with open-angle glaucoma ("OAG") in the EU. OMNI is cleared by the FDA to lower IOP in both Combination Cataract and Standalone cases for all adults with POAG. We are pursuing an FDA Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE"), that would authorize us to conduct a clinical study, which we refer to as PRECISION, to assess the safety and effectiveness of a new, higher volume investigational OMNI device to perform canaloplasty alone to lower IOP in adults with POAG. We are intending to conduct this canaloplasty-alone IDE trial to support a premarket notification to the FDA seeking clearance for use to perform canaloplasty-alone procedures in adults with POAG.
 We introduced SION in the third quarter of 2022. SION is registered with the FDA as a Class I 510(k) exempt device. SION’s bladeless design, micro-engineered and precision manufactured using specialized lasers, excises tissue without cutting. SION grasps and removes diseased tissue as the surgeon sweeps the instrument around Schlemm’s canal with a single smooth motion. The bladeless technology of SION was developed with leading ophthalmic surgeons to improve safety and ease of use by eliminating the need to navigate sharp instrumentation within the eye’s anterior chamber and iridocorneal angle anatomy. We believe SION represents our third consecutive best-in-category device and satisfies the American Academy of Ophthalmology definition of goniotomy.
SION allows us to serve specific subsets of customers who may prioritize a faster or simpler procedure. Our target customers for SION include three types of combination cataract MIGS surgeons that are distinct from target OMNI customers: 1) high volume cataract surgeons seeking to perform the quickest MIGS procedures, 2) surgeons who are initially less experienced with MIGS such as surgical fellows at academic institutions and 3) surgeons looking for the most cost effective MIGS procedures in facilities that may emphasize procedural profitability. We believe that these use cases have very little overlap with the use cases for our OMNI device.
Our goal is to establish OMNI and SION as the standards of care for POAG patients and goniotomy patients, respectively, by continuing to grow their adoption and utilization in the existing Combination Cataract market segment, which we believe remains underpenetrated and estimate is capturing less than one-third of its current potential procedural volume. We believe training ophthalmic surgeons to use OMNI will help us pioneer the development of the Standalone market segment (over 85% of the potential U.S. POAG market). We believe the consistent therapeutic outcomes OMNI delivers are important for patients and surgeons alike, especially those considering a Standalone MIGS procedure.
We primarily sell OMNI and SION in the U.S. through our dedicated Surgical Glaucoma sales team. Our commercial strategy for OMNI centers on building confidence and conviction among the glaucoma community through continued execution of our clinical trials and publication of their results in peer-reviewed journals. The procedure enabled by OMNI, canaloplasty followed by trabeculotomy, is covered and reimbursed by all Medicare Administrative Contractors ("MACs") and numerous private insurers, covering an estimated 74% of medical benefit covered lives in the U.S. Designed for use in well-established clinical procedures, and with advantages that have been observed to promote safe, effective and highly consistent clinical outcomes, we believe that OMNI has the potential to establish a more proactive, interventional paradigm for IOP reduction in POAG. Our Surgical Glaucoma segment, which includes OMNI and SION, represented 92% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022.
 We currently have one commercial product in our Dry Eye segment. TearCare is a unique open-eye heating and expression device designed to melt and remove meibomian gland obstructions. We believe TearCare has a compelling physiological profile to address obstruction from meibomian gland disease ("MGD") which is the primary cause of evaporative DED, a disease characterized by low quality tears that evaporate prematurely. Dry eye complaints are the most common reason for a patient visit to an eye doctor. There are an estimated 757 million people globally who suffer from DED. DED is the most common reason for a patient visit to an eye doctor, yet of the 38 million people with DED in the U.S., only an estimated 17 million have been diagnosed with DED. Dry eye symptoms have a significant impact on the quality of life and productivity of patients suffering from DED. If left untreated, DED can be extremely painful, leading to permanent cornea damage and vision impairment.
 Studies have shown that evaporative DED resulting from MGD is associated with approximately 86% of all DED cases. In healthy eyes, there are 25-30 meibomian glands located within each of the upper and lower eyelids. These glands

produce and secrete an oily substance called meibum which forms the outer layer of healthy tears, which is also known as the lipid layer. Meibum normally has an olive oil-like consistency and contributes a vital element of the tear film that prevents premature tear evaporation. In patients with MGD, meibum hardens within the glands causing obstructions that can partially or completely block the oily secretions from reaching the tear film. The resulting compromised outer surface of the tear leads to accelerated tear evaporation and DED. Third-party clinical studies have also demonstrated that treating MGD by liquefying and removing clogged meibum is the most effective method of eliminating obstructions and restoring a healthy tear film lipid layer, thereby preventing premature evaporation of tears.
 Our TearCare System is designed to enable ECPs to heat and liquefy meibomian gland blockages, followed promptly by manual, comprehensive clearing of these blockages with a separate clearance tool. We developed TearCare to serve as an elegant, compact, portable, and intuitive solution comprised of the SmartHub ("SmartHub"), a reusable hardware controller, and the TearCare SmartLids® ("SmartLids"), a breakthrough, wearable, single-use software-controlled eyelid technology. Applied adhesively and non-invasively to the outside of the eyelids, single-use SmartLids deliver a precise therapeutic level of heat into the meibomian glands. Engineering SmartLids to remain comfortably adhered to virtually all shapes and sizes of eyelids while allowing freedom to blink and delivering precise therapeutic heat is one of our most significant design accomplishments. This heating process follows clinically proven guidelines for temperature and duration required to melt obstructions in the glands and restore the production and secretion of healthy, clear meibum onto the tear surface. The proprietary, highly conformant, open-eye design of TearCare allows patients to blink naturally throughout the thermal portion of the procedure, which provides a comfortable patient experience. TearCare can be utilized by an ECP in a straightforward in-office procedure and can be accommodated during the course of a routine patient visit. Additionally, TearCare does not require a large capital equipment investment by ECPs, and we believe that it offers an attractive economic value proposition to providers, patients and third- party payors.
 In OLYMPIA, our large multi-center, randomized control trial ("RCT"), the TearCare procedure was associated with statistically significant clinical improvements in all assessed signs and symptoms of DED. This included tear breakup time ("TBUT"), and meibomian gland secretion score ("MGSS"), objective measurements of DED that were the trial’s primary endpoints, as well as patient-reported symptoms surveys, including Ehlers Danlos syndrome ("EDS"), ocular surface disease index ("OSDI"), and symptom assessment in dry eye ("SANDE"), at all time periods measured (both two weeks and four weeks post-treatment).
We believe the MGD market requires additional ECP and patient education, including clinical data to differentiate procedural and product alternatives, and enhanced patient access through the potential advancement of reimbursement coverage. Our goals with the development of TearCare are to fully transform the current outdated treatment paradigm based primarily on over-the-counter, or OTC, and prescription eyedrops which do not address obstruction of the meibomian glands, the primary root cause of MGD, and establish use of TearCare as the standard of care for the millions of patients suffering from evaporative DED caused by MGD.
 In December 2021, the FDA cleared TearCare for the application of localized heat therapy in adult patients with evaporative DED due to MGD, when used in conjunction with manual expression of the meibomian glands.
We focus on continuous innovation and seek regular input from our network of expert employees (including several ophthalmologists on staff), advisors and customers to rapidly iterate our pre- and post-commercial product designs with the aim of better satisfying the needs of our customers and their patients, and increasing adoption and utilization of our solutions.
Our ability to continuously and rapidly innovate our products is a core competency of our company. Our product innovation has resulted in a comprehensive portfolio of 37 issued U.S. patents, 48 issued patents outside of the U.S. (including five issued European patents and their national validations), 19 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, 19 pending foreign patent applications and two pending Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications as of December 31, 2022.
 The overall success of our innovative approach to eyecare to date is evidenced by the over 150,000 estimated uses of OMNI and its direct predicates in over 1,600 hospitals and ambulatory service centers ("ASCs") in the U.S. and EU, and over 25,000 estimated uses of TearCare in over 1,000 eyecare facilities in the U.S. through December 31, 2022.


Our Solutions
 We have designed OMNI, SION, and TearCare to be interventional ophthalmology devices. We believe that both glaucoma and DED are significantly underserved by current treatment offerings and that there are large market opportunities for effective solutions that restore the natural functionality of diseased eyes.
Our Product Development Approach
 The past, current, and ongoing development of OMNI, SION, and TearCare follows our internal product development approach, which is governed by four fundamental requirements that we believe are critical to delivering the most effective, safe and consistent clinical outcomes for patients with eye disease.
 •Comprehensive Understanding of Disease Physiology
 •Treatment of Underlying Causes
 •Intuitive Design
 •Patient Access
 We aim and expect to be a clinical leader in every eyecare segment we enter and seek to achieve all four criteria in all of our product development projects. From device ideation to commercialization, we take into consideration the perspectives of patients, providers and third-party payors throughout our product development process. When possible, we seek to streamline our product commercialization process by judiciously designing our products to achieve the most efficient routes for FDA clearance or authorization for each applicable indication and reimbursement coverage by third-party payors.
OMNI Surgical System
 OMNI is a handheld, single use, therapeutic device for MIGS. OMNI is designed to restore the eye’s natural drainage system without compromising the structural integrity of the eye or leaving implants behind post-surgery.
We believe that OMNI is the first and only multi-procedure MIGS device dually indicated for canaloplasty followed by trabeculotomy. Canaloplasty primarily addresses distal resistance (i.e., collapsed Schlemm’s canal, blocked collector channel ostia) and has some presumed effects on the inner wall of Schlemm’s canal and the trabecular meshwork due to dilation and stretching. In a trabeculotomy procedure, a surgeon unroofs Schlemm’s canal by cutting the trabecular meshwork to provide aqueous humor with direct access to the drainage points in the conventional outflow pathway. Trabeculotomy addresses proximal resistance, which is the outflow resistance in the trabecular meshwork and inner wall of Schlemm’s canal. We believe that the sequential combination of canaloplasty followed by trabeculotomy is uniquely capable of treating all three primary points of resistance in the conventional outflow pathway of the eye. We believe treating all three primary points of resistance is critical to achieving the consistency and level of effectiveness in reducing IOP and medication requirements necessary to expand the use case for MIGS procedures to the Standalone market and to all disease severities among adult POAG patients.
 We have applied our medical expertise, as well as specialized design and engineering capabilities, to create a complex device that is simple in appearance and intuitive to use. Each OMNI device consists of 29 separate precision-engineered parts that have been optimized for performance, effectiveness and usability. After inserting the cannula tip into the corneal microincision and accessing Schlemm’s canal, the surgeon can advance and retract the catheter with a fingertip dial up to 180 degrees. Upon retraction of the catheter, OMNI delivers viscoelastic fluid to complete the viscodilation of the relevant portion of Schlemm’s canal. The surgeon can complete a full 360 degree canaloplasty by reinserting the catheter and advancing it in the opposite direction. To perform the trabeculotomy following the canaloplasty, the same microcatheter can be reinserted into Schlemm’s canal and used to deroof the trabecular meshwork in a titratable manner (90, 180, 270 or 360 degrees). OMNI’s versatility and titratable functionality, which we believe is unmatched by other MIGS products currently on the market, enables surgeons to perform sequential comprehensive outflow treatments that they can customize based on an individual patient’s disease severity and eye anatomy in both Combination Cataract and Standalone settings.
 

SION Surgical Instrument
 We introduced SION in the third quarter of 2022. SION’s bladeless design, micro-engineered and precision manufactured using specialized lasers, excises tissue without cutting. SION grasps and removes diseased tissue as the surgeon sweeps the instrument around Schlemm’s canal with a single smooth motion. The bladeless technology of SION was developed with leading ophthalmic surgeons to improve safety and ease of use by eliminating the need to navigate sharp instrumentation within the eye’s anterior chamber and iridocorneal angle anatomy. We believe SION represents our third consecutive best-in-category device and satisfies the American Academy of Ophthalmology definition of goniotomy.
TearCare System
 In an effort to address the treatment of evaporative DED due to MGD, we custom designed TearCare to facilitate what we believe is the optimal method for clearing meibomian gland obstructions based on numerous clinical studies: warming the glands to a minimum of 41 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes to melt congealed meibum followed by manual, clinician customized and performed removal of the liquefied obstructions using forceps to help facilitate restoration of healthy meibum production to naturally fortify the tear’s protective lipid layer. The goal of TearCare treatments is to restore the eyelid’s natural ability to produce healthy lipid secretions and recover the integrity of the tear film.
Our TearCare System includes a pair of single-use SmartLids, the first wearable, highly conformant, precision heating device for the eyelids. SmartLids allow for eyes to be open and blink during the thermal portion of the process and are software-controlled, delivering precise heat to the tarsal plates of the eyelids directly overlying the meibomian glands while continuously monitoring temperature and communicating 144 times per second with the SmartHub, a compact, finely calibrated power source and control unit which can make instantaneous adjustments to ensure delivery of the desired amount of heat and therapeutic temperature level. Engineering SmartLids to remain comfortably adhered to virtually all shapes and sizes of eyelids while allowing freedom to blink and delivering precise therapeutic heat is one of our most significant design accomplishments. Following therapeutic heat application by TearCare, ECPs may use forceps to manually express melted meibum from each gland. ECPs can tailor the amount of pressure applied during expression to specific glands based on a desired full evacuation of the glands, thereby allowing the eyelids to resume the production and secretion of meibum to coat and protect tears.
 According to patient and ECP feedback, treatments using TearCare are comfortable for patients since they can keep their eyes open during the thermal portion of the procedure and have the freedom to blink naturally. Additionally, TearCare was designed to be administered during the course of a routine office visit to an ECP, which makes it convenient for patients, and allows providers to maintain procedural throughput in their practices. We believe that these features of the patient and ECP experience with TearCare procedures offer a stark contrast to other available alternatives which we believe are burdened by ineffective and suboptimal product design, including awkward and uncomfortable patient experiences through closed eye solutions and/or manual solutions that require extremely close patient proximity to the ECP throughout the treatment.
 Our Success Factors
 Our mission is to transform eyecare by developing products that address the underlying causes of the world’s most prevalent eye diseases. We design our products to enable ECPs to perform safe and effective interventional procedures that can transform treatment paradigms. We believe the following success factors will drive the growth of our company:
 •Large market opportunities in eyecare with flawed treatment paradigms 
 •Continual development of innovative technologies
 •Consistent delivery of exceptional customer experience
 •Prioritization of clinical excellence and market education
 •Focus on compelling economics and value creation for all eyecare stakeholders
 •Scale culture built on community, passion, courage, integrity and perseverance
 

Our Growth Strategy
 The fundamental objectives of our growth strategy are to establish robust clinical data to support the development of our target markets and the continued commercialization of our products and to deliver an exceptional customer experience to the ECPs and patients who utilize our products. Our current growth strategies include:
 •Establish OMNI and SION as the standards of care for interventional glaucoma treatment among MIGS-trained surgeons
 •Pioneer the Standalone MIGS segment with OMNI
 •Develop the MGD treatment market through a patient access-led strategy
 •Drive adoption and utilization of our products by leveraging additional clinical trials and market education
 •Deepen and broaden our commercial capabilities and expertise
 •Expand into international markets
 •Continuously innovate premium product offerings throughout eyecare
 •Obtain and maintain appropriate reimbursement coverage by governmental and commercial payors
 Clinical Data
 We believe that treatment decisions should be evidence-based and hold ourselves to the highest clinical and ethical standards to build and maintain credibility in the medical community. We are deeply committed to conducting studies to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and durability of treatments using our products, and subjecting the results to the rigorous peer review process for publication in leading journals. Our robust and growing libraries of evidence to support OMNI, SION and TearCare are helping to drive their awareness and adoption, and ultimately advancing patient care in ophthalmology and optometry.
 We are currently conducting active and robust clinical trial programs in both POAG and MGD. Our clinical trial designs include both RCTs, prospective, and retrospective real-world studies, based on our belief that each of these approaches has unique strengths. We also plan to continue supporting our investigator-initiated trial program.
 OMNI Surgical System
 OMNI Clinical Program Overview
 Building on a solid foundation of completed and ongoing clinical trials, we are investing significant resources to further develop clinical data regarding the use of OMNI. Since 2018, there have been 21 articles published in peer-reviewed journals for OMNI and its Sight Sciences predicate devices and procedures. Our completed trials include ROMEO, GEMINI, and TREY. ROMEO was used to support OMNI’s indication for use expansion in the U.S. in March 2021 and resulted in two published articles in peer-reviewed journals. GEMINI was a prospective, multi-center, historical control, single-arm, U.S. study. TREY was a multi-center study evaluating the effectiveness of Standalone intervention using OMNI in eyes with uncontrolled IOP previously treated with trabecular bypass canal implants.

TearCare System
 TearCare Clinical Program Overview
 We designed TearCare to comprehensively address MGD, which we believe to be the primary underlying cause of evaporative DED. We have developed robust clinical data evaluating TearCare. We have completed one RCT for TearCare ("OLYMPIA") and we completed enrolling patients in our SAHARA RCT ("SAHARA") in the third quarter of 2022. Data from OLYMPIA supported the FDA clearance of TearCare’s expanded indication for use in December 2021. We plan to leverage the results of our OLYMPIA and SAHARA studies to support FDA clearances to further expand indications for use of TearCare and to support our patient access strategy.

Commercial Approach
 We have built a world-class direct sales commercial organization that features professionals and executives with substantial leadership experience from leading ophthalmic product companies. In particular, we have recruited professionals with track records that include launching new technologies, growing primary demand, changing treatment paradigms and securing market access from payors. We believe this expertise is crucial to achieve our market development objectives for interventional Standalone MIGS and MGD treatment. Sales representatives typically have relevant experience across all facets of medical device and/or pharmaceutical sales focused on eyecare to ensure the development of a trusted consultative relationship with our ECPs. As we have continued to develop additional clinical data and brand recognition, we believe our team has differentiated our product offerings and gained commercial traction through exceptional, highly involved training, support and ongoing professional education. As of December 31, 2022, our overall commercial team consisted of over 150 professionals dedicated to sales, marketing, commercial support, training and professional relations.
 We created distinct sales, marketing, and training teams for each of our business units because their products are predominantly sold to different types of customers and require specialized product specific sales expertise and ECP training to integrate our products into their practices. We sell OMNI and SION to facilities where ophthalmic surgeons perform outpatient procedures, mainly ASCs and hospital outpatient departments ("HOPDs"). We sell TearCare to optometry and ophthalmology practices.
 Our marketing efforts are centered around increasing awareness of our products and presenting clinical study results through leading medical publications and at large industry and scientific meetings, both directly and through our advisors.

We have also partnered with qualified ECPs to speak to peers on our behalf through educational forums either in-person or via virtual meetings. Clinical data that demonstrate the benefits of OMNI and TearCare for their authorized uses will continue to underpin our commercial efforts and we will continue to devote significant resources to conduct new clinical studies and publish articles in peer-reviewed journals.
 Reimbursement
 There are three primary aspects of reimbursement in the United States: coding, coverage and payment. Each aspect is an important determinant of our customers’ ability to obtain appropriate reimbursement.
 •Coding refers to the availability of billing codes for use by healthcare providers to report the provision of medical procedures, and the use of supplies and resources for specific patients, to insurance providers and organizations that make payments for healthcare, commonly referred to as third-party payors. The Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System ("HCPCS"), is a national, standardized code set used by providers to capture and report healthcare services and products. This code set consists of two subsystems: Level I CPT codes, representing procedures performed, and Level II, commonly referred to as HCPCS codes, representing healthcare products (e.g. devices, drugs, durable medical equipment), supplies and services not captured in the CPT code set. CPT codes are published by the American Medical Association ("AMA"), and are used to report medical services and procedures performed in the outpatient setting of care by or under the direction of physicians. HCPCS codes are established and maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") and identify items used in the course of care delivery. Health plans pay outpatient facilities and physicians for services based on submission of a claim using one or more CPT and/or HCPCS codes. CPT codes fall into one of three categories.
 •Category I CPT codes have been approved by the AMA as permanent procedure codes based on a number of factors, including the level of published clinical evidence. They are identified with a five-digit number and official code description. Approved Category I CPT codes have typically been endorsed by relevant medical specialty societies, are consistent with contemporary medical practice, and represent procedures performed by many physicians in clinical practice in multiple locations. Category I codes are only available to procedures for which the technology (e.g., device, drug, test) has been FDA approved/cleared when such a regulatory requirement exists.
 •Category II CPT codes are supplemental tracking codes used for performance measurement. They are intended to facilitate data collection about quality of care by coding certain services and/or test results that support performance measures and that have been agreed upon as contributing to good patient care. Some codes in this category may relate to compliance by health care professionals with state or federal law.
 •Category III CPT codes are a temporary set of tracking codes for new and emerging technologies, and generally are not initially covered and reimbursed by payors, though coverage and reimbursement may subsequently follow. These codes are designed to facilitate data collection for the assessment of new procedures. Additionally, Category III codes provide a mechanism for payors to value a new procedure. Temporary codes are not automatically assigned Relative Value Units ("RVUs") or weights and, therefore, do not typically have a widely accepted payment rate methodology. To achieve Category III status, a new procedure is required to have either an approved protocol for a study of procedures being performed, support from the specialties that would use the procedure, availability of US peer-reviewed literature, or current clinical trials that outline the effectiveness of the procedure. Once granted, Category III CPT codes expire five years after the initial application was approved, although they can be extended beyond the five-year limit.
 •Level II HCPCS codes are alpha-numeric codes governed by CMS that identify medical products and items or services that are not appropriately designated by another code set (e.g., CPT). Criteria must be met in order to qualify for an HCPCS code, including such requirements as regulatory approval (if necessary), national programmatic need, and a distinct difference from existing HCPCS codes.
 •Coverage refers to decisions made by third-party payors as to whether there is sufficient published clinical evidence to support medical necessity, or to consider a healthcare item or service “reasonable and 


necessary” (as per Medicare guidelines). Coverage can be established by explicit medical policies that outline specific parameters covering procedures and/or technologies, and under what conditions coverage is permitted, including specific diagnoses, clinical indications and therapeutic prerequisites. Coverage can also be implicit, as when payors are “silent” on a procedure or technology (i.e., no formal policy is developed). In the absence of formal policy, coverage may be granted one of two ways: (1) with no required review, as with long-standing established healthcare items or services, or (2) on a case-by-case basis via review of each patient’s circumstance, as may be the case with newer procedures/technologies. Each payor can make its own decision as to which procedures or technologies warrant formal policy coverage.
 •Payment refers to the reimbursement rate for a healthcare item or service. The amount paid by third- party payors to providers, including facilities and doctors, for specific procedures and items (e.g., medical devices, drugs, ancillary supplies) is determined by each payor. Payments for professional services under CPT coding are generally determined by the RVUs of a specific billing code. These RVUs identify the time and intensity of the work required, the practice expense incurred and the level of risk related to the procedure. Payors can use their organization-specific formula or conversion factor to translate RVUs into payment rates, or may establish payment by reference to a national Medicare payment amount. Likewise, facility payments are weighted based on the resources (e.g., operating suite time, devices and supplies) needed for the procedure to be performed in the facility setting. Most payment rates are geographically adjusted, taking into account the cost of providing services in different wage index areas across the country. As with procedure payments, payments for healthcare items (e.g., products reported using HCPCS coding) are determined by individual health plans, often based on some form of manufacturer’s invoice or billed charges based on the provider’s mark-up methodology, or based on established fee schedule rates. It is important to recognize that not all reportable codes are separately payable. Some codes are bundled with related items or services and do not have a separate payment allowance.
 Our commercial activities are substantially within the United States. We sell our Surgical Glaucoma products primarily to ASCs and HOPDs, who in turn bill various third-party payors, such as Medicare and private health insurance plans for the healthcare services and resources rendered to treat a patient. TearCare is not currently covered or paid by Medicare or private payors under any formal policy, although some payors may agree to provide case-based coverage outside of a formal policy. Our market access team facilitates patient access to the OMNI, SION and TearCare systems by engaging payors on coverage, coding and payment matters, and by providing support to patients and our customers as they seek reimbursement from payors that do not have positive coverage or those that do not have formal policies in place regarding our products.
 Reimbursement for Uses of the OMNI Surgical System and SION Surgical Instrument
 Surgeons are able to use OMNI to sequentially perform two well-established glaucoma procedures, canaloplasty followed by trabeculotomy.
 Canaloplasty and goniotomy are covered by the Medicare Administrative Contractors ("MACs"), outside of a formal coverage policy. Widespread coverage is important for commercial adoption. Based on POAG prevalence, we estimate that currently over 60% of patients who receive glaucoma treatment using OMNI are covered by Medicare, and that this percentage may decline modestly over time as usage of OMNI expands to include patients with a broader range of OAG progression. Private payor coverage policies vary for canaloplasty and for goniotomy. In the United States, some commercial payors, including numerous Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, have published medical policies that consider canaloplasty medically necessary for the treatment of glaucoma, though specific criteria for coverage may vary depending on the payor. Additionally, as with many healthcare items and services, some health plans cover the procedures performed using OMNI and SION outside of a formal coverage policy. Where coverage is less consistent or is limited, as is the case with certain commercial payors, our market access team works with payors directly and with customers to facilitate patient access to our Surgical Glaucoma products by working towards securing appropriate coverage and reimbursement. We have established and continue to build a substantial library of clinical trial and health economics outcomes research ("HEOR") data and published articles to directly address the needs of payors. We believe that the results from our completed, in-progress and planned clinical trials and subsequent accompanying peer-reviewed articles will help to expand and solidify coverage of canaloplasty and goniotomy and the use of OMNI and SION. We estimate that, as of December 31, 2022, approximately ­­­­­­74% of people with medical benefit coverage have reimbursed access to the canaloplasty procedures

and/or OMNI specifically under such coverage. In particular, we continue to proactively engage with the remaining key national and regional payors currently not covering canaloplasty and/or OMNI to seek reversals of their current non-coverage policies.
 Virtually all sales of OMNI and SION in the U.S. are to ASCs and HOPDs. Surgeons may use OMNI to perform canaloplasty and trabeculotomy sequentially, with CPT code 66174 used to report the procedure. Surgeons may use SION to perform goniotomy, using CPT code 65820, to report the procedure. Per Medicare and many private payor payment policies, when certain procedures are performed in the ASC setting, such as cataract surgery, canaloplasty and goniotomy, multiple procedure payment reduction rules apply. Therefore, when a canaloplasty or goniotomy is performed with cataract surgery on the same patient on the same day, payment of the lower-cost procedure (most commonly the cataract procedure) is reduced by 50%. Multiple procedure payment reduction rules also typically apply to professional services. Physicians are likely to be paid at a reduced rate for lower valued procedures when performed concomitantly. In the HOPD setting, Medicare procedures performed using OMNI and SION as well as cataract procedures, are paid under comprehensive ambulatory payment classifications ("C-APCs"). In these circumstances, the highest valued code is paid at 100%, with payment for additional procedures performed during the same operative session bundled into the single highest payment rate. Many commercial payers use a similar payment methodology, but payment rules can vary across health plans, particularly across plan types (e.g., HMO, PPO, POS).
 In the ASC setting, the 2023 Medicare national unadjusted average facility payment rate for CPT code 66174 and CPT code 65820 are $1,968.66. In the HOPD setting, the 2023 Medicare national unadjusted average facility payment rates for CPT code 66174 and CPT code 65820 are $3,995.58. These payments are classified as comprehensive C-APCs, therefore in the HOPD setting, the highest valued code will be paid and other C-APC classified procedures will be bundled into the highest paid procedure. Regardless of facility setting, the Medicare national unadjusted physician payment rates for CPT code 66174 and CPT code 65820 are $622.17 and $827.19, respectively. Based on customer feedback, we believe the rates for facility and physician reimbursement in both settings reflect attractive and reasonable payments to cover all of our customers’ costs and economic needs related to glaucoma treatments using OMNI and SION.
 While commercialization of OMNI has primarily been focused on the U.S., we have also begun international commercialization efforts. Outside the U.S., we have focused our efforts in the United Kingdom and Germany, where we have hired local commercial and market access teams to promote OMNI to health care professionals. Although Germany employs a single-payor health system and national MIGS procedure codes which include canaloplasty and trabeculotomy, coverage decisions are made on a decentralized basis by the Physician’s Associations (Kassenärztliche Vereinigung) ("KVs") in each of Germany's 17 regions. To date, canaloplasty and trabeculotomy procedures are covered in all 17 regions and we are working towards educating ECPs across all these regions regarding the appropriate procurement and submission of claims for reimbursement from the KVs to facilitate access to OMNI for patients and ECPs. In the United Kingdom, we are in the process of working to expand reimbursed access to OMNI procedures, and we believe that the National Health System’s tariffs, or payments, for MIGS procedures (including OMNI) will continue to be favorable. As we expand into other countries, we will establish payor coverage and reimbursement strategies that are appropriate for each local market.
Reimbursement for Uses of the TearCare System
 TearCare is not currently covered by Medicare or private payors via formal medical policy, although some payors may agree to provide coverage and payment outside of formal policy. In December 2021, the FDA cleared TearCare for the application of localized heat therapy in adult patients with evaporative dry eye disease due to meibomian gland dysfunction, when used in conjunction with manual expression of the meibomian glands. We believe that the current standard of care (representing over 95% of the existing market), which primarily consists of warm compresses, over-the-counter artificial tears, or lubricating eyedrops, and prescription eyedrops, does not treat the root cause of MGD. We believe TearCare has the potential to offer a better standard of care for evaporative dry eye patients and reduce overall costs for payors.
 Despite the presence of a large and growing patient-pay market for TearCare as shown in our controlled launch, we believe that improving access to TearCare through positive coverage decisions by Medicare and private payors will help grow the market for the TearCare procedures. We are pursuing a vigorous market access development plan to obtain more favorable policies from Medicare and private payors for procedures using TearCare in the U.S.


Category III CPT code 0563T, which became effective January 1, 2020, describes the heating of meibomian glands using a wearable open-eye device and manual evacuation of meibomian glands. This code allows providers to pursue reimbursement claims and payors to establish payment rates for the procedure. Prior to formal coverage decisions or a permanent Category I code, third-party payors may cover procedures billed with temporary Category III codes on a case-by-case basis.
 We continue to generate clinical data to support positive coverage decisions from Medicare and private payors. In September 2021, an article discussing results from our OLYMPIA RCT was published in Cornea. This randomized controlled trial compared treatment using TearCare to the leading alternative MGD treatment device on the market. In the study, we observed that a single use of TearCare was associated with improvement in each of the signs and symptoms of DED within two weeks of treatment in subjects with MGD. A subset analysis of patients in the OLYMPIA trial with advanced dry eye disease demonstrating superior symptoms improvements with TearCare compared to an alternative MGD treatment device was published in Clinical Ophthalmology (August 2022). Additionally, results from the CHEETAH study suggesting that a single TearCare procedure is safe and effective in treatment signs and symptoms of DED were published in Clinical Ophthalmology (December 2020).
Our comprehensive long-term strategy to improve patient access to TearCare includes the following key initiatives:
 •Demonstrate the effectiveness, safety and durability of TearCare with rigorous clinical data
•Augment library of published articles on TearCare
 •Support coverage applications
 •Convert to permanent Category I CPT code
 Competition
 We believe our focus on developing and marketing intuitively designed products that are intended to restore the eye’s natural physiological function by addressing underlying causes of eye disease will be an important factor in our future success. The medical device and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. We compete with medical device and pharmaceutical companies that develop and commercialize products for eye conditions. Notable competitors with approved MIGS products include Glaukos, Alcon/Ivantis and AbbVie/Allergan and New World Medical. Notable competitors with approved DED products include AbbVie/Allergan, Novartis, Johnson & Johnson, and Alcon. Some of our competitors are larger, well-capitalized companies with greater current market share and resources. We also compete with several smaller medical device companies that have single products or a limited range of products. Some of our competitors have:
 •Significantly greater name recognition;
 •Broader or deeper relations with healthcare professionals, customers, industry associations and third-party payors;
 •More established distribution networks;
 •Additional lines of products and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or other incentives to attract adoption;
 •Greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, marketing and obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for products; and
 •Greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing and patent and other intellectual property litigation.
 We compete primarily on the basis that our medical devices are able to treat patients with prevalent eye diseases safely and effectively. Our continued success depends on our ability to:
 •Develop innovative, proprietary technology and products that can cost-effectively address significant clinical needs;


•Obtain and maintain regulatory clearances or approvals for the use of our products;
 •Obtain and maintain favorable reimbursement decisions relating to the use of our products;
 •Demonstrate clinical safety and effectiveness in our sponsored and third-party trials and studies;
 •Attract and retain skilled research and development and sales personnel; and
 •Successfully market and sell products.
 Manufacturing
 On January 14, 2021, we entered into a Supply Agreement with Peter’s Technology (Suzhou) CO LTD. ("PTCS"), a Chinese subsidiary of Peter’s Co., Ltd., a Taiwan-based contract manufacturer ("the Peter's Supply Agreement"). In February 2021, PTCS began to produce commercially saleable OMNI units for us at its Suzhou City, China production facility. In May 2021, we entered into a separate supply agreement with a U.S.-based manufacturer with multiple manufacturing sites for the production in the United States of our OMNI Surgical System. Our supply agreements with these manufacturers contain customary terms and conditions. Pursuant to the Peter’s Supply Agreement, PTCS purchases components from our approved suppliers for assembly, and we make purchases from PTCS on a purchase order basis. The initial three-year term of the Peter’s Supply Agreement expires January 14, 2024, and the agreement provides for automatic renewals of additional one-year periods if neither party provides notification that they intend to terminate the agreement within 90 days of the term ending. We also have the right to terminate the agreement without cause during its term by providing 180 days’ advance written notice, or with 30 days’ written notice with any material agreement default by the manufacturer. We subsequently amended the Peter’s Supply Agreement in January and November 2022 to, among other things, contract with PTCS to manufacture our SmartLids and SION surgical instruments.
 For the production of our TearCare System components, we currently have supply arrangements with several medical device manufacturers. In addition to our agreement with PTCS for the production of SmartLids, we partner with various other suppliers for the production of the SmartHub and Clearance Assistant components of our TearCare System.
 We directly engage with several third-party suppliers for key components used in our products. We believe that our approved third-party suppliers will be adequate to meet our current and anticipated manufacturing needs. We do not currently plan to manufacture our products or any related components ourselves.
 Manufacturing facilities that produce medical devices or their component parts intended for distribution world-wide are subject to regulation and periodic unannounced inspection or audits by the FDA and other domestic and international regulatory agencies or notified bodies. In the United States, any products we sell are required to be manufactured in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation ("QSR"), which covers the methods used in, and the facilities used for, the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products.
 The distribution of our products is handled directly through a third-party logistics provider. Our finished goods are shipped from our contract manufacturers to a local gamma sterilization facility after which they are shipped to distribution facilities and, ultimately, to our customers.
 Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our current and future products and product candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and know-how; to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, seeking to obtain or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our proprietary technology that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions. We file new patent applications as we conduct research and development, initiate new programs, and monitor the activities of others. We also rely on other approaches to protecting our proprietary position, such as trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and/or continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
Patent Term
 Generally, issued patents are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional filing date. In certain instances, U.S. patent terms can be adjusted to recapture a portion of delay by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office ("USPTO"), in examining the patent application ("patent term adjustment") or extended to account for term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period ("patent term extension"), or both. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent may be shortened by terminal disclaimer, such that its term is reduced to end with that of an earlier-expiring patent.
Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. It is our policy to protect trade secrets and/or know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
Patents
 As of December 31, 2022, we owned 37 issued U.S. patents, 48 issued patents outside the U.S. (which includes five issued European patents and their national validations), 19 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, 19 pending foreign patent applications and two pending Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications. Our issued patents include claims directed to devices and methods for canaloplasty and/or trabeculotomy, ocular implants and related methods, the TearCare apparatus and methods of using the TearCare apparatus, components of the TearCare apparatus (including the SmartHub and SmartLids) and methods of their use, the TearCare apparatus in combination with an eyelid compression instrument and methods of their use, and methods of using the TearCare apparatus with patients wearing contact lenses.
 Subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities, and other charges, our issued U.S. patents have expiration dates between 2027 and 2041, with seven of our issued U.S. patents having expiration dates before 2030, 27 having expiration dates between 2031 and 2035, one having an expiration date in 2037, and the remaining two expiring in 2041, in each case exclusive of possible patent term extensions. Of our 19 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, one was filed in 2018, two were filed in 2019, three were filed in 2020, five were filed in 2021, and eight were filed in 2022. Our pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, if issued, have expected expiration dates between 2026 and 2042, exclusive of any possible patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
 The foreign jurisdictions where we own issued patents include: Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Subject to payment of required annuities and other charges, these foreign patents have expiration dates between 2027 and 2035. We have pending patent applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, and Japan which, if issued, have expected expiration dates between 2032 and 2040.
As of December 31, 2022, we owned eight U.S. trademark registrations, one EU trademark registration, one German trademark registration, one Swiss trademark registration, one UK trademark registration, four pending U.S. trademark applications, two pending Brazilian trademark applications, and one pending application for an International Registration designating Australia, EU, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Singapore.
Government Regulation
 Our products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. Our products are subject to regulation as medical devices in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and its implementing regulations.
United States Regulation
 The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, design, non-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export and post-marketing surveillance of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
 Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, or approval of a premarket approval ("PMA"), application.
 Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III— depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness.
Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s general controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of FDA’s current good manufacturing practices for devices, as reflected in the QSR, establishment registration and device listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Most Class I devices are exempt from the premarket notification requirements. Some Class I devices, called Class I reserved devices, require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below.
Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s general controls, and any other special controls deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, special labeling requirements, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents.
 Most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance.
 Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, requiring approval of a PMA. Due to the level of risk associated with Class III devices, the FDA’s general controls and special controls alone are insufficient to assure their safety and effectiveness. Devices placed in Class III require the submission of a PMA application demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the device, which must be approved by the FDA prior to marketing. The PMA approval process is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. A PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies.
 Our currently marketed OMNI and TearCare products are regulated as Class II devices subject to 510(k) clearance. Our SION surgical instrument is registered with the FDA as a Class I 510(k) exempt device.
Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. In the United States, absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials intended to support medical device clearance or approval or to determine safety and effectiveness of a device for an investigational use must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects.

If the device under evaluation does not present a significant risk to human health, then the device sponsor is not required to submit an IDE application to the FDA before initiating human clinical trials, but must still comply with abbreviated IDE requirements when conducting such trials.
Regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device, clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board ("IRB") for each clinical site. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an IRB, and the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. To conduct a clinical trial, we also are required to obtain the subjects’ informed consent in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. We, the FDA, or the IRB, could suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance or approval to market the product in the United States. Similarly, in Europe, the clinical study must be approved by a local ethics committee and in some cases, including studies with high-risk devices, by the ministry of health in the applicable country.
 During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and satisfy state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the potential benefits of the study are outweighed by cost, safety, or other factors.
 510(k) Clearance Process
 Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent,” as defined in the FDCA, to a legally marketed predicate device.
 A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. A device is considered to be substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics; or (ii) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device.
 Before the FDA will accept a 510(k) premarket notification for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If a 510(k) submission is accepted for substantive review, the Medical Device User Fee Amendments sets a performance goal of 90 days for FDA review of a 510(k) submission, but the review time can be delayed if FDA raises questions or requests addition information during the review process. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer than 90 days. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
 If the FDA determines that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous requirements of the PMA approval process, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device

in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for certain novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval or de novo reclassification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k), de novo request or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained or a de novo request is granted. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
 Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products.
Ongoing Regulation by the FDA
 Even after the FDA permits a device to be marketed, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 •Establishment of registration and device listing with the FDA;
 •QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, supplier/contractor selection, compliant handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
 •Labeling regulations, advertising and promotion requirements, restrictions on sale, distribution or sale of a device, each including the FDA prohibition against the promotion of products for any uses other than those authorized by the FDA, which are commonly known as “off-label” uses;
 •The Medical Device Reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
 •Medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
 •Recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death;
 •An order of repair, replacement, or refund;
 •Device tracking requirements; and
 •Post-market study and surveillance requirements.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) or possibly a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or possibly a PMA. The FDA could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or a PMA is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines and penalties.
 Some changes to an approved PMA device, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new PMA application or PMA supplement, as appropriate, before the change can be implemented. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required

for an original PMA application, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the device covered by the original PMA. The FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing PMA supplements as it does in reviewing original PMA applications.
 FDA regulations require us to register as a medical device manufacturer with the FDA. Additionally, some states also require medical device manufacturers and/or distributors doing business within the state to register with the state or apply for a state license, which could subject our facility to state inspection as well as FDA inspection on a routine basis for compliance with the QSR and any applicable state requirements. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain related documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities.
 Manufacturing processes for medical devices are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shutdown of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of marketed products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
 The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
 •Warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
 •Recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;
 •Operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
 •Refusing or delays in processing, clearing, or approving submissions or applications for new products or modifications to existing products;
 •Suspension or withdrawal of 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
 •FDA refusal to issue certification to foreign governments needed to export our products for sale in other countries; or
 •Criminal prosecution.
 International Regulation of Our Products
 Our research, development, and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in other countries. For example, the EU has adopted specific directives regulating the design, manufacture, clinical investigations, conformity assessment, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. EU directives must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states and national laws may vary from one member state to another.
 Until May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by Council Directive 93/42/EEC ("Medical Devices Directive") which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 ("EU MDR"). Our current certificates have been granted under the Medical Devices Directive. However, as of May 26, 2021, some of the EU MDR requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the Medical Devices Directive, with regard to registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance and vigilance requirements. Pursuing marketing of medical devices in the EU will notably require that our device be certified under the new regime set forth in the EU MDR when our current certificates expire. The current expiration date for our OMNI system certificate is May 26, 2024; however, on January 6, 2023, the European Commission issued a proposal that was subsequently approved by the European Parliament and

Council. This will extend the period during which devices similar to our OMNI device can continue to be placed in the EU market from May 26, 2024 to May 2028. The measure becomes effective upon publication in the EU Commission Journal.
Medical Devices Regulation
 On April 5, 2017, the EU MDR was adopted. The EU MDR establishes a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. Unlike the Medical Devices Directive, the EU MDR is directly applicable in EU member states without the need for member states to implement into national law. This aims at increasing harmonization across the EU.
 The EU MDR became effective on May 26, 2021. The new regulation among other things:
 •strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market (e.g. reclassification of certain devices and wider scope than the Medical Devices Directive) and reinforces surveillance once they are available;
 •establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
 •establishes explicit provisions on importers’ and distributors’ obligations and responsibilities; 
 •imposes an obligation to identify a responsible person who is ultimately responsible for all aspects of compliance with the requirements of the new regulation;
 •improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through the introduction of a unique identification number, to increase the ability of manufacturers and regulatory authorities to trace specific devices through the supply chain and to facilitate the prompt and efficient recall of medical devices that have been found to present a safety risk;
 •sets up a central database ("Eudamed") to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and
 •strengthens the rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo a clinical evaluation consultation procedure by experts before they are placed on the market.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements and allow the marketing of medical devices that meet EU requirements. As of January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom has entered a transition period following Brexit. During that period, the UK Medical Devices Regulations ("UK MDR") 2002 remains applicable in England, Scotland and Wales (Great Britain). During 2021, a UK Responsible Person was appointed and we registered the OMNI System with the Medicines and Healthcare products regulatory agency. Valid CE marks will continue to be accepted in Great Britain, and the requirement to obtain a UK Conformity Assessed ("UKCA") mark has been delayed until July 2024.
 The current expiration date for our OMNI system certificate is on May 26, 2024. However, on January 6, 2023, the European Commission issued a proposal that was subsequently approved by the European Parliament and Council. This proposal, which becomes effective upon its publication in the EU Commission Journal, will extend the period during which devices similar to our OMNI device can continue to be placed on the EU market from May 26, 2024 to December 31, 2028.
 Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
 In the United States, we are subject to a number of federal and state healthcare regulatory laws that restrict business practices in the healthcare industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti- kickback, false claims, transparency and other healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
 The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including cash, improper

discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. Among other things, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between medical device manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers and purchasers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. The government can exercise enforcement discretion in taking action against unprotected activities. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti- kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions, and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers and self-pay patients.
 The federal false claims, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program ("CHIP"), with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, such obligations will include payments and other transfers of value provided in the previous year to additional healthcare professionals, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse midwives.
 Violations of fraud and abuse laws, including federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 In the United States, our currently cleared products are not separately reimbursed by any third-party payors, and if covered, are paid for as part of the procedure in which the product is used. Our commercial success depends in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the procedures in which our products are used. Failure by physicians, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and other users of our products to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures in which our products are used, or adverse changes in government and private third-party payors’ coverage and reimbursement policies, may adversely impact demand for our products.


Based on our experience to date, third-party payors generally reimburse for the procedures in which our products are used only if the patient meets the established medical necessity criteria for the procedure. Some payors are moving toward a managed care system and control their healthcare costs by establishing coverage policies that categorically restrict coverage of certain procedures, or by limiting authorization for procedures, including elective procedures using our devices. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among payors in the United States exists, and coverage and reimbursement for procedures can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors are increasingly auditing and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services with concern for upcoding, miscoding, using inappropriate modifiers, or billing for inappropriate care settings. Some third-party payors must approve coverage for new or innovative devices or procedures before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use the products or therapies. Even though a new product may have been cleared for commercial distribution by the FDA, we may find limited demand for our product unless reimbursement approval can be obtained and/or maintained from governmental and private third-party payors.
 In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement levels. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes routine updates to payments to physicians, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers for procedures during which our products are used. These updates could directly impact the demand for our products.
 We believe the overall escalating cost of medical products and services being paid for by the government and private health insurance has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare and medical device industry to reduce the costs of products and services. Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs through prospective reimbursement and capitation programs, group purchasing, redesign of benefits, and exploration of more cost-effective methods of delivering healthcare. In the United States, some insured individuals enroll in managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. Some managed care programs pay their providers on a per capita (patient) basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying these providers a predetermined payment per member per month and, consequently, may limit the willingness of these providers to use our products.
 Healthcare Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our products.
 The implementation of the Affordable Care Act ("ACA") in the United States, for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The ACA, among other things, provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the ACA expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. It is unclear how healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the law or our business.
 In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 repealed

the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments that began in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations.
 We expect additional state, federal, and foreign healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal, state, and foreign governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
 Data Privacy and Security Laws
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health- related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, including HIPAA, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA") and the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
 In Europe, the GDPR went into effect on May 25, 2018 and introduces strict requirements for processing the personal data of European Union data subjects. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States, and the efficacy and longevity of current transfer mechanisms between the EU and the United States remains uncertain.
 Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation ("UK GDPR"), which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is also unclear how United Kingdom data protection laws and regulations will develop, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated.
Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 250 full-time employees. Our highly qualified and experienced team includes scientists, physicians and professionals across sales, marketing, regulatory, finance and other important functions that are critical to our success. We believe that the success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are a party to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that we have good relations with our employees.
We believe that our continued success is reliant on the ability to attract, develop and retain top talent. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to foster an inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive compensation and benefits programs. In the attraction, development and retention of talent, we emphasize:
 Compensation and Benefits. We strive to provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to attract and retain top talent and review these programs annually against the competitive landscape to ensure they continue to meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs include a variety of short and long-term incentive plans such as annual bonuses, equity awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules,

and employee assistance programs. In addition to our broad-based equity award programs, we have used targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate the retention and engagement of our talent.
 Talent Development. We believe employees are our greatest asset and we strive to provide development and promotional opportunities in order to help our employees reach their potential. We provide formal and informal training opportunities designed to enhance learning and development. Consistent with our performance review processes, we foster and encourage continuous manager and employee dialogue around performance and development.
 Health, Safety and Wellness. We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. One of our core values is diversity of thought, values, individual characteristics, beliefs and backgrounds. We are an equal opportunity employer and believe that diverse and differentiated views contribute to make us a better organization. It is our conscious effort to support the advancement of women and promote equal opportunity for all our employees within the workplace.
