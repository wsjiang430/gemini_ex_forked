ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
CORPORATE HISTORY
 
  Duke Mountain Resources, Inc. ("Duke Mountain," "we," "our," or "us,") is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Nevada and was incorporated on May 3, 2006. Our authorized capital consists of 76,000,000 common shares, with a par value of $0.001 per share. As of December 31, 2016, we had 12,180,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.  Our corporate headquarters are located at 3948 Saratoga Road, Langley, Washington 98260. Our telephone number is 360-292-6860.
 
As we are a smaller reporting company, certain disclosures otherwise required to be made in a Form 10-K are not required to be made by us.
 
We were an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. On December 19, 2011, we attained 100% mineral interest rights to a property located in Pershing County, Nevada called "Tonya" (the "Tonya Property"). Although exploratory work in the area of our property conducted by others has indicated some potential showings of mineralization, we are uncertain as to the reproducibility of these prior exploration results and thus we are uncertain as to the potential existence of a commercially viable mineral deposit existing on our mineral claims.
 
On December 31, 2013, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Fostung Resources, which is the holder of certain leases and mining claims to a fostung tungsten property located in Foster Township, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada (the "Fostung Property") from RenovaCare, Inc. (f/k/a Janus Resources, Inc.) ("Janus"), a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Nevada, for a promissory note (the "Promissory Note") in the amount of $80,000 (the "Fostung Purchase"), the fair value of the leases and mining claims controlled by Fostung Resources as concluded by an independent third-party geological consultant. The Promissory Note bears an annual interest rate of 4%, which is compounded annually and has a maturity date of December 31, 2015. In the event of certain events of default, as more fully set forth in the Promissory Note, the interest rate on the Promissory Note would increase to 8%. We may prepay the Promissory Note at any time without penalty.
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, there are no known mineral reserves on either the Tonya Property or the Fostung Property.
 
We have not earned any revenues to date. We do not anticipate earning revenues until such time as we enter into commercial production of our mineral properties. We are presently in the exploration stage of our business and we can provide no assurance that any commercially viable mineral deposits exist on our mineral claims, that we will discover commercially exploitable levels of mineral resources on our properties, or, if such deposits are discovered, that we will enter into further substantial exploration programs.
