We empower clients across markets and industries to better execute all aspects of their business, from managing risk, identifying fraud and abuse, and ensuring legislative compliance, to debt recovery.
 We provide unique and compelling solutions essential to the daily workflow of organizations within both the public and private sectors. Our cloud-based data fusion platform, combined with our massive database consisting of public-record, proprietary and publicly-available data, as well as a unique repository of self-reported information on millions of consumers, enables the delivery of differentiated products and solutions used for a variety of essential functions. These essential functions include identification and authentication, and investigation and validation.
 Leveraging leading-edge technology, proprietary algorithms, and massive datasets, and through intuitive and powerful analytical applications, we provide solutions to organizations within the risk management industry. CORE is our next generation data fusion platform, providing mission-critical information about individuals, businesses and assets to a variety of markets and industries. Through machine learning and advanced analytics, we use the power of data fusion to ingest and analyze data at a massive scale. The derived information from the data fusion process ultimately serves to generate unique solutions for banking and financial services companies, insurance companies, healthcare companies, law enforcement and government, the collection industry, law firms, retail, telecommunications companies, corporate security and investigative firms.

Our average query response time for a comprehensive profile is less than 250 milliseconds versus competitive platforms that measure comprehensive profile response times in seconds.
 On March 26, 2018, Fluent, Inc. (“Fluent”), formerly known as Cogint, Inc. (“cogint”), a Delaware corporation, completed a spin-off (the “Spin-off”) of its risk management business from its digital marketing business by way of a distribution of all the shares of common stock of Fluent’s wholly-owned subsidiary, red violet, to Fluent’s stockholders of record as of March 19, 2018 (the “Record Date”) and certain warrant holders. The distribution occurred by way of a pro rata stock distribution to such common stock and warrant holders, each of whom received one share of red violet’s common stock for every 7.5 shares of Fluent’s common stock held on the Record Date or to which they were entitled to under their warrants, which resulted in a distribution of a total of 10,266,613 shares of red violet common stock. Upon the Spin-off, red violet owns Fluent subsidiaries which previously operated Fluent’s risk management business.
 As a result of the Spin-off, red violet is an independent public company and red violet’s common stock began regular-way trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “RDVT” on March 27, 2018.

From inception of our risk management business in September 2014 through December 2016, the majority of our operations were dedicated to the early-stage development of our business model, including the development of our proprietary, cloud-based technology platform, CORE, and the buildout of our initial-phase suite of products, powered by CORE, to serve a variety of industries within risk management. Beginning January 2017, with our technology platform production ready and hardened, our initial suite of products released into the marketplace, and a multi-year product roadmap defined, we transformed from a development organization to a sales-driven organization with sales increasing from a $5.8 million annual run-rate for the month ended January 31, 2017 to a $18.6 million annual run-rate for the month ended December 31, 2018. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had revenue of $16.3 million and $8.6 million, net loss of $6.9 million and $21.5 million, and adjusted EBITDA of negative $4.3 million and negative $8.3 million, respectively. For periods prior to the Spin-off, all the financial information of red violet referred to red violet and Fluent subsidiaries that previously operated Fluent’s risk management business. For periods prior to the Spin-off, the Company’s financial statements were prepared on a consolidated and combined basis because certain of the entities were under common control. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated between the consolidated and combined entities. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure based on US GAAP, excluding interest income, net, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, litigation costs, insurance proceeds in relation to settled litigation, transition service income, and write-off of long-lived assets and others, as noted in the tables included in “Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 Our Markets
 The target market for our products and solutions today consists primarily of organizations within the risk management industry.
 The big data and analytics sector continues to grow at an accelerated pace due to the proliferation of data generated over the past two decades from both traditional and emerging sources, including e-commerce, mobile and social media. International Data Corporation, a global provider of market intelligence and advisory services, estimates that worldwide revenue for big data and business analytics services is expected to reach $260.0 billion in the year 2022, representing a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 11.9% from 2017 through 2022. Continued, rapid innovation and adoption of new technologies presents enormous challenges for organizations of all types to sort through this sea of data to glean actionable intelligence and address their mission-critical business functions. These challenges serve as key drivers of the sector’s growth. Our industry-agnostic platform, solutions, and analytical capabilities are designed to solve the myriad of complex problems that organizations face on a daily basis.
 Risk management and fraud analytics has become increasingly important not only in the banking and financial services sectors but across multiple other industries and use cases. According to the market research company MarketsAndMarkets, the risk analytics software market is projected to grow to $35.9 billion by 2022, representing CAGR of 15.3% from 2017 through 2022, with North America estimated to hold the largest market share in the risk analytics market. Data fusion analytics and the information derived therefrom is now the primary service product for risk management associated with key purchasers such as banking and financial services companies, insurance companies, healthcare companies, law enforcement and government, collection agencies, law firms, retail, telecommunications companies and investigative firms. Primary use cases include, but are not limited to, obtaining information on consumers, businesses and assets (and their interrelationships) to facilitate the location of individuals and assets, identity verification, legislative compliance and to support criminal, legal, financial, insurance, and corporate investigations, due diligence and the assessment and mitigation of counterparty risk.
 Key Challenges Facing our Customers
 We believe our products and solutions address the challenges that the industry faces today, which include:
 Actionable Big Data Insights Through A Single Platform— As the velocity and volume of data continues to grow exponentially, enterprises have become overwhelmed with data and their inability to glean intelligence from such data to derive successful business decisions in real-time. Customers demand full-suite, turn-key solutions that are agile, flexible, and available on-demand in order to gain the speed, scale and insight necessary to drive their business models. As the breadth and depth of data increases, providers will need to deploy new technologies that enable both the ingestion of data at massive scale in real-time, irrespective of structure or form, and the analytics components necessary to function across multiple channels. The continued digitization of human interactions, and the corresponding availability of the data resulting therefrom, is driving demand for data capture, management and analysis software. As a result, customers are looking for flexible and efficient solutions to fuse disparate sets of not only transactional data but also demographic, ethnographic and behavioral data as well, in order to provide insights that are truly actionable.
 2
 


Cost and Performance Pressures—As our customers face constant cost pressures, they need to continually improve the value they receive from their information solutions. Whether it is right-party contact, managing risk, skip tracing or regulatory compliance, customers are increasingly more sophisticated, requiring enhanced performance that provides fast, accurate, and cost-effective solutions to satisfy their business objectives. Improving performance can mean delivering the right data at the right time, or providing the most intuitive information as rapidly as possible to capitalize on opportunities or reduce risk. Superior data fusion with unique data sources delivers customers an advantage as they cope with these pressures.
 Delivering Solutions for Complex Problems Using Scalable Data Analytics—The larger and more complex a data repository, the more difficult it is to provide sustained levels of performance and insight. The highly-fragmented nature of data across multiple mediums, proliferation of data and lack of robust technology limits the ability to aggregate actionable information into a comprehensive view. There is an inherent need for information solutions that allow businesses to leverage data that provides actionable intelligence to support debt recovery, fraud detection and prevention, investigations, due diligence, identity verification, and legislative compliance in a more efficient manner.
Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe our leading-edge technology platform, massive database of consumer profiles, and dynamic and intuitive solutions deliver superior capabilities to our customers. Our solutions enable our customers to make more informed inquiries regarding their problems and better decisions to solve their most complex problems. We believe the following competitive strengths will continue to deliver an unrivaled value proposition that further drives our differentiation:
 Transformative and Innovative Technology Platform—Through the power of our platform, CORE, we offer a comprehensive suite of information solutions. Our cloud-based, data and industry agnostic platform allows us to assimilate, structure, and fuse billions of disparate records to create comprehensive profiles of individuals and to present these insights in real-time via analytical applications. We believe our platform’s speed, power, and scalability are key differentiators in the marketplace.
 Massive Database of Holistic Consumer Profiles—Data is the lifeblood of our technology platform. We leverage our CORE platform to build massive proprietary datasets and apply analytics in real-time to provide actionable insights. Our data is compiled from a myriad of online and offline sources, both structured and unstructured, including public record, publicly-available, proprietary, and self-reported data. Public record data includes personally identifiable information, as well as property, identity, bankruptcy, lien, judgment, automotive, phone and other information aggregated from companies specializing in data aggregation, public record repositories, and publicly-available sources. Proprietary data includes data internally generated by proprietary algorithms and analytic processes. Through next-generation technology and proprietary algorithms, we efficiently ingest these datasets, structure them into normalized form, and utilize the process of data fusion to resolve unique identities so as to create an actionable, real-time view of the data for various use cases, delivering greater intelligence to our customers and enhancing their decision-making capabilities across all markets and industries.
Our Platform and Solutions
 Leveraging leading-edge technology, proprietary algorithms, and massive datasets, and through intuitive and powerful analytics, we provide industry-agnostic analytical solutions for organizations within the risk management industry. These organizations use our services to perform due diligence, collect debt, verify consumer identities, investigate fraud and abuse, mitigate risk, and locate assets, among other things. Our core capabilities and technology platform allow us to serve a broad and diverse set of industries and to solve a wide range of issues facing organizations daily.
 CORE—our advanced analytical platform, provides cloud-based, mission-critical solutions to a variety of markets and industries. Our primary investigative solution, idiCORE, provides instant, comprehensive views of individuals, businesses, assets and their interrelationships to multiple industries, including law enforcement, government, financial services, insurance, and corporate risk for purposes such as identity verification, risk assessment, fraud detection, and compliance.
 Our Sales, Distribution and Marketing
 Inside Sales—Our inside sales team cultivates relationships, and ultimately closes business, with their end-user markets. These professionals are relationship-based sellers with experience in identifying clients’ needs and clearly explaining and defining products that provide solutions to those needs.
 3
 


Strategic Sales—While the majority of our direct sales efforts are supported through professional inside sales staff, major accounts within certain industries require a more personal, face-to-face strategic sales approach. We continue to expand this team to meet the demand of the markets.
 Distributors, Resellers, and Strategic Partners—In conjunction with direct-to-client sales efforts, we engage value-added distributors, resellers, and strategic partners that have a significant foothold in many of the industries that we have not historically served, as well as to further penetrate those industries that we do serve. This allows us to rapidly penetrate these markets while also significantly reducing overhead associated with direct sales and support efforts.
 Marketing—We have implemented several methods to market our products, including participation in trade shows and seminars, advertising, public relations, distribution of sales literature and product specifications and ongoing communication with prospective clients, distributors, resellers, strategic partners and our installed base of current clients.
Our Strategy
 We are committed to developing unique technology and using our analytical capabilities to deliver solutions that transform the way organizations view data. We are advancing our business through the following strategic approach:

• | The Risk Management Industry—providing actionable intelligence in support of a multitude of use cases, such as the verification and authentication of consumer identities, due diligence, prevention of fraud and abuse, legislative compliance, and debt collection.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Custom Analytics—enabling the public and private sectors to leverage our advanced data fusion platform and analytical applications to obtain insight essential to decision-making processes throughout each client organization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We will remain focused on building the business organically and will continue to devote resources to the following to ensure that we are well positioned within the industry:
 Continuous Advancement of Our Technology and Data to Cross-sell and Upsell—We strongly believe that our ability to continually innovate and invest resources into our technology and data is a key foundation to our success. In addition to improving our predictive software and underlying technology platform, we aim to provide new solutions from our data repository in an effort to offer the greatest value to our clients. We believe this allocation of resources will augment our value proposition for both existing and prospective clients. As we invest in our technology platform and data assets, we will always do so with a view towards providing solutions that deliver scalability, functionality and interoperability. Our technology platform is designed to deliver reliable and accurate information with the scale of global populations and cohorts in mind. Derived semantic insight increases exponentially with each new data asset, creating compounded additional value that can be used by supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. As a result of our ability to process transactional data, self-reported data, and other proprietary datasets at massive scale, we are focused on creating a dynamic platform that maximizes interoperability and continues to drive growth opportunities within our installed customer base.
 Selective Acquisitions—In addition to organic growth, we may, in the future, make acquisitions of businesses or technologies that advance our objectives and that enhance shareholder value. We are focused on identifying complementary technologies and businesses that advance our strategic approach. While we maintain our long-term strategy of increasing revenue, gaining market share and enhancing shareholder value through internal development and organic growth, we will continually seek to identify and pursue acquisition opportunities that fit within our strategy.
Our Competition
 Competition in the big data and analytics sector centers on innovation, product stability, pricing and customer service. The market for our products and services is highly competitive and is subject to constant change. We compete on the basis of differentiated solutions, analytical capabilities, integration with our clients’ technology, client relationships, service stability, innovation and price. We believe we are well-positioned to effectively compete on all fronts.
 Our competitors vary widely in size and nature of the products and services they offer. There are a large number of competitors who offer products and services in specialized areas, such as fraud prevention, risk management and decisioning solutions. We believe our next-generation data fusion technology, analytical capabilities, robust database, and the intelligent design of our cloud-based infrastructure will allow us to differentiate ourselves from our competition in flexibility, capability, service and price.

Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources, better name recognition and a larger customer base. Even if we introduce advanced products that meet evolving customer requirements in a timely manner, there can be no assurance that our new products will gain market acceptance.
 Certain companies in the big data and analytics sector have expanded their product lines or technologies in recent years as a result of acquisitions. Further, more companies have developed products which conform to existing and emerging industry standards and have sought to compete on the basis of price. We anticipate increased competition from large data and analytics vendors. Increased competition in the big data and analytics sector could result in significant price competition, reduced profit margins or loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future with current or new competitors.
 Concentration of Customers
 We have established relationships with a number of customers, many of whom could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time. Market competition, customer requirements, customer financial condition and customer consolidation through mergers or acquisitions also could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand these relationships. There is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements, maintain relationships with any of our customers on acceptable terms or at all or collect amounts owed to us from insolvent customers. The loss of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, there was one customer that accounted for 11% of total revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2017, no individual customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. 
 As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, no individual customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable.
 Concentration of Suppliers
 Our products and services depend extensively upon continued access to and receipt of data from external sources, including data received from the major credit bureaus, including our largest data supplier. The Company’s other data suppliers include strategic partners, as well as various government and public records repositories. Our largest data supplier, with whom we have expanded our relationship while securing favorable business terms over the years, accounted for approximately 46% of our total data acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to approximately 43% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The initial term of the agreement, as amended, with this supplier ends April 30, 2022, and continues thereafter on a month-to-month basis unless and until either party provides the other with a minimum of 30 days’ written notice of termination. During the term of the agreement, either party has the right to terminate the agreement: (i) in the event of the other party’s failure to cure a material breach, and (ii) in the event of the other party’s insolvency. In addition, this supplier may terminate this agreement by providing not less than 150 days’ advance written notice to us and we may terminate this agreement by providing not less than 24 months’ advance written notice to this supplier. The remaining minimum purchase commitments through the end of the initial term is $14.9 million. If we are unable to maintain our relationship with our largest data supplier, our ability to provide products and services could be negatively impacted, as we would need to secure comparable data on similar terms, which would require significant time, expense, and resources, and may in the short-term adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations and, if we are unable to establish a similar relationship with other data suppliers over time, could have a long-term material impact on our business and financial condition.
Our Intellectual Property
 We avail ourself of applicable trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our proprietary technology, trademark law to protect our trademarks and domain names, and copyright laws to protect our content relating to, among other things, websites and marketing materials. Our intellectual property rights are embodied in confidential and proprietary technology and data, trademarked brands relating to our business units, products, services, and solutions, original content on our materials such as websites and marketing materials, and domain names. With respect to our trademarks, we maintain an extensive portfolio of perpetual common law and federally-registered trademark rights across several brands. We have also sought protection and registration of certain brands and trademarks internationally, such as in Europe and Canada. At present, we do not hold any issued patents.
 
We use data acquired through licensing rights from approximately 20 providers. The loss of any one of these providers could have an immediate near-term impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Also see “Concentration of Suppliers” above.

Regulatory Matters
 Our business is subject to various federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations, including, without limitation, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 6801- 6809) (“GLBA”), the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act (18 U.S.C. §§ 2721- 2725) (“DPPA”) and the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”). A change in any one of a number of the laws, rules, or regulations applicable to our business or the enactment of new or amended legislation or industry regulations pertaining to consumer or private sector privacy issues could have a material adverse impact on information services. Legislation or industry regulations regarding consumer or private sector privacy issues could place restrictions upon the collection, sharing and use of information that is currently legally available, which could materially increase our cost of collecting and maintaining some data. These types of legislation or industry regulations could also prohibit us from collecting or disseminating certain types of data, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our clients’ requirements and our profitability and cash flow targets.
Seasonality
 Our results are subject to seasonal fluctuation. Historically, certain products experience seasonal pressure during the fourth quarter.
 Management Team
 Our management team has a track record of strong performance and significant expertise in the markets we serve. We have built the leading companies in our industry, creating significant shareholder value. We continue to attract and retain experienced management talent for our business. Our team has deep knowledge of the big data and analytics sector and expertise across the various industries that we serve. Our team has overseen the expansion of our proprietary technology platform while managing ongoing initiatives, including the transition from a development-focused company to a sales-driven company. As a result, we are well positioned to continue to successfully drive growth organically.
Our Employees
 We employ 95 full-time and 2 part-time employees as of December 31, 2018. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization, and none are party to any collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good. Competition in the recruiting of personnel in the big data and analytics sector is intense. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire, motivate and retain qualified sales and marketing, executive and administrative and technical personnel. To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining qualified employees.
