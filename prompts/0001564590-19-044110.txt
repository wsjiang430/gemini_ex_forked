--------+---------

General Business of PennantPark Investment Corporation
 PennantPark Investment Corporation is a BDC whose objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation while seeking to preserve capital through debt and equity investments primarily made to U.S. middle-market companies in the form of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt and subordinated debt and equity investments.
 We believe U.S. middle-market companies offer attractive risk-reward to investors due to a limited amount of capital available for such companies. We seek to create a diversified portfolio that includes first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments by investing approximately $10 million to $50 million of capital, on average, in the securities of middle-market companies. We expect this investment size to vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. We use the term “middle-market” to refer to companies with annual revenues between $50 million and $1 billion. The companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, are not rated by national rating agencies. If such companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard & Poor’s system) from the national rating agencies. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as “leveraged loans” or “high yield” securities or “junk bonds” and are often higher risk compared to debt instruments that are rated above investment grade and have speculative characteristics. Our debt investments may generally range in maturity from three to ten years and are made to U.S. and, to a limited extent, non-U.S. corporations, partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions.
 Our investment activity depends on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives.
 Organization and Structure of PennantPark Investment Corporation
 PennantPark Investment Corporation, a Maryland corporation organized in January 2007, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code.
 SBIC II, our wholly owned subsidiary, was organized in Delaware as a limited partnership in July 2012. SBIC II received a license from the SBA to operate as a SBIC under Section 301(c) of the 1958 Act in 2013. SBIC II’s objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments generally by investing with us in SBA-eligible businesses that meet the investment selection criteria used by PennantPark Investment. During the year ended September 30, 2019, we liquidated and dissolved SBIC I.
 
Funding I, our wholly owned subsidiary and a special purpose entity, was organized in Delaware as a limited liability company in February 2019. We formed Funding I in order to establish the BNP Credit Facility. The Investment Adviser serves as the servicer to Funding I and has irrevocably directed that the management fee owed to it with respect to such services be paid to us so long as the Investment Adviser remains the servicer. This arrangement does not increase our consolidated management fee. The BNP Credit Facility allows Funding I to borrow up to $250 million at LIBOR plus 260 basis points during the reinvestment period. The BNP Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets held by Funding I. 
 Our Investment Adviser and Administrator
 We utilize the investing experience and contacts of PennantPark Investment Advisers in developing what we believe is an attractive and diversified portfolio. The senior investment professionals of the Investment Adviser have worked together for many years and average over 25 years of experience in the senior lending, mezzanine lending, leveraged finance, distressed debt and private equity businesses. In addition, our senior investment professionals have been involved in originating, structuring, negotiating, managing and monitoring investments in each of these businesses across changing economic and market cycles. We believe this experience and history has resulted in a strong reputation with financial sponsors, management teams, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, which provides us with access to substantial investment opportunities across the capital markets. Our Investment Adviser has a rigorous investment approach, which is based upon intensive financial analysis with a focus on capital preservation, diversification and active management. Since our Investment Adviser’s inception in 2007, it has invested through its managed funds $10 billion in 526 companies with approximately 185 different financial sponsors.
 Our Administrator has experienced professionals with substantial backgrounds in finance and administration of registered investment companies. In addition to furnishing us with clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services, the Administrator also oversees our financial records as well as the preparation of our reports to stockholders and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and the SBA. The Administrator assists in the determination and publication of our net asset value, or NAV, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns, and monitors the payment of our expenses as well as the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Furthermore, our Administrator offers, on our behalf, significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to offer such assistance. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business and Structure—There are significant potential conflicts of interest which could impact our investment returns” for more information.

Market Opportunity
 We believe that the limited amount of capital available to middle-market companies, coupled with the desire of these companies for flexible sources of capital, creates an attractive investment environment for us.

• | We believe middle-market companies have faced difficulty raising debt in private markets. From time to time, banks, finance companies, hedge funds and collateralized loan obligation, or CLO, funds have withdrawn, and may again withdraw, capital from the middle-market, resulting in opportunities for alternative funding sources.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe middle-market companies have faced difficulty in raising debt through the capital markets. Many middle-market companies look to raise funds by issuing high-yield bonds and broadly syndicated loans. We believe this approach to financing becomes difficult at times when institutional investors seek to invest in larger, more liquid offerings. We believe this has made it harder for middle-market companies to raise funds by issuing high-yield securities from time to time.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe that credit market dislocation for middle-market companies improves the risk-reward on our investments. From time to time, market participants have reduced lending to middle-market and non-investment grade borrowers. As a result, we believe there is less competition in our market, more conservative capital structures, higher yields and stronger covenants.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital likely to seek to combine their capital with sources of debt capital to complete private investments. We expect that private equity firms will continue to be active investors in middle-market companies. These private equity funds generally seek to leverage their investments by combining their capital with loans provided by other sources, and we believe that we are well-positioned to partner with such equity investors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe there is substantial supply of opportunities resulting from maturing loans that seek refinancing. A high volume of financings will come due in the next few years. Additionally, we believe that demand for debt financing from middle-market companies will remain strong because these companies will continue to require credit to refinance existing debt, to support growth initiatives and to finance acquisitions. We believe the combination of strong demand by middle-market companies and from time to time the reduced supply of credit described above should increase lending opportunities for us. We believe this supply of opportunities coupled with a lack of demand offers attractive risk-reward to investors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Advantages
 We believe that we have the following competitive advantages over other capital providers to middle-market companies: 
  
a) | Experienced Management Team
---+----------------------------

 The senior investment professionals of our Investment Adviser have worked together for many years and average over 25 years of experience in senior lending, mezzanine lending, leveraged finance, distressed debt and private equity businesses. These senior investment professionals have been involved in originating, structuring, negotiating, managing and monitoring investments in each of these businesses across changing economic and market cycles. We believe this extensive experience and history has resulted in a strong reputation across the capital markets.
 Lending to middle-market companies requires in-depth diligence, credit expertise, restructuring experience and active portfolio management. For example, lending to middle-market companies in the United States is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of the information available with respect to such companies. We are able to provide value-added customized financial solutions to middle-market companies as a result of specialized due diligence, underwriting capabilities and more extensive ongoing monitoring required as lenders.
  
b) | Disciplined Investment Approach with Strong Value Orientation
---+--------------------------------------------------------------

 We employ a disciplined approach in selecting investments that meet the long-standing, consistent value-oriented investment selection criteria employed by our Investment Adviser. Our value-oriented investment philosophy focuses on preserving capital and ensuring that our investments have an appropriate return profile in relation to risk. When market conditions make it difficult for us to invest according to our criteria, we are highly selective in deploying our capital. We believe this approach continues to enable us to build an attractive investment portfolio that meets our return and value criteria over the long-term.
 We believe it is critical to conduct extensive due diligence on investment targets. In evaluating new investments we, through our Investment Adviser, conduct a rigorous due diligence process that draws from our Investment Adviser’s experience, industry expertise and network of contacts. Among other things, our due diligence is designed to ensure that each prospective portfolio company will be able to meet its debt service obligations. See “Investment Selection Criteria” for more information.
 In addition to engaging in extensive due diligence, our Investment Adviser seeks to reduce risk by focusing on businesses with:
  
• | strong competitive positions;
--+------------------------------


• | positive cash flow that is steady and stable;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | experienced management teams with strong track records;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | potential for growth and viable exit strategies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | capital structures offering appropriate risk-adjusted terms and covenants.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


c) | Ability to Source and Evaluate Transactions through our Investment Adviser’s Proactive, Research Capability and Established Network
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The management team of our Investment Adviser has long-term relationships with financial sponsors, management consultants and management teams that we believe enable us to evaluate investment opportunities effectively in numerous industries, as well as provide us access to substantial information concerning those industries. We identify potential investments both through active origination and through dialogue with numerous financial sponsors, management teams, members of the financial community and corporate partners with whom the professionals of our Investment Adviser have long-term relationships.

d) | Flexible Transaction Structuring
---+---------------------------------

 We are flexible in structuring investments and tailor investments to meet the needs of a portfolio company while also generating attractive risk-adjusted returns. We can invest in all parts of a capital structure and our Investment Adviser has extensive experience in a wide variety of securities for leveraged companies throughout economic and market cycles.
 Our Investment Adviser seeks to minimize the risk of capital loss without foregoing potential for capital appreciation. In making investment decisions, we seek to invest in companies that we believe can generate consistent positive risk-adjusted returns.
 We believe that the in-depth experience of our Investment Adviser will enable us to invest throughout various stages of the economic and market cycles and to provide us with ongoing market insights in addition to a significant investment opportunity.
 Competition
 Our primary competitors provide financing to middle-market companies and include other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies, CLO funds, private direct lending funds, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Additionally, alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, frequently invest in middle-market companies. As a result, competition for investment opportunities in middle-market companies can be intense. However, we believe that from time to time there has been a reduction in the amount of debt capital available to middle-market companies, which we believe has resulted in a less competitive environment for making new investments.
 Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business and Structure—We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities” for more information.
 Leverage
 On February 22, 2019, Funding I closed the BNP Credit Facility for up to $250.0 million in borrowings with certain lenders and BNP Paribas, as administrative agent, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as collateral agent. As of September 30, 2019, Funding I had $171.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the BNP Credit Facility. The BNP Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 4.6%, exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitment, as of September 30, 2019. The BNP Credit Facility is a five-year revolving facility with a stated maturity date of February 22, 2024 and pricing set at 260 basis points over LIBOR. As of September 30, 2019, Funding I had $79.0 million of unused borrowing capacity under the BNP Credit Facility, subject to the regulatory restrictions. The BNP Credit Facility is secured by all of our assets held by Funding I. We own 100% of the equity interest in Funding I and treat the indebtedness of Funding I as our leverage. Our Investment Adviser serves as the servicer to Funding I in connection with the BNP Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2019, we were in compliance with the terms of the BNP Credit Facility.
 As of September 30, 2019, we had the multi-currency SunTrust Credit Facility for up to $475.0 million in borrowings with certain lenders and SunTrust Bank, acting as administrative agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting as syndication agent for the lenders. As of September 30, 2019 and 2018, we had $301.6 million and $80.5 million (including a $2.0 million temporary draw), respectively, in outstanding borrowings under the SunTrust Credit Facility. The SunTrust Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 4.2% and 3.8%, respectively, exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitment, as of September 30, 2019 and 2018. The SunTrust Credit Facility is a revolving facility with a stated maturity date of September 4, 2024, a one-year term-out period on September 4, 2023 and pricing set at 225 basis points over LIBOR. As of September 30, 2019 and 2018, we had $173.4 million and $364.5 million of unused borrowing capacity under the SunTrust Credit Facility, respectively, subject to the regulatory restrictions. The SunTrust Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets excluding assets held by Funding I and SBIC II. As of September 30, 2019, we were in compliance with the terms of the SunTrust Credit Facility.
 As of September 30, 2019 and 2018, our SBIC Funds had $150.0 million and $300.0 million in debt commitments, respectively, of which $150.0 million and $180.0 million was drawn, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.1% and 3.2%, respectively, exclusive of the 3.4% of upfront fees. As of September 30, 2019 and 2018, our SBA debentures mature between March 2026 to March 2028 and September 2021 to March 2028, respectively. SBA debentures offer competitive terms such as being non-recourse to us, a 10-year maturity, semi-annual interest payments, not requiring principal payments prior to maturity and may be prepaid at any time without penalty. During the year ended September 30, 2019, we liquidated and dissolved SBIC I. The SBA debentures are secured by all the investment portfolio assets of SBIC II and have a priority claim over such assets relative to all other creditors. See “Regulation” for more information.
 As of September 30, 2019, we had $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes outstanding. Interest on the 2024 Notes is paid quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, at a rate of 5.50% per year, commencing January 15, 2020. The 2024 Notes mature on October 15, 2024. The 2024 Notes are direct unsecured obligations and rank pari passu in right of payment with future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness. The 2024 Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. The 2024 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option on or after October 15, 2021 at a redemption price of 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 As of September 30, 2018, we had $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes outstanding. Interest on the 2019 Notes was paid at a rate of 4.50% per year and was paid semi-annually. On March 4, 2019, the 2019 Notes were redeemed in full and no amounts were outstanding as of September 30, 2019. Interest on the 2019 Notes was paid at a rate of 4.50% per year and was paid semi-annually. The 2019 Notes had been scheduled to mature on October 1, 2019. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more information.
 On February 5, 2019, our stockholders approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (which includes the SBCAA) as approved by our board of directors on November 13, 2018. As a result, the asset coverage requirement applicable to us for senior securities was reduced from 200% (i.e., $1 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity) to 150% (i.e., $2 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity), subject to compliance with certain disclosure requirements. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more information. 
 Investment Policy Overview
 We seek to create a diversified portfolio that includes first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and, to a lesser extent, equity by targeting an investment size of $10 million to $50 million in securities, on average, of middle-market companies. We expect this investment size to vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. The companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, are not rated by national rating agencies. If such unrated companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard & Poor’s system) from the national rating agencies. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as “leveraged loans”, “high yield” securities or “junk bonds” and are often higher risk compared to debt instruments that are rated above investment grade and have speculative characteristics. In addition, we expect our debt investments to range in maturity from three to ten years.
 5


Over time, we expect that our portfolio will continue to consist primarily of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and, to a lesser extent, equity investments in qualifying assets such as private, or thinly traded or small market-capitalization, U.S. middle-market public companies. In addition, we may invest up to 30% of our portfolio in non-qualifying assets. These non-qualifying assets may include investments in public companies whose securities are not thinly traded or have a market capitalization of greater than $250 million, securities of middle-market companies located outside of the United States and investment companies as defined in the 1940 Act. We may acquire investments in the secondary markets. See “Regulation—Qualifying Assets” and “Investment Selection Criteria” for more information.
 
Our board of directors has the authority to modify or waive certain of our operating policies and strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval (except as required by the 1940 Act). However, absent stockholder approval, under the 1940 Act we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies would have on our business, operating results and value of our common stock. Nevertheless, the effects of changes to our operating policies and strategies may adversely affect our business, our ability to make distributions and the value of our common stock.
 
First Lien Secured Debt
 
Structurally, first lien secured debt ranks senior in priority of payment to second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity, and benefits from a senior security interest in the assets of the borrower. As such, other creditors rank junior to our investments in these securities in the event of insolvency. Due to its lower risk profile and often more restrictive covenants as compared to second lien secured debt and subordinated debt, first lien secured debt generally earns a lower return than second lien secured debt and subordinated debt. In some cases first lien secured debt lenders receive opportunities to invest directly in the equity securities of borrowers and from time to time may also receive warrants to purchase equity securities. We evaluate these investment opportunities on a case-by-case basis.
Second Lien Secured Debt
 
Second lien secured debt usually ranks junior in priority of payment to first lien secured debt. Second lien secured debt holds a second priority with regard to right of payment in the event of insolvency. Second lien secured debt ranks senior to subordinated debt and common and preferred equity in borrowers’ capital structures. Due to its higher risk profile and often less restrictive covenants as compared to first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt generally earns a higher return than first lien secured debt. In many cases, second lien secured debt investors receive opportunities to invest directly in the equity securities of borrowers and from time to time may also receive warrants to purchase equity securities. We evaluate these investment opportunities on a case-by-case basis.
Subordinated Debt
 
Structurally, subordinated debt usually ranks junior in priority of payment to first lien secured debt and second lien secured debt, and are often unsecured. As such, other creditors may rank senior to us in the event of insolvency. Subordinated debt ranks senior to common and preferred equity in borrowers’ capital structures. Due to its higher risk profile and often less restrictive covenants as compared to first lien secured debt and second lien secured debt, subordinated debt generally earns a higher return than first lien secured debt and second lien secured debt. In many cases, subordinated debt investors receive opportunities to invest directly in the equity securities of borrowers, and from time to time, may also receive warrants to purchase equity securities. We evaluate these investment opportunities on a case-by-case basis.
Investment Selection Criteria
 We are committed to a value-oriented philosophy used by the senior investment professionals who manage our portfolio and seek to minimize the risk of capital loss without foregoing potential for capital appreciation.
 We have identified several criteria, discussed below, that we believe are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies. These criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions. However, we caution that not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company in which we choose to invest. Generally, we seek to use our experience and access to market information to identify investment opportunities and to structure investments efficiently and effectively.
  
a) | Leading and defensible competitive market positions
---+----------------------------------------------------

 The Investment Adviser invests in portfolio companies that it believes have developed strong positions within their markets. The Investment Adviser also seeks to invest in portfolio companies that it believes possess competitive advantages, for example, in scale, scope, customer loyalty, product pricing or product quality as compared to their competitors to protect their market position.
  
b) | Investing in stable borrowers with positive cash flow
---+------------------------------------------------------

 Our investment philosophy places a premium on fundamental analysis and has a distinct value-orientation. The Investment Adviser invests in portfolio companies it believes to be stable and well-established, with strong cash flows and profitability. The Investment Adviser believes these attributes indicate portfolio companies that may be well-positioned to maintain consistent cash flow to service and repay their liabilities and maintain growth in their businesses or their relative market share. The Investment Adviser currently does not expect to invest significantly in start-up companies, companies in turnaround situations or companies with speculative business plans, although we are permitted to do so.
  
c) | Proven management teams
---+------------------------

 The Investment Adviser focuses on investments in which the portfolio company has an experienced management team with an established track record of success. The Investment Adviser typically requires that portfolio companies have in place proper incentives to align management’s goals with our goals, including having equity interests.
  
d) | Financial sponsorship
---+----------------------

 The Investment Adviser may seek to cause us to participate in transactions sponsored by what it believes to be trusted financial sponsors. The Investment Adviser believes that a financial sponsor’s willingness to invest significant equity capital in a portfolio company is an implicit endorsement of the quality of that portfolio company. Further, financial sponsors of portfolio companies with significant investments at risk may have the ability, and a strong incentive, to contribute additional capital in difficult economic times should financial or operational issues arise so as to maintain their ownership position.
  
e) | Investments in different borrowers, industries and geographies
---+---------------------------------------------------------------

 The Investment Adviser seeks to invest our assets broadly among portfolio companies, across industries and geographical regions. The Investment Adviser believes that this approach may reduce the risk that a downturn in any one portfolio company, industry or geographical region will have a disproportionate impact on the value of our portfolio, although we are permitted to be non-diversified under the 1940 Act.
 6


 
f) | Viable exit strategy
---+---------------------

 The Investment Adviser seeks to invest in portfolio companies that it believes will provide a steady stream of cash flow to repay our loans while also reinvesting in their respective businesses. The Investment Adviser expects that such internally generated cash flow, leading to the payment of interest on, and the repayment of the principal of, our investments in portfolio companies to be a key means by which we will exit from our investments over time. In addition, the Investment Adviser also seeks to invest in portfolio companies whose business models and expected future cash flows offer attractive exit possibilities. These companies include candidates for strategic acquisition by other industry participants and companies that may repay our investments through an initial public offering of common stock, refinancing or other capital markets transaction.
 Due Diligence
 We believe it is critical to conduct extensive due diligence in evaluating new investment targets. Our Investment Adviser conducts a rigorous due diligence process that is applied to prospective portfolio companies and draws from our Investment Adviser’s experience, industry expertise and network of contacts. In conducting due diligence, our Investment Adviser uses information provided by companies, financial sponsors and publicly available information as well as information from relationships with former and current management teams, consultants, competitors and investment bankers.
 Our due diligence may include:
  
• | review of historical and prospective financial information;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | research relating to the portfolio company’s management, industry, markets, products and services and competitors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | interviews with management, employees, customers and vendors of the potential portfolio company;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | on-site visits;
--+----------------


• | review of loan documents; and
--+------------------------------


• | background checks.
--+-------------------

 Additional due diligence with respect to any investment may be conducted on our behalf by attorneys and accountants prior to the closing of the investment, as well as other outside advisers, as appropriate.
 Upon the completion of due diligence on a portfolio company, the team leading the investment presents the investment opportunity to our Investment Adviser’s investment committee. This committee determines whether to pursue the potential investment. All new investments are required to be reviewed by the investment committee of our Investment Adviser. The members of the investment committee receive no compensation from us. Rather, they are employees of and receive compensation from our Investment Adviser.
 Investment Structure
 Once we determine that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, we work with the management of that portfolio company and its other capital providers, including senior, junior and equity capital providers, to structure an investment. We negotiate with these parties to agree on how our investment is structured relative to the other capital in the portfolio company’s capital structure.
 We expect our first lien secured debt to have terms of three to ten years. We generally obtain security interests in the assets of our portfolio companies that will serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral may take the form of first priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company.
 Typically, our second lien secured debt and subordinated debt investments have maturities of three to ten years. Second lien secured debt and subordinated debt may take the form of a second priority lien on the assets of a portfolio company and have interest-only payments in the early years with cash or payment-in-kind, or PIK, payments with amortization of principal deferred to the later years. In some cases, we may invest in debt securities that, by their terms, convert into equity or additional debt securities or defer payments of interest for the first few years after our investment. Also, in some cases, our second lien secured debt and subordinated debt may be collateralized by a subordinated lien on some or all of the assets of the borrower.
 We seek to tailor the terms of the investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its profitability. For example, in addition to seeking a senior position in the capital structure of our portfolio companies, we seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by:
  
• | requiring a total return on our investments (including both interest in the form of a floor and potential equity appreciation) that compensates us for credit risk;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | incorporating “put” rights and call protection into the investment structure; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with our focus of preserving capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or participation rights.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our investments may include equity features, such as direct investments in the equity securities of borrowers or warrants or options to buy a minority interest in a portfolio company. Any warrants we may receive with our debt securities generally require only a nominal cost to exercise, so as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from these equity investments. We may structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the portfolio company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also obtain registration rights in connection with these equity investments, which may include demand and “piggyback” registration rights.
 We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but we may exit certain investments earlier when a liquidity event, such as the sale or refinancing of a portfolio company, takes place. We also may turn over investments to better position the portfolio in light of market conditions.

Ongoing Relationships with Portfolio Companies
 Monitoring
 The Investment Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Investment Adviser also monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each portfolio company.
 The Investment Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following:
  
• | assessment of success in adhering to a portfolio company’s business plan and compliance with covenants;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | comparisons to other portfolio companies in the industry, if any;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | attendance at and participation in board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of periodic financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Investment Adviser monitors credit risk of each portfolio company regularly with a goal toward identifying early, and when able and appropriate, exiting investments with potential credit problems. This monitoring process may include reviewing: (1) a portfolio company’s financial resources and operating history; (2) comparing a portfolio company’s current operating results with the Investment Adviser’s initial thesis for the investment and its expectations for the performance of the investment; (3) a portfolio company’s sensitivity to economic conditions; (4) the performance of a portfolio company’s management; (5) a portfolio company’s debt maturities and capital requirements; (6) a portfolio company’s interest and asset coverage; and (7) the relative value of an investment based on a portfolio company’s anticipated cash flow.

Our executive officers and directors, as well as the senior investment professionals of the Investment Adviser and Administrator, may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do. Currently, the executive officers and directors, as well as certain of the current senior investment professionals of the Investment Adviser and Administrator, serve as officers and directors of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd., a publicly traded BDC, and other managed funds, as applicable. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which obligations might not be in the best interest of us or our stockholders. In addition, we note that any affiliated investment vehicle currently existing, or formed in the future, and managed by the Investment Adviser and or its affiliates may, notwithstanding different stated investment objectives, have overlapping investment objectives with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. As a result, the Investment Adviser may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities among us and such other entities. The Investment Adviser will allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner consistent with our allocation policy, and we have received exemptive relief with respect to certain co-investment transactions. Where co-investment is unavailable or inappropriate, the Investment Adviser will choose which investment fund should receive the allocation. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business and Structure—There are significant potential conflicts of interest which could impact our investment returns” for more information.
 We may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the securities and instruments of other investment companies and companies that would be investment companies but are excluded from the definition of an investment company provided in Section 3(c) of the 1940 Act. We may also co-invest in the future on a concurrent basis with our affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable regulations, our trade allocation procedures and, if applicable, the terms of our exemptive relief.
 Investment Management Agreement
 We have entered into an agreement with the Investment Adviser, or the Investment Management Agreement, under which the Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to, us. Mr. Penn, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is the managing member and a senior investment professional of, and has a financial and controlling interest in, PennantPark Investment Advisers. PennantPark Investment, through the Investment Adviser, provides similar services to SBIC II under its respective investment management agreement. Such investment management agreement does not affect the management or incentive fees that we pay to the Investment Adviser on a consolidated basis. Under the terms of our Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Adviser:

• | determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | closes and monitors the investments we make; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services, as we may need from time to time.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 PennantPark Investment Advisers’ services under our Investment Management Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services, without the prior approval of our stockholders or our board of directors, to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. Our board of directors monitors for any potential conflicts that may arise upon such a development. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives a fee from us, consisting of two components—a base management fee and an incentive fee or, collectively, Management Fees.

Management Fees
 Effective January 1, 2018, the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% of our “average adjusted gross assets,” which equals our gross assets (exclusive of U.S. Treasury Bills, temporary draws under any credit facility, cash and cash equivalents, repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions undertaken at the end of a fiscal quarter for purposes of preserving investment flexibility for the next quarter and unfunded commitments, if any) and is payable quarterly in arrears. In addition, on November 13, 2018, in connection with our board of directors’ approval of the application of the modified asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act to the Company, our board of directors also approved an amendment to the Investment Advisory Agreement reducing the Investment Adviser’s annual base management fee from 1.50% to 1.00% on gross assets that exceed 200% of the Company’s total net assets as of the immediately preceding quarter-end. This amendment became effective on February 5, 2019 with the amendment and restatement of the Investment Management Agreement on April 12, 2019. The base management fee is calculated based on the average adjusted gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. For example, if we sold shares on the 45th day of a quarter and did not use the proceeds from the sale to repay outstanding indebtedness, our gross assets for such quarter would give effect to the net proceeds of the issuance for only 45 days of the quarter during which the additional shares were outstanding. For periods prior to January 1, 2018, the base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 2.00% of our “average adjusted gross assets”. From December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2017, the Investment Adviser voluntarily agreed, in consultation with the board of directors, to irrevocably waive 16% of base management fees, correlated to our 16% energy exposure (oil & gas and energy & utilities industries) at cost as of December 31, 2015. For the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Investment Adviser earned base management fees of $18.2 million, $16.5 million (after a waiver of $0.9 million) and $20.3 million (after a waiver of $3.9 million), respectively, from us. 
 The following is a hypothetical example of the calculation of average adjusted gross assets:
 Gross assets as of December 31, 20XX = $160 million
 U.S. Treasury bills and temporary draws on credit facilities as of December 31, 20XX = $10 million
 Adjusted gross assets as of December 31, 20XX = $150 million
 Gross assets as of March 31, 20XX = $200 million
 U.S. Treasury bills and temporary draws on credit facilities as of March 31, 20XX = $20 million
 Adjusted gross assets as of March 31, 20XX = $180 million
 Average value of adjusted gross assets as of March 31, 20XX and December 31, 20XX, which are the two immediately preceding calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter equals ($150 million + $180 million) / 2 = $165 million.
 The incentive fee has two parts, as follows:
 
One part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income, including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as amendment, commitment, origination, prepayment penalties, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees received from portfolio companies, accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below), and any interest expense or amendment fees under any credit facilities and distribution paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, or OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, computed net of all realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a percentage of the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the hurdle rate of 1.75% per quarter (7.00% annualized). Effective January 1, 2018, we pay the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in each calendar quarter as follows: (1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.75%, (2) 100% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1212% in any calendar quarter (8.4848% annualized), and (3) 17.5% of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds 2.1212% in any calendar quarter. These calculations are pro-rated for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter, if applicable. For periods prior to January 1, 2018, we paid the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in each calendar quarter as follows: (1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income did not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.75%, (2) 100% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeded the hurdle rate but was less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized), and (3) 20% of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeded 2.1875% in any calendar quarter. From December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2017, the Investment Adviser voluntarily agreed, in consultation with the board of directors, to irrevocably waive 16% of incentive fees, correlated to our 16% energy cost exposure (oil & gas and energy & utilities industries) at cost as of December 31, 2015. For the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Investment Adviser earned $5.1 million, $11.0 million (after a waiver of $0.5 million) and $9.3 million (after a waiver of $1.8 million), respectively, in incentive fees on net investment income from us.
 The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of quarterly incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income:
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
 (expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets)
 
Percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
 allocated to income-related portion of incentive fee
 
The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Management Agreement, as of the termination date) and, effective January 1, 2018, equals 17.5% of our realized capital gains (20.0% for periods prior to January 1, 2018), if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. For the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Investment Adviser did not accrue an incentive fee on capital gains as calculated under the Investment Management Agreement (as described above).
 
10


Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we are required to accrue a capital gains incentive fee based upon net realized capital gains and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the capital gains incentive fee accrual, we considered the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Management Agreement. This accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and cumulative unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then we record a capital gains incentive fee equal to 17.5% of such amount (20.0% for periods prior to January 1, 2018), less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains related to incentive fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such year. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. For the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Investment Adviser did not accrue an incentive fee on capital gains as calculated under GAAP.
 Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation
 Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee (*):
 Alternative 1:
 Assumptions
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25%
 Hurdle (1) = 1.75%
 Base management fee (2) = 0.375%
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20%
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
 (investment income—(base management fee + other expenses)) = 0.675%
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle; therefore, there is no incentive fee.
 Alternative 2:
 Assumptions
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.70%
 Hurdle (1) = 1.75%
 Base management fee (2) = 0.375%
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20%
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
 (investment income—(base management fee + other expenses)) = 2.125%
 
 
Incentive fee | = 17.5% x Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, subject to “catch-up”
--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | = 2.125% - 1.75% 
 | = 0.375% 
 | = 100% x 0.375% 
 | = 0.375% 

Alternative 3:
 Assumptions
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.00%
 Hurdle (1) = 1.75%
 Base management fee (2) = 0.375%
 11


Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20%
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
 (investment income—(base management fee + other expenses)) = 2.425%
 
 
Incentive fee | = 17.5% x Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, subject to “catch-up” (3) 
--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Incentive fee | = 100% x “catch-up” + (17.5% x (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income - 2.1212%))
Catch-up | = 2.1212% - 1.75% 
 | = 0.3712% 
 | = (100% x 0.3712%) + (17.5% x (2.425% - 2.1212%)) 
 | = 0.3712% + (17.5% x 0.3038%) 
 | = 0.3712% + 0.053165% 
 | = 0.424365% 


* | The hypothetical amount of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income shown is based on a percentage of total net assets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(1) | Represents 7.0% annualized hurdle.
----+-----------------------------------


(2) | Represents 1.5% annualized base management fee.
----+------------------------------------------------


(3) | The “catch-up” provision is intended to provide the Investment Adviser with an incentive fee of 17.5% on all of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 2.1212% in any calendar quarter.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee:
 Assumptions
 Year 1 = no net realized capital gains or losses
 Year 2 = 6% realized capital gains and 1% realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation, capital gain incentive fee = 17.5% x (realized capital gains for year computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation at year end)

Year 1 incentive fee | = 17.5% x (0) 
---------------------+--------------------
 | = 0 
 | = no incentive fee 
Year 2 incentive fee | = 17.5% x (6% - 1%)
 | = 17.5% x 5% 
 | = 0.875% 

 
Organization of the Investment Adviser
 PennantPark Investment Advisers is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act. The principal executive office of PennantPark Investment Advisers is located at 590 Madison Avenue, 15th Floor, New York, NY 10022.
 Duration and Termination of Investment Management Agreement
 
The Investment Management Agreement was reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser, in February 2019 and subsequently amended and restated in April 2019, as approved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us or our Investment Adviser. Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Investment Management Agreement will continue in effect for a period of one year through February 2020. It will remain in effect if approved annually by our board of directors, or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser. In determining to reapprove the Investment Management Agreement, our board of directors requested information from the Investment Adviser that enabled it to evaluate a number of factors relevant to its determination. These factors included the nature, quality and extent of services performed by the Investment Adviser, the Investment Adviser’s ability to manage conflicts of interest effectively, our short and long-term performance, our costs, including as compared to comparable externally and internally managed publicly traded BDCs that engage in similar investing activities, the Investment Adviser’s profitability, any economies of scale, and any other benefits of the relationship for the Investment Adviser. Based on the information reviewed and the considerations detailed above, our board of directors, including all of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser, concluded that the investment advisory fee rates and terms are fair and reasonable in relation to the services provided and reapproved the Investment Management Agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders.
 The Investment Management Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Investment Management Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business and Structure—We are dependent upon our Investment Adviser’s key personnel for our future success, and if our Investment Adviser is unable to hire and retain qualified personnel or if our Investment Adviser loses any member of its management team, our ability to achieve our investment objectives could be significantly harmed” for more information.
 Administration Agreement
 We have entered into an agreement, or the Administration Agreement, with the Administrator, under which the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services. Under our Administration Agreement, the Administrator performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include, among other activities, being responsible for the financial records we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Administrator assists us in determining and publishing our NAV, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. PennantPark Investment, through the Administrator, provides similar services to SBIC II under its administration agreement with us. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for its allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, technology systems, insurance and our allocable portion of the cost of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs. The Administrator also offers on our behalf, significant managerial assistance to portfolio companies to which we are required to offer such assistance. To the extent that our Administrator outsources any of its functions, we will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without profit to the Administrator. Reimbursement for certain of these costs is included in administrative services expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we reimbursed the Investment Adviser approximately $1.8 million, $2.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively, including expenses the Investment Adviser incurred on behalf of the Administrator for services described above.

Duration and Termination of Administration Agreement
 The Administration Agreement was reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us, in February 2019. Unless terminated earlier as described below, our Administration Agreement will continue in effect for a period of one year through February 2020. It will remain in effect if approved annually by our board of directors, or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us. The Administration Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the consent of the other party. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other.
Indemnification
 Our Investment Management Agreement and Administration Agreement provide that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their duties and obligations, PennantPark Investment Advisers and PennantPark Investment Administration and their officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with them are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of PennantPark Investment Advisers’ and PennantPark Investment Administration’s services under our Investment Management Agreement or Administration Agreement or otherwise as Investment Adviser or Administrator for us.
License Agreement

Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the “PennantPark” name.
REGULATION
 Business Development Company, Regulated Investment Company Regulations and Small Business Investment Company Regulations
 We are a BDC under the 1940 Act, which has qualified and intends to continue to qualify to maintain an election to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between a BDC and its affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities.
 We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an “underwriter” as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. We may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of securities we own or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any registered investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one registered investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one registered investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. We may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate and currency fluctuations. None of these policies are fundamental and they may be changed without stockholder approval.
 Qualifying Assets
 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDC’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following:

(1) | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined under the 1940 Act to include any issuer which:
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(a) | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly-owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but is excluded from the definition of an investment company by Section 3(c) of the 1940 Act; and
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | satisfies any of the following:
----+--------------------------------


(i) | does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | has any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange subject to a maximum market capitalization of $250.0 million; or
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | is controlled by a BDC, either alone or as part of a group acting together, and such BDC in fact exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of such eligible portfolio company and, as a result of such control, has an affiliated person who is a director of such eligible portfolio company.
------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control.

In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above.
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
 As a BDC, we are required to make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies that constitute a qualifying asset within the meaning of Section 2(a)(47) of the 1940 Act. However, if a BDC purchases securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such significant managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. Our Administrator may provide such assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request such assistance. Officers of our Investment Adviser and Administrator may provide assistance to controlled affiliates.
Temporary Investments
 Pending investments in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. We may invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the Diversification Tests, as defined below under “Regulation—Election to be Treated as a RIC,” in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Investment Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we may enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Senior Securities
 We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act and referred to as the asset coverage ratio, is compliant with the 1940 Act, immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage requirement at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to our asset coverage ratio. We received exemptive relief from the SEC allowing us to modify the asset coverage requirement to exclude the SBA debentures from the calculation. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business and Structure—Regulations governing our operation as a BDC will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital” for more information.
Joint Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct
 We and PennantPark Investment Advisers have adopted a joint code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and a code of conduct that establish procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the codes’ requirements. Our joint code of ethics and code of conduct are available, free of charge, on our website at www.pennantpark.com. In addition, the joint code of ethics is attached as an exhibit to this Report and is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s Internet site at www.sec.gov. You may also obtain a copy of our joint code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following email address: publicinfo@sec.gov.
 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Investment Adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of our Investment Adviser are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by our Investment Adviser and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures described below, “we,” “our” and “us” refer to our Investment Adviser.
Introduction
 As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, we have a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of our clients. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of our clients.
 These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
 Proxy Policies
 We vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what we perceive to be the best interests of our stockholders. We review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by our clients. Although we will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our clients’ portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so.
 Our proxy voting decisions are made by the senior investment professionals who are responsible for monitoring each of our clients’ investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
 Proxy Voting Records
 You may obtain information about how we voted proxies, free of charge, by calling us collect at (212) 905-1000 or by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Aviv Efrat, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, 590 Madison Avenue, 15th Floor, New York, New York 10022.

Privacy Protection Principles
 We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties.
 Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain non-public personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third party administrator).
 We restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to employees of our Investment Adviser and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders.
 Our privacy protection policies are available, free of charge, on our website at www.pennantpark.com. In addition, the privacy policy is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s Internet site at www.sec.gov, filed as an exhibit to our annual report on Form 10-K (File No. 814-00736, filed on November 16, 2011).
 Other
 We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us, and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC.
 We will be periodically examined by the SEC and SBA for compliance with the 1940 Act and 1958 Act, respectively.
 We are required by law to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
 We and PennantPark Investment Advisers have each adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws. We review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and we designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, imposes several regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us.
 For example:
  
• | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated there-under. We continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and continue to take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance with that act.
 Election to be Treated as a RIC
 We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually to maintain our election to be treated, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC tax election, we must, among other requirements, meet certain annual source-of-income and quarterly asset diversification requirements (as described below). We also must annually distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of the sum of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, or investment company taxable income, and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid out of the assets legally available for distribution, or the Annual Distribution Requirement.
 In order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, we must:
  
• | maintain an election to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain qualified publicly traded partnerships or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, or the 90% Income Test; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | diversify our holdings, or the Diversification Tests, so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1) | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer neither represents more than 5% of the value of our assets nor more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in certain qualified publicly traded partnerships.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 15


Although not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute in respect of each calendar year dividends to our stockholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (subject to certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (i.e., the excess, if any, of our capital gains over capital losses), adjusted for certain ordinary losses, generally for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year plus (3) any net ordinary income or capital gain net income for the preceding years that was not distributed during such years on which we did not incur any corporate income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. Although we may distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above, we may retain and incur tax on such net capital gains or investment company taxable income, subject to maintaining our ability to be treated as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, in order to provide us with additional liquidity.
 While we intend to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to avoid incurring any material U.S. federal excise tax on our earnings, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, distribute amounts sufficient to avoid the imposition of the tax entirely. In that event, we generally will be liable for the excise tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. Under certain circumstances, however, we may, in our sole discretion, determine that it is in our best interests to retain a portion of our income or capital gains rather than distribute such amount as dividends and accordingly cause us to bear the excise tax burden associated therewith.
 We may invest in partnerships which may result in our being subject to additional state, local or foreign income, franchise or other tax liabilities. In addition, some of the income and fees that we may recognize will not satisfy the 90% Income Test. In order to mitigate the risk that such income and fees would disqualify us as a RIC as a result of a failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may be required to recognize such income and fees indirectly through the Taxable Subsidiaries, which are classified as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Taxable Subsidiaries generally will be subject to corporate income taxes on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees.
 Taxation as a RIC
 If we qualify as a RIC, and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gains, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to stockholders. Additionally, upon satisfying these requirements, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any investment company taxable income or net capital gains, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, that is not distributed (or not deemed to have been distributed) as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders.
 We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold a debt instrument that is treated under applicable tax rules as having OID (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each taxable year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the debt instrument, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any OID accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income in the taxable year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount.
 We invest in below investment grade instruments. Investments in these types of instruments may present special tax issues for us. U.S. federal income tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as when we may cease to accrue interest, OID or market discount, when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless debt instruments, how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and income and whether exchanges of debt instruments in a bankruptcy or workout context are taxable. We will address these and other issues to the extent necessary in order to continue to maintain our qualification to be subject to tax as a RIC.
 Gain or loss realized by us from equity securities and warrants acquired by us, as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants, generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.
 We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy our Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt instruments and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain asset coverage requirements are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
 We may distribute our common stock as a dividend from our taxable income and a stockholder could receive a portion of such distributions declared and distributed by us in shares of our common stock with the remaining amount in cash. A stockholder will be considered to have recognized dividend income generally equal to the fair market value of the stock paid by us plus cash received with respect to such dividend. The total dividend declared and distributed by us would be taxable income to a stockholder even though only a small portion of the dividend was paid in cash to pay any taxes due on the total dividend. We have not yet elected to distribute stock as a dividend but reserve the right to do so.
 Failure to Qualify as a RIC
 If we fail to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, unless certain cure provisions of the Code apply, we will be subject to tax in that taxable year on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any dividend distributions to our stockholders. In that case, all of our income will be subject to corporate-level federal income tax, reducing the amount available to be distributed to our stockholders. In contrast, assuming we qualify as a RIC, our corporate-level federal income tax should be substantially reduced or eliminated. See “Election to be Treated as a RIC” above for more information.
 If we are unable to maintain our status as a RIC, we also would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would distributions be required to be made. Distributions would generally be taxable as dividends to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, U.S. non-corporate stockholders generally would be eligible to treat such dividends as “qualified dividend income,” which generally would be subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax, and dividends paid by us to certain U.S. corporate stockholders would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis in our common stock, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. Moreover, if we fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, to qualify again to be treated as a RIC for federal income tax purposes in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to distribute our earnings and profits attributable to any of our non-RIC taxable years as dividends to our stockholders. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two consecutive taxable years, to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (that is, the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had sold the property at fair market value at the end of the taxable year) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five taxable years.

SBA Regulations
 SBIC II is licensed under the SBA as a SBIC under Section 301(c) of the 1958 Act and received its license in 2013. During the year ended September 30, 2019, we liquidated and dissolved SBIC I.
 SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of capital to businesses that meet specified eligibility requirements discussed below. Under SBA regulations, SBIC II is subject to regulatory requirements including making investments in SBA eligible businesses, investing at least 25% of regulatory capital in eligible smaller businesses, placing certain limitations on the financing terms of investments, prohibiting investing in certain industries, and required capitalization thresholds among other regulations. Furthermore, SBIC II is subject to periodic audits and examinations of their financial statements that are prepared on a basis of accounting other than GAAP pursuant to SBA accounting standards and financial reporting requirements for SBICs. For example, SBIC II does not use fair value accounting on its assets or liabilities under SBA valuation guidelines. If SBIC II fails to comply with applicable SBA regulations, the SBA could, depending on the severity of the violation, limit or prohibit use of debentures, declare outstanding debentures immediately due and payable, and/or limit SBIC II from making new investments. In addition, the SBA can revoke or suspend a license for willful or repeated violation of, or willful or repeated failure to observe, any provision of the 1958 Act or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder. These actions by the SBA would, in turn, negatively affect us.
 Eligible Small and Smaller Businesses
 Under present SBA regulations, eligible small business include businesses that (together with their affiliates) have tangible net worth not exceeding $19.5 million and have average annual net income of $6.5 million for the two most recent fiscal years. In addition, SBIC II must invest at least 25% of investments in “smaller” concerns. A smaller concern is a business that has tangible net worth not exceeding $6.0 million and has average annual net income not exceeding $2.0 million for the two most recent fiscal years or, as an alternative to the aforementioned requirement, meet the size requirements based on either the number of employees or gross revenue, which is based on the industry in which the smaller concern operates. Once an SBIC has invested in a company, it may continue to make follow-on investments in the company, regardless of the size of the business, up and until the time a business offers its securities in a public market.
Financing Limitations, Terms and Changes in Control
 The SBA prohibits an SBIC from financing small businesses in certain industries such as relending, gambling, oil and gas exploration and other passive businesses. Additional SBA prohibitions include investing outside the United States, investing more than 30% of regulatory capital in one company and lending money to any officer, director or employee or to invest in any affiliate thereof. The SBA places certain limits on the financing terms of investments by SBIC II in portfolio companies such as limiting the interest rate on debt securities and loans provided to portfolio companies. The SBA also limits fees, prepayment terms and other economic arrangements that are typically charged in lending arrangements.
 The SBA also prohibits, without prior written approval, a “change in control” of SBIC II or transfers that would result in any person or group owning 10% or more of a class of capital stock (or its equivalent in the case of a partnership) of a licensed SBIC. A “change of control” is any event which would result in the transfer of power, direct or indirect, to direct management and policies of an SBIC, whether through ownership, contractual arrangements or otherwise.
 Idle Funds Limitation
 The SBA limits an SBIC to investing idle funds in the following types of securities:
  
• | direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. Government, which mature within 15 months from the date of the investment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | repurchase agreements with federally insured institutions with a maturity of seven days or less (and the securities underlying the repurchase obligations must be direct obligations of or guaranteed by the federal government);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | certificates of deposit with a maturity of one year or less, issued by a federally insured institution; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a deposit account in a federally insured institution that is subject to withdrawal restriction of one year or less.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 SBA Leverage or Debentures
 SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse to us, have a 10-year maturity, and may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed at the time of issuance at a market-driven spread over 10-year U.S. Treasury Notes. Leverage through SBA-guaranteed debentures is subject to required capitalization thresholds. SBA current regulations limit the amount that an SBIC may borrow to a maximum of $175.0 million, which is up to twice its regulatory capital, and a maximum of $350.0 million as part of a group of SBICs under common control.
