 Item 1. Business
Overview
DiamondRock Hospitality Company is a lodging-focused Maryland corporation operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2018, we owned a portfolio of 31 premium hotels and resorts that contain 10,091 guest rooms located in 21 different markets in North America and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our hotel in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Frenchman's Reef & Morning Star Beach Resort ("Frenchman's Reef"), is currently closed due to damage incurred by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017.

As an owner, rather than an operator, of lodging properties, we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by our hotels after the payment of fees due to hotel managers and hotel brands, which are calculated based on the revenues and profitability of each hotel. 
Our goal is to deliver long-term stockholder returns, that exceed those generated by our peers, through a combination of dividends and enduring capital appreciation. Our strategy is to utilize disciplined capital allocation, focus on high quality lodging properties in North American urban and resort markets with superior growth prospects and high barriers-to-entry, aggressively asset manage those hotels, and employ conservative amounts of leverage. 
Our primary business is to acquire, own, asset manage and renovate premium hotel properties in the United States. Our portfolio is concentrated in key gateway cities and destination resort locations. Each of our hotels is managed by a third party—either an independent operator or a brand operator, such as Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”). 
We critically evaluate each of our hotels to ensure that we own a portfolio of hotels that conforms to our vision, supports our mission and corresponds with our strategy. On a regular basis, we analyze our portfolio to identify opportunities to invest capital in certain projects or market non-core assets for sale in order to increase our portfolio quality. We are committed to a conservative capital structure with prudent leverage. We regularly assess the availability and affordability of capital in order to maximize stockholder value and minimize enterprise risk. In addition, we are committed to following sound corporate governance practices and to being open and transparent in our communications with our stockholders.
Our Company
We commenced operations in July 2004 and became a public reporting company in May 2005. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “DRH”. We have been successful in acquiring, financing and asset managing our hotels. As of December 31, 2018, we had 31 full-time employees. Since our formation, we have sought to be forthright and transparent in our communications with investors, to actively monitor our corporate overhead and to adopt sound corporate governance practices. 
 Our Business Strategy
Our business strategy is to utilize disciplined capital allocation, mainly focused on owning high quality lodging properties in North American markets with superior growth prospects and high barriers-to-entry, and aggressively asset manage those hotels and employ conservative amounts of leverage. 
We plan to strategically allocate capital in order to create value depending on our cost of capital. If our cost of capital is attractive, we expect to:

• | pursue strategic acquisitions;


• | consider opportunistically raising equity; and


• | evaluate opportunities to dispose of non-core hotels.

If we believe our cost of capital is elevated, we expect to create value over the long term to stockholders by deploying investment capacity into share repurchases.
We prefer a relatively efficient capital structure and have not invested in joint ventures or issued preferred stock. We structure our hotel acquisitions to be straightforward and to fit within our conservative capital structure; however, we will consider a more complex transaction (e.g. the issuance of operating partnership units to limited partners) if we believe that the projected returns to our stockholders will significantly exceed the returns that would otherwise be available.
High-Quality Urban and Destination Resort Hotels
As of December 31, 2018, we owned 31 premium hotels and resorts throughout North America and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our hotels and resorts are primarily categorized as upper upscale as defined by Smith Travel Research and are generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets with multiple demand generators. Our properties are concentrated in key gateway cities and in resort destinations. We consider lodging properties located in gateway cities and resort destinations to be the most capable of generating dynamic cash flow growth and achieving superior long-term capital appreciation.
-5-

We have enhanced our hotel portfolio by recycling capital from non-core hotels, located in slower growth markets, to higher quality hotels located primarily in high-growth urban and destination resort markets. We have repositioned our portfolio through the acquisition of urban and resort hotels that align with our strategic goals while disposing of non-core hotels. These acquisitions increased our urban exposure with acquisitions in cities such as San Diego, San Francisco, Boston, Denver, and Washington, D.C. Our resort exposure increased with acquisitions in locations such as Key West and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Sedona, Arizona, and Sausalito, Huntington Beach and South Lake Tahoe, California. Five of our last six acquisitions have been resort destination hotels. Over 90% of our portfolio EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 is derived from core urban and resort destination hotels. Our capital recycling program has also achieved several other important strategic portfolio goals that include improving our portfolio’s geographic, operator and brand diversity. 
We are highly sensitive to our cost of capital and may pursue acquisitions that create value in the near term. We will continue to evaluate our portfolio for opportunities to continue to upgrade our portfolio by considering strategic acquisitions and opportunistic non-core hotel dispositions.
The primary focus of our acquisitions over the past eight years was on hotels that we believe presented unique value-add opportunities. In addition, we have repositioned certain of our hotels through a change in brand, comprehensive renovation and/or change in third-party hotel manager to a more efficient operator. This focus has helped us achieve the strategic goals of improving our portfolio's brand and management diversity. 
We evaluate each hotel in our portfolio to assess the optimal brand and management strategy for the individual hotel and market. We leverage the leading global hotel brands at most of our hotels, which are flagged under a brand owned by Marriott or Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. ("Hilton"). We also maintain a portion of our hotels as independent lifestyle hotels. We believe that premier global hotel brands create significant value as a result of each brand's ability to produce incremental revenue through their strong reservation and rewards systems and sales organizations. We are also interested in owning non-branded hotels located in premier or unique markets where we believe that the returns on such a hotel may be higher than if the hotel were operated under a globally-recognized brand.
Innovative Asset Management
We believe that we can create significant value in our portfolio through innovative asset management strategies such as rebranding, renovating and repositioning our hotels. We regularly evaluate our portfolio to determine if there are opportunities to employ these value-add strategies. 
Our asset management team is focused on improving hotel profit margins through revenue management strategies and cost control programs. Our asset management team also focuses on identifying new and potential value creation opportunities across our portfolio, including implementing resort and other fees, creating incremental guest rooms, leasing out restaurants to more profitable third-party operators, converting under-utilized space to revenue-generating meeting space and implementing programs to reduce energy consumption and increase labor efficiency. 
Our senior management team has established a broad network of hotel industry contacts and relationships, including relationships with hotel owners, financiers, operators, project managers and contractors and other key industry participants. We use our broad network of hotel industry contacts and relationships to maximize the value of our hotels. We strive to negotiate management agreements that give us the right to exert influence over the management of our properties, annual budgets and all capital expenditures (all, to the extent permitted under the REIT rules), and then to use those rights to continually monitor and improve the performance of our properties. We cooperatively partner with our hotel managers in an attempt to increase operating results and long-term asset values at our hotels. In addition to working directly with the personnel at our hotels, our senior management team also has long-standing professional relationships with our hotel managers' senior executives, and we work directly with these senior executives to improve the performance of our hotels.
Conservative Capital Structure
We believe that a conservative capital structure maximizes investment capacity while reducing enterprise risk. We currently employ a conservative debt profile and straight-forward capital structure with no preferred equity or convertible bonds. We maintain significant balance sheet flexibility with existing corporate cash, no outstanding borrowings under our $300 million senior unsecured credit facility, and with 23 of our 31 hotels unencumbered by mortgage debt as of December 31, 2018. We are well positioned for potential credit market volatility and uncertainty in the lodging cycle given that we have no near-term debt maturities and the majority of our debt is financed with long-term, fixed-rate mortgages with a well-laddered maturity schedule. We believe it is prudent to reduce the inherent risk of highly cyclical lodging fundamentals through a low leverage capital structure.
-6-

We believe that our strategically designed capital structure is a value creation tool that can be used over the entire lodging cycle. Specifically, we believe that lower leverage benefits us in the following ways:

• | provides capacity to fund attractive acquisitions;


• | enhances our ability to maintain a sustainable dividend;


• | enables us to opportunistically repurchase shares during periods of stock price dislocation; and


• | provides capacity to fund late-cycle capital needs.

As of December 31, 2018, our outstanding debt consists of a combination of property-specific mortgage debt, all of which bears interest at a fixed rate, and unsecured corporate term loans. We prefer that at least half of our portfolio remain unencumbered by debt in order to provide maximum balance sheet flexibility. We expect that our strategy will enable us to maintain a balance sheet with an appropriate amount of debt throughout all phases of the lodging cycle. 
Our Corporate Structure
We conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT, in which our hotels are owned by subsidiaries of our operating partnership, DiamondRock Hospitality Limited Partnership. We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and own either directly or indirectly 99.6% of the limited partnership units (“OP units”) of our operating partnership. The remaining 0.4% of the OP units are held by third parties. These OP units were issued in connection with our acquisition of Cavallo Point, The Lodge at the Golden Gate (“Cavallo Point”), in December 2018. Each OP unit currently owned by holders other than us is redeemable, at the option of the holder, beginning December 12, 2019, for an amount of cash equal to the market value of one share of the Company's common stock or, at our election, one share of the Company's common stock, in each case subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of stock splits, mergers, consolidations or similar pro-rata share transactions. As of December 31, 2018, limited partners held 796,684 OP units. In the future, we may issue additional OP units from time to time in connection with acquiring hotel properties, financing, compensation, or other reasons.
In order for the income from our hotel investments to constitute “rents from real property” for purposes of the gross income tests required for REIT qualification, we must lease each of our hotels to a wholly-owned subsidiary of our taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS (each, a TRS lessee), or to an unrelated third party. We currently lease all of our domestic hotels to TRS lessees. In turn, our TRS lessees must engage a third-party management company to manage the hotels. However, we may structure our properties that are not subject to U.S. federal income tax differently from the structures that we use for our U.S. properties. For example, Frenchman's Reef is held by a U.S. Virgin Islands corporation, which we have elected to be a TRS.
The following chart shows our corporate structure as of the date of this report:

Competition
The hotel industry is highly competitive and our hotels are subject to competition from other hotels for guests. Competition is based on a number of factors, including convenience of location, reputation, brand affiliation, price, range of services, guest amenities, and quality of customer service. Competition is specific to the individual markets in which our properties are located and will include competition from existing and new hotels operated under brands in the full-service, select-service and extended-stay segments. We believe that properties flagged with a Marriott or Hilton brand will enjoy the competitive advantages associated with their operations under such brand. These global brands' reservation systems and national advertising, marketing and promotional services combined with the strong management expertise they provide enable our properties to perform favorably in terms of both occupancy and room rates relative to other brands and non-branded hotels. The guest loyalty programs operated by these global brands generate repeat guest business that might otherwise go to competing hotels. Increased competition may have a material adverse effect on occupancy, Average Daily Rate (or ADR) and Revenue per Available Room (or RevPAR), or may require us to make capital improvements that we otherwise would not undertake, which may result in decreases in the profitability of our hotels.
In addition to competing with traditional hotels and lodging facilities, we compete with alternative lodging, including third-party providers of short-term rental properties and serviced apartments. We compete based on a number of factors, including room rates, quality of accommodations, service levels, convenience of location, reputation, reservation systems, brand recognition and supply and availability of alternative lodging. 
We face competition for the acquisition of hotels from institutional pension funds, private equity funds, REITs, hotel companies and others who are engaged in hotel acquisitions and investments. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial and operational resources than we have and may have greater knowledge of the markets in which we seek to invest. This competition may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us and increase the cost of acquiring our targeted hotel investments.

Seasonality
The periods during which our hotels experience higher revenues vary from property to property, depending principally upon location and the customer base served. Accordingly, we expect some seasonality in our business. Volatility in our financial performance from the seasonality of the lodging industry could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
Regulatory Matters
Environmental Matters
In connection with the ownership of hotels, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under these laws, a current or previous owner or operator (including tenants) of real estate may be liable for the costs or removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, on, under or in such property. These laws typically impose liability without regard to fault or whether or not the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contamination, and the liability under these laws may be joint and several. Because these laws also impose liability on the persons who owned the property at the time it became contaminated, it is possible that we could incur cleanup costs or other environmental liabilities even after we sell properties. The presence of contamination, or the failure to properly remediate contamination, on a property may adversely affect the ability of the owner or operator to sell that property or to borrow funds using such property as collateral. Under the environmental laws, courts and government agencies also have the authority to require that a person who sent waste to a waste disposal facility, such as a landfill or incinerator, pay for the cleanup of that facility if it becomes contaminated and threatens human health or the environment.
Our hotels are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that address a wide variety of issues, including, but not limited to, storage tanks, air emissions from emergency generators, storm water and wastewater discharges, asbestos, lead-based paint, mold and mildew and waste management. Some of our hotels routinely handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations, which substances and wastes are subject to regulation (e.g., swimming pool chemicals). Our hotels incur costs to comply with these laws and regulations and could be subject to fines and penalties for non-compliance.
We believe that our hotels are in compliance, in all material respects, with all federal, state and local environmental ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters, the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on us. We have not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our present properties.
Annually, we submit a response to the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking survey (the “GRESB Report”), which benchmarks the Company's approach and performance on environmental, social and governance indicators against other real estate companies. The GRESB Report is accessible on our website. The information included in, referenced to, or otherwise accessible through the GRESB Report, is not incorporated by reference in, or considered to be a part of, this report or any document unless expressly incorporated by reference therein. 
ADA Regulation
Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA, to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by individuals with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in payment of civil penalties, damages, and attorneys' fees and costs. The obligation to comply with the ADA is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this regard.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 31 full-time employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees is a member of any union; however, the employees of our hotel managers at the Lexington Hotel New York, Courtyard Manhattan/Fifth Avenue, Courtyard Manhattan/Midtown East, Hilton Garden Inn/Times Square, Westin Boston Waterfront, and Hilton Boston Downtown are currently represented by labor unions and are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

Insurance
We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, earthquake, windstorm, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket policy. In addition, we carry earthquake and terrorism insurance on our properties in an amount and with deductibles which we believe are commercially reasonable. We do not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses such as loss from riots, war or acts of God. Certain of the properties in our portfolio are located in areas known to be seismically active or subject to hurricanes and we believe that we have appropriate insurance for those risks, although they are subject to higher deductibles than ordinary property insurance.
Most of our hotel management agreements and mortgage agreements require that we obtain and maintain property insurance, business interruption insurance, flood insurance, earthquake insurance (if the hotel is located in an "earthquake prone zone" as determined by the U.S. Geological Survey) and other customary types of insurance related to hotels. We comply with all such requirements. In addition, either we or the hotel manager are responsible for obtaining general liability insurance, workers' compensation and employer's liability insurance.

Supplemental Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
This summary is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice. This discussion does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders of our securities in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances. 
The following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” in the prospectus dated August 8, 2018 contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on August 8, 2018.
Taxation of the Operating Partnership
Previously, our operating partnership was disregarded as an entity separate from us for U.S. federal income tax purposes but since September 1, 2018, our operating partnership has been treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the discussion under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Taxation of the Operating Partnership” is revised as follows: 

• | The first, fourth and seventh paragraphs are deleted;

-10-


• | The first sentence of the sixth paragraph is revised to state: “We have used and may continue to use our operating partnership to acquire hotels by issuing operating partnership units, in order to permit the sellers of such properties to defer recognition of their tax gain.”; and


• | The following will be inserted under the heading and thus will become the first two paragraphs in the discussion:

Before September 1, 2018, our operating partnership was a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes because we owned 100% of the interests in it, directly or through other disregarded entities. Since September 1, 2018, our operating partnership has been treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, a domestic unincorporated entity with two or more partners is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless it affirmatively elects to be treated as a corporation. However, certain “publicly traded partnerships” are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We intend to comply with one or more exceptions from treatment as a corporation under the publicly traded partnership rules. Failure to qualify for such an exception would prevent us from qualifying as a REIT. 
When our operating partnership became taxable as a partnership, we generally were treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as contributing our properties to the operating partnership. As a result, for our properties that were appreciated at such time, we may recognize a smaller share of tax depreciation, and a larger share of tax gain on sale, from such properties after the deemed contribution, as compared to our former percentage interest in the operating partnership.
New TRSs
In September 2018, our indirect subsidiaries, DiamondRock Cayman Islands, Inc., a Cayman Island corporation, and CPFB Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, elected to be treated as our TRSs. Generally the provisions under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” in the prospectus that discuss TRSs should apply to DiamondRock Cayman Islands, Inc. and CPFB Holdings, LLC, including, but not limited to, the discussion of TRS lessees as CPFB Holdings, LLC has formed such a subsidiary.
Recent IRS Guidance on Recent Tax Legislation
In September 2018, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) issued guidance clarifying that global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiary corporations that is included in a REIT’s taxable income is qualifying REIT income for purposes of the 95% gross income test. As a result, the fourth, fifth and sixth sentences in the second paragraph under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Recent Tax Legislation” in the prospectus are deleted and replaced with the following:
The IRS issued guidance that GILTI constitutes qualifying REIT income for purposes of the 95% gross income test, and thus the inclusion of GILTI earned by DiamondRock Frenchman's Owner, Inc. and DiamondRock Cayman Islands, Inc. in our U.S. taxable income should not influence our ownership structure of these foreign TRSs but no assurances can be given. The inclusion of such GILTI in our U.S. taxable income, however, could increase our dividend distribution requirement, regardless of whether we receive a corresponding distribution of cash from our foreign TRSs.
Recent FATCA Regulations 
On December 18, 2018, the IRS promulgated proposed Treasury Regulations under Sections 1471-1474 of the Code (commonly referred to as FATCA), which proposed regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on gross proceeds of a disposition of property that can produce U.S. source interest or dividends and thus implicate certain tax-related disclosures contained in the prospectus. While these proposed Treasury Regulations have not yet been finalized, taxpayers are generally entitled to rely on the proposed Treasury Regulations (subject to certain limited exceptions). As a result, the discussion under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - FATCA Withholding and Reporting” in the prospectus is revised as follows: 

• | In the second sentence, the phrase “, and gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of,” is deleted; and


• | The third and fourth sentences are deleted.

Recent Partnership Audit Regulations
-11-

On December 21, 2018, the IRS adopted final Treasury Regulations under Sections 6221-6241 of the Code to implement the centralized partnership audit regime, and applicable finalized Treasury Regulations retain the ability of a REIT that is a partner in a partnership to use deficiency dividend procedures with respect to partnership adjustments resulting from a “push-out election.”
