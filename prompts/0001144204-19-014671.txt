--------+---------

Overview
 
We, together with our affiliated physician groups and consolidated entities, are a physician-centric integrated population health management company providing coordinated, outcomes-based medical care in a cost-effective manner and serving patients in California, the majority of whom are covered by private or public insurance provided through Medicare, Medicaid and health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), with a small portion of our revenue coming from non-insured patients. We provide care coordination services to each major constituent of the healthcare delivery system, including patients, families, primary care physicians, specialists, acute care hospitals, alternative sites of inpatient care, physician groups and health plans. Our physician network consists of primary care physicians, specialist physicians and hospitalists. We operate primarily through Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc. (“ApolloMed”) and the following subsidiaries: Network Medical Management (“NMM”), Apollo Medical Management, Inc. (“AMM”), APAACO and Apollo Care Connect, Inc. (“Apollo Care Connect”), and their consolidated entities, including consolidated VIEs.
 
Led by a management team with several decades of experience, we built a company and culture that is focused on physicians providing high-quality medical care, population health management and care coordination for patients. We are well-positioned to take advantage of the growing trends in the U.S. healthcare industry towards value-based and results-oriented healthcare focusing on the triple aim of patient satisfaction, high-quality care and cost efficiency.
 
Through our NGACO model and a network of independent practice associations (“IPAs”) with more than 6,000 contracted physicians, which physician groups have agreements with various health plans, hospitals and other HMOs, we are currently responsible for coordinating the care for over 800,000 patients in California. These covered patients are comprised of managed care members whose health coverage is provided through their employers or who have acquired health coverage directly from a health plan or as a result of their eligibility for Medicaid or Medicare benefits. Our managed patients benefit from an integrated approach that places physicians at the center of patient care and utilizes sophisticated risk management techniques and clinical protocols to provide high-quality, cost effective care. To implement a patient-centered, physician-centric experience, we also have other integrated and synergistic operations, including (i) management service organizations (“MSOs”) that provide management and other services to our affiliated IPAs, (ii) outpatient clinics and (iii) hospitalists that coordinate the care of patients in hospitals.
 
In December 2017, we completed a reverse merger with NMM, a California corporation formed in 1994 (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, NMM became a wholly owned subsidiary of ApolloMed, following which former NMM shareholders currently own more than 80% of the issued and outstanding shares of ApolloMed’s common stock. The combined company operates under the Apollo Medical Holdings name. NMM is the larger entity in terms of assets, revenues and earnings. In addition, as of the closing of the Merger, the majority of the board of directors of the combined company was comprised of former NMM directors and directors nominated for election by NMM. Accordingly, ApolloMed is considered to be the legal acquirer (and accounting acquiree), whereas NMM is considered to be the accounting acquirer (and legal acquiree).
 
As of December 31, 2018, our affiliated medical groups provided hospitalist services at multiple acute-care hospitals, long-term acute care facilities and outpatient clinics. ApolloMed and its subsidiaries, including consolidated VIEs, generate revenue by providing administrative, medical management and clinical services to affiliated IPAs and medical groups. The administrative services cover primarily billing, collection, accounting, administrative, quality assurance, marketing, compliance and education. In addition, our NGACO, which served over 30,000 beneficiaries through 2018, is eligible to receive periodic advance payments from CMS for managing care for aligned beneficiaries.
 
We implement and operate different innovative health care models, primarily including the following integrated operations:
 

· | IPAs, which contract with physicians and provide care to Medicare, Medicaid, commercial and dual-eligible patients on a risk- and value-based fee basis; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | MSOs, which provide management, administrative and other support services to our affiliated physician groups such as IPAs; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | APAACO, which started operations on January 1, 2017, and previously, several accountable care organizations (“ACOs”), which participated in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (the “MSSP”) sponsored by CMS and focused on providing high-quality and cost-efficient care to Medicare fee-for-service (“FFS”) patients; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Outpatient clinics providing specialty care, including an ambulatory surgery center and a cardiac clinic care and diagnostic testing center; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Hospitalists, which includes our employed and contracted physicians who focus on the delivery of comprehensive medical care to hospitalized patients; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | A cloud-based population health management IT platform, which includes digital care plans, a case management module, connectivity with multiple healthcare tracking devices and integrated clinical data. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We operate under one reportable segment, the healthcare delivery segment. Our revenue streams are diversified among our various operations and contract types, and include:
 

· | Capitation payments, including payments made by CMS from the NGACO model; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Risk pool settlements and incentives;
--+--------------------------------------


· | Management fees, including stipends from hospitals and percentages of collections; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FFS reimbursements.

ApolloMed’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and traded under the symbol “AMEH.”
 
Organization
 
Subsidiaries
 
We operate through our subsidiaries, primarily including:
 

· | NMM;
--+-----


· | AMM;
--+-----


· | APAACO; and
--+------------


· | Apollo Care Connect;
--+---------------------

 
Each of NMM and AMM operates as a MSO and is in the business of providing management services to physician practice corporations under long-term management and/or administrative services agreements (“MSAs”), pursuant to which NMM or AMM, as applicable, manages certain non-medical services for the physician group and has exclusive authority over all non-medical decision making related to ongoing business operations. The MSAs generally provide for management fees that are recognized as earned based on a percentage of revenue or cash collections generated by the physician practices.
 
APAACO, jointly owned by NMM and AMM, participates in the NGACO Model of CMS as of January 2017. The NGACO Model is a CMS program that allows provider groups to assume higher levels of financial risk and potentially achieve a higher reward from participating in this new attribution-based risk sharing model.
 
We operated three legacy ACOs that participated in the MSSP to serve the Medicare FFS population: ApolloMed Accountable Care Organization, Inc. (“Apollo-ACO”), majority owned by ApolloMed, as well as APCN-ACO, Inc. (“APCN-ACO”) and Allied Physicians ACO, LLC (“AP-ACO”), wholly owned by NMM. In 2017, we transitioned patients and physicians from the three legacy ACO’s into APAACO, which was established in May 2016 to operate under the NGACO Model.
 
Apollo Care Connect provides a cloud and mobile-based population health management platform, with an emphasis on chronic care management and high-risk patient management in addition to a comprehensive platform for total patient engagement. Features include a personal health assistant that allows patients to view their health data and interact with their physician and care managers, and evidence-based digital care plans that leverage our expertise in clinical care, care coordination and medical risk management to deliver value-based care.

Variable Interest Entities
 
If an entity is determined to be a VIE, we evaluate whether we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary analysis is a qualitative analysis based on power and benefits. We consolidate a VIE if we have both power and benefits – that is, (i) we have the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly influence the VIE’s economic performance (power), and (ii) we have the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE (benefits). See Note 19 – “Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)” to our consolidated financial statements for information on our entity that qualified as a consolidated VIE. If we have a variable interest in a VIE but are not the primary beneficiary, we may account for our investment using the equity method of accounting (see Note 7 – “Investments in Other Entities”).
 
Some states have laws that prohibit business entities with non-physician owners from practicing medicine, which are generally referred to as the corporate practice of medicine. States that have corporate practice of medicine laws require only physicians to practice medicine, exercise control over medical decisions or engage in certain arrangements with other physicians, such as fee-splitting. California is a corporate practice of medicine state.
 
Therefore, in addition to our subsidiaries, we mainly operate by maintaining long-term management services agreements with our affiliated IPAs, which are owned and operated by a network of independent primary care physicians and specialists, and which employ or contract with additional physicians to provide medical services. Under such agreements, we provide and perform non-medical management and administrative services, including financial management, information systems, marketing, risk management and administrative support.
 
NMM has entered into MSAs with several affiliated IPAs, including Allied Physicians of California IPA d.b.a. Allied Pacific of California IPA (“APC”). APC contracts with various HMOs or licensed health care service plans, each of which pays a fixed capitation payment to APC. In return, APC arranges for the delivery of health care services by contracting with physicians or professional medical corporations for primary care and specialty care services. APC assumes the financial risk of the cost of delivering health care services in excess of the fixed amounts received. The risk is subject to stop-loss provisions in contracts with HMOs. Some risk is transferred to the contracted physicians or professional corporations. The physicians in the IPA are exclusively in control of, and responsible for, all aspects of the practice of medicine for enrolled patients. In accordance with relevant accounting guidance, APC is determined to be a VIE of NMM, as NMM is the primary beneficiary of APC with the ability, through majority representation on the APC Joint Planning Board, to direct the activities (excluding clinical decisions) that most significantly affect APC’s economic performance.
 
Through AMM, we manage a number of our affiliates pursuant to their long-term MSAs, including: ApolloMed Hospitalists (“AMH”), a physician group that provides hospitalist, intensivist and physician advisor services and Southern California Heart Centers (“SCHC”), a specialty clinic that focuses on cardiac care and diagnostic testing. Each of AMH and SCHC are VIEs of AMM as it was determined that AMM is the primary beneficiary of such entities. Concourse Diagnostic Surgery Center, LLC (“CDSC”) is an ambulatory surgery center in City of Industry, California. The facility is Medicare Certified and accredited by the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Healthcare. CDSC is consolidated as a VIE by APC as it was determined that APC has a controlling financial interest in CDSC and is the primary beneficiary of CDSC. AHMC International Cancer Center (“ICC”) provides comprehensive, compassionate post-cancer-diagnosis care and a wide range of support services. ICC was determined to be a VIE of APC and is consolidated by APC as it was determined that APC is the primary beneficiary of ICC through its power and obligation to absorb losses and rights to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to ICC.
 
APC, AMH, SCHC, CDSC and ICC, therefore, are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements.
 
Investments
 
We invested in several entities in the healthcare industry through APC, our VIE. Universal Care Acquisition Partners, LLC (“UCAP”), a wholly owned subsidiary of APC, holds a 48.9% ownership interest and 50% voting interest in Universal Care, Inc. (“UCI”), a private full-service health plan that contracts with CMS under Medicare Advantage. Pacific Ambulatory Surgery Center, LLC (“PASC”), in which APC has a 40% non-controlling ownership interest, is a multi-specialty outpatient surgery center that is certified to participate in the Medicare program and accredited by the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care. As of December 31, 2018, APC also holds a 4.82 % ownership interest in ApolloMed.
 
Due to laws prohibiting a California professional corporation which has more than one shareholder (such as APC) from being a shareholder in another California professional corporation, APC cannot directly own shares in other professional corporations in which APC has invested. An exception to this prohibition, however, permits a professional corporation that has only one shareholder to own shares in another professional corporation. In reliance on this exception, APC-LSMA, a designated shareholder professional corporation solely owned by Dr. Thomas Lam and controlled by APC, holds non-controlling ownership interests in several medical corporations, including the IPA line of business of LaSalle Medical Associates (“LMA”), Pacific Medical Imaging and Oncology Center, Inc. (“PMIOC”), Diagnostic Medical Group (“DMG”) and Accountable Health Care IPA (“Accountable”). The IPA line of business of LMA operates four neighborhood medical centers and serves patients across Fresno, Kings, Los Angeles, Madera, Riverside, San Bernardino and Tulare Counties, California, with which NMM has a management services agreement. PMIOC offers comprehensive diagnostic imaging services at its facilities. DMG, operates complete outpatient imaging centers to improve the detection and treatment of heart disease. Accountable is a California professional medical corporation that has served the local community in the greater Los Angeles County area through a network of physicians and health care providers for more than 20 years. Accountable currently has a network of over 400 primary and 700 specialty care physicians, and eight community and regional hospital medical centers that provide quality health care services to more than 160,000 members of seven federally qualified health plans and multiple product lines, including Medi-Cal, Commercial and Medicare.
 
Our Industry
 
Industry Overview
 
U.S. healthcare spending has increased steadily over the past 20 years. According to CMS, the estimated total U.S. healthcare expenditures are expected to grow by 5.5% from 2017 to 2026 and to reach $6.0 trillion by 2027. Health spending is projected to grow 1.0% faster than the U.S. gross domestic product over the 2017-2026 projection period, and as a result, the healthcare share of gross domestic product is expected to rise from 17.9% in 2016 to 19.7% by 2026. Medicare spending increased 4.2% to $705.9 billion and Medicaid spending increased by 2.9% to $581.9 billion in 2017, which accounted for 19.9% and 17.1% of total health expenditures, respectively. Private health insurance spending increased 4.2% to $1.2 trillion in 2017, accounting for 34% of total health expenditures. Growth in Medicare (7.4%) and Medicaid (5.8%) are both substantial contributors to the rate of national health expenditure growth for the projection period. Both trends reflect the impact of an aging population, but in different ways. For Medicare, projected enrollment growth is a primary driver; for Medicaid, it is an increasing projected share of aged and disabled enrollees.

Managed care health plans were developed in the U.S. primarily during the 1980s, in an attempt to mitigate the rising cost of providing health care to populations covered by health insurance. These managed care health plans enroll members through their employers in connection with federal Medicare benefits or state Medicaid programs. As a result of the prevalence of these health plans, many seniors now becoming eligible for Medicare have been interacting with managed care companies through their employers for the last 30 years. Individuals now turning 65 are likely more familiar with the managed care setting than previous Medicare populations. The healthcare industry, however, is highly regulated by various government agencies and heavily relies on reimbursement and payments from government sponsored programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Companies in the healthcare industry therefore have to organize and operate around, and face challenges from, idiosyncratic laws and regulations.
 
Many health plans recognize both the opportunity for growth from adding members as well as the potential risks and costs associated with managing additional members. In California, many health plans subcontract a significant portion of the responsibility for managing patient care to integrated medical systems such as us and our affiliated physician groups. These integrated health care systems offer a comprehensive medical delivery system and sophisticated care management know-how and infrastructure to more efficiently provide for the health care needs of the population enrolled with that health plan. While reimbursement models for these arrangements vary around the U.S., health plans often prospectively pay the integrated health care system a fixed capitation payment, which is often based on a percentage of the amount received by the health plan. Capitation payments to integrated health care systems, in the aggregate, represent a prospective budget from which the system manages care-related expenses on behalf of the population enrolled with that system. To the extent that these systems manage such expenses under the capitated levels, the system realizes an operating profit. On the other hand, if the expenses exceed projected levels, the system will realize an operating deficit. Since premiums paid represent a substantial amount per person, there is a significant revenue opportunity for an integrated medical system that is able to effectively manage health care costs for the capitated arrangements entered into by its affiliated physician groups.
 
Industry Trends and Demand Drivers
 
We believe that the healthcare industry is undergoing a significant transformation and the demand for our offerings is driven by the confluence of a number of fundamental healthcare industry trends, including:
 
Shift to Value-Based and Results-Oriented Models. According to the 2017 National Health Expenditure Projections prepared by CMS, healthcare spending in the U.S. is projected to have increased 3.9% on a year-over-year basis to $3.5 trillion in 2017, representing 17.9% of U.S. Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”). CMS projects healthcare spending in the U.S. to increase at an average rate of 5.5% per year for 2017-26 and to reach approximately $6.0 trillion by 2027. To address this expected significant rise in healthcare costs, the U.S. healthcare market is seeking more efficient and effective methods of delivering care. It is argued that the fee-for-service reimbursement model has played a major role in increasing the level and growth rate of healthcare spending. In response, both the public and private sectors are shifting away from the fee-for-service reimbursement model toward value-based, capitated payment models that are designed to incentivize value and quality at an individual patient level. The number of Americans covered by capitated payment programs continues to increase, which drives more coordinated and outcomes-based patient care.
 
Increasingly Patient-Centered. More patients want to take a more active and informed role in how their own healthcare is delivered. This transformation results in the healthcare marketplace becoming increasingly patient-centered and requires providers to deliver team-based, coordinated and accessible care to stay competitive.
 
Added Complexity. In the healthcare space, more sophisticated technology has been employed, new diagnostics and treatments have been introduced, research and development has expanded, and regulations have multiplied. This expanding complexity drives a growing and continuous need for integrated care delivery systems.
Integration of Healthcare Information. Across the healthcare landscape, a significant amount of data is being created every day, driven by patient care, payment systems, regulatory compliance, and record keeping. As the amount of healthcare data continues to grow, it becomes increasingly important to connect disparate data and apply insights in a targeted manner in order to better achieve the goals of higher quality and more efficient care.
Integrated Medical Systems
 
Integrated medical systems that are able to pool a large number of patients, such as us and our affiliated physician groups, are positioned to take advantage of industry trends, meet patient and government demands, and benefit from cost advantages resulting from their scale of operation and integrated approach of care delivery. In addition, integrated medical systems with years of managed care experience can leverage their expertise and sizeable medical data to identify specific treatment strategies and interventions, improve the quality of medical care and lower cost. Many integrated medical systems have also established physician performance metrics that allow them to monitor quality and service outcomes achieved by participating physicians in order to reward efficient, high quality care delivered to members and initiate improvement efforts for physicians whose performance can be enhanced.

IPAs and MSOs
 
An IPA is an association of independent physicians, or other organization that contracts with independent physicians, and provides services to HMOs, which are medical insurance groups that provide health services generally for a fixed annual fee, on a negotiated per capita rate, flat retainer fee, or negotiated FFS basis. Because of the prohibition against corporate practice of medicine under certain state laws, MSOs are formed to provide management and administrative support services to affiliated physician groups such as IPAs. These services include payroll, benefits, human resource services, physician practice billing, revenue cycle services, physician practice management, administrative oversight, coding and other consulting services.
 
NGACOs and MSSP ACOs
 
CMS established the NGACO Model to test whether health outcomes will improve and Medicare Parts A and B expenditures for Medicare beneficiaries will decrease if ACOs (1) accept a higher level of financial risk compared to the existing MSSP model, and (2) are permitted to select certain innovative Medicare payment arrangements and to offer certain additional benefit enhancements to their assigned Medicare beneficiaries. As a result, ACOs generally assume higher levels of financial risk and reward under the NGACO Model. CMS also established the MSSP to improve the care quality and reduce costs for beneficiaries in the Medicare FFS program. MSSP promotes accountability, facilitates coordination and cooperation among care providers, and encourages investment in infrastructure and redesign of care processes.
 
Outpatient Clinics
 
Ambulatory surgery centers and other outpatient clinics are healthcare facilities that specialize in performing outpatient surgeries, ambulatory treatments and diagnostic and other services in local communities. As medical care has increasingly been delivered in clinic settings, many integrated medical systems also operate healthcare facilities primarily focused on the diagnosis and/or care of outpatients, including those with chronic conditions such as heart disease and diabetes, to cover the primary healthcare needs of local communities.
Hospitalists
 
Hospitalists are doctors specialized in the care of patients in the hospital. Hospitalists assume the inpatient care responsibilities otherwise provided by primary care or other attending physicians and are reimbursed through the same billing procedures as other physicians. Hospitalists tend to focus exclusively on inpatient care. By practicing in the same facilities, hospitalists perform consistent functions, interact regularly with the same healthcare professionals and thus are familiar with specific and unique hospital processes, which can result in greater efficiency, less process variability and better outcomes. Through managing the treatment of a large number of patients with similar clinical needs, hospitalists generally develop practice expertise in both the diagnosis and treatment of common conditions that require hospitalization. For these reasons, hospitalists have an increasingly important role in improving care quality. According to the Society of Hospital Medicine, in the U.S., the number of hospitalists grew in the past decade from a few hundred to more than 50,000 by 2016, making it one of the fastest-growing medical specialties, and the percentage of hospitals using hospitalists increased to more than 70% by 2014.
Population Health Management
 
Population health management (“PHM”) is a central trend within healthcare delivery, which includes the aggregation of patient data across multiple health information technology resources, the analysis of that data into a single, actionable patient record, and the actions through which care providers can improve both clinical and financial outcomes. PHM seeks to improve the health outcomes, by monitoring and identifying individual patients, aggregating data, and providing a comprehensive clinical picture of each patient. Using that data, providers can track, and hopefully improve, clinical outcomes while lowering costs. A successful PHM requires a robust care and risk management infrastructure, a cohesive delivery system, and a well-managed partnership network.
Our Business Operations
 
IPAs
 
Each of our affiliated IPAs is comprised of a network of independent primary care physicians and specialists who collectively care for patients and contracts with HMOs to provide physician services to their enrollees typically under capitated arrangements. Under the capitated model, a HMO pays the IPA a capitation payment and assigns it the responsibility for providing physician services required by patients. The IPA physicians are exclusively in control of, and responsible for, all aspects of the practice of medicine for enrolled patients. Most of the HMO agreements have an initial term of two years renewing automatically for successive one-year terms. The HMO agreements generally allow either party to terminate the HMO agreements without cause typically with a four to six month advance notice and provide for a termination for cause by the HMO at any time.

MSOs
 
Our MSOs generally provide services to our affiliated IPAs or ACOs under long-term MSAs, pursuant to which they manage certain non-medical services for the physician groups and have exclusive authority over all non-medical decision making related to ongoing business operations. These services include but are not limited to:
 

· | Physician recruiting; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Physician and health plan contracting; 
· | Medical management, including utilization management and quality assurance; 
· | Provider relations; 
· | Member services, including annual wellness evaluations; and 
· | Pre-negotiating contracts with specialists, labs, imaging centers, nursing homes and other vendors. 

NGACO
 
On January 18, 2017, CMS announced that APAACO had been approved to participate in the NGACO Model and began operations under this new model. We have devoted, and expect to continue to devote, significant effort and resources, financial and otherwise, to the NGACO Model. In connection with APAACO’s participation in the NGACO Model, CMS and APAACO have entered our third year into our Participation Agreement. The initial term of the Participation Agreement expired on December 31, 2018, subsequently CMS and APAACO renewed the Participation Agreement for an additional year, with the option for a second renewal year in 2020. Additionally, the Participation Agreement may be terminated sooner by CMS as specified therein, and CMS has the authority to alter or change the program over this time period.
 
In advance of its participation in the NGACO Model, APAACO entered into agreements with over 750 medical care providers, including physicians, hospitals, nursing facilities and multiple labs, radiology centers, outpatient surgery centers, dialysis clinics and other service providers. APAACO negotiated discounted rates and such providers agreed to receive 100% of their claims for beneficiaries reimbursed by APAACO.
 
Among many requirements to be eligible to participate in the NGACO Model, ACOs must have at least 10,000 assigned Medicare beneficiaries and must maintain that number throughout each performance year. APAACO started its 2017 performance year with more than 29,000 aligned Medicare FFS beneficiaries, which continued to increase with 30,000 aligned beneficiaries in 2018. This number may decrease if beneficiaries join a managed care plan, pass away or move out of the service area.
 
Under the Participation Agreement, APAACO shall require its participants and preferred providers to make medically necessary covered services available to beneficiaries in accordance with applicable laws, regulations and guidance, and APAACO and its participants may not participate in any other Medicare shared savings initiatives.
 
There are different levels of financial risk and reward that an ACO may select under the NGACO Model, and the extent of risk and reward may be limited on a percentage basis. The NGACO Model offers two risk arrangement options. In Arrangement A, the ACO takes 80% of Medicare Part A and Part B risk. In Arrangement B, the ACO takes 100% of Medicare Part A and Part B risk. Under each risk arrangement, the ACO can cap aggregate savings and losses anywhere between 5% to 15%. The cap is elected annually by the ACO. APAACO has opted for Risk Arrangement A and a shared savings and losses cap of 5%.
 
The NGACO Model offers four payment mechanisms:
 

· | Payment Mechanism #1: Normal FFS. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Payment Mechanism #2: Normal FFS plus Infrastructure payments of $6 Per Beneficiary Per Month (“PBPM”). 
· | Payment Mechanism #3: Population-Based Payments (“PBP”). PBP payments provide ACOs with a monthly payment to support ongoing ACO activities. ACO participants and preferred providers must agree to percentage payment fee reductions, which are then used to estimate a monthly PBP payment to be received by the ACO. 
· | Payment Mechanism #4: AIPBP. Under this mechanism, CMS will estimate the total annual expenditures of the ACO’s aligned beneficiaries and pay that projected amount in PBPM payments. ACOs in AIPBP may have alternative compensation arrangements with their providers, including 100% FFS, discounted FFS, capitation or case rates. 

 
APAACO opted for, and was approved by CMS effective on April 1, 2017 to participate in, the AIPBP track, which is the most advanced risk-taking payment model. When approved, APAACO was the only ACO participating in the AIPBP track, out of 44 ACOs approved for the NGACO Model in the U.S. Under the AIPBP track, CMS estimates the total annual expenditures for APAACO’s beneficiaries then pays that projected amount to APAACO in a per-beneficiary, per-month payment, and APAACO is responsible for paying all Part A and Part B costs for in-network participating providers and preferred providers with whom it has contracted. Between April and December 2017, this resulted in APAACO receiving approximately $9.3 million per month from CMS.
 
In October 2017, CMS notified the Company that it would not be renewed for participation in the AIPBP payment mechanism of the NGACO Model for performance year 2018 due to certain alleged deficiencies in performance. The Company submitted a reconsideration request and received an official decision from CMS in December 2017 that reversed the prior decision against the Company’s continued participation in the AIPBP mechanism. As a result, the Company was eligible for receiving monthly AIPBP payments at a rate of approximately $7.3 million per month from CMS that started in February 2018. Effective October 1, 2018, CMS reduced our AIPBP payments to approximately $5.5 million per month based on the estimated total annual expenditures APAACO expected to incur. Effective January 1, 2019, this monthly rate was increased from approximately $5.5 million to approximately $8.3 million per month.
 
On November 6, 2018, the Company was notified by CMS that under the NGACO alternative payment arrangement, the Company was paid an excess amount of approximately $34.5 million related to the first performance year (January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017) with a six month run out through June 30, 2018. This excess amount has been refunded to CMS on December 4, 2018. This amount was previously accrued as part of the medical liabilities accrual on December 31, 2017.

Our Revenue Streams
 
Our revenue reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements includes revenue generated by our subsidiaries and consolidated entities. Revenue generated by consolidated entities, however, does not necessarily result in available or distributable cash for ApolloMed. Our revenue streams flow from various multi-year renewable contractual arrangements that vary by types of our business operations in the following manners:
Capitation Revenue
 
Our capitation revenue consist primarily of capitated fees for medical services provided by us under a capitated arrangement directly made with various managed care providers including HMOs. Capitation revenues are typically prepaid monthly to us based on the number of enrollees selecting us as their healthcare provider. Capitation is a fixed amount of money per patient per unit of time paid in advance for the delivery of health care services, whereby the service providers are generally liable for excess medical costs. The actual amount paid is determined by the ranges of services provided, the number of patients enrolled, and the period of time during which the services are provided. Capitation rates are generally based on local costs and average utilization of services. Because Medicare pays capitation using a “risk adjustment model,” which compensates managed care providers based on the health status (acuity) of each individual enrollee, managed care providers with higher acuity enrollees receive more, and those with lower acuity enrollees receive less, capitation that can be allocated to service providers. Under the risk adjustment model, capitation is paid on an interim basis based on enrollee data submitted for the preceding year and is adjusted in subsequent periods after the final data is compiled.
 
Per member per month (“PMPM”) managed care contracts generally have a term of one year or longer. All managed care contracts have a single performance obligation that constitutes a series for the provision of managed healthcare services for a population of enrolled members for the duration of the contract. The transaction price for PMPM contracts is variable as it primarily includes PMPM fees associated with unspecified membership that fluctuates throughout the contract. In certain contracts, PMPM fees also include adjustments for items such as performance incentives, performance guarantees and risk shares. The majority of our net PMPM transaction price relates specifically to our efforts to transfer the service for a distinct increment of the series (e.g. day or month) and is recognized as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service.

Risk Pool Settlements and Incentives
 
Capitation arrangements are supplemented by risk sharing arrangements. We have two different types of capitation risk sharing arrangements: full risk and shared risk arrangements.
 
We enter into full risk capitation arrangements with certain health plans and local hospitals, which are administered by a related party, where the hospital is responsible for providing, arranging and paying for institutional risk. We are responsible for providing, arranging and paying for professional risk. Under a full risk pool sharing agreement, we generally receive a percentage of the net surplus from the affiliated hospital’s risk pools with HMOs after deductions for the affiliated hospital’s costs. Advance settlement payments are typically made quarterly in arrears if there is a surplus. Risk pool settlements under arrangements with health plans and hospitals are recognized using the most likely methodology and amounts are only included in revenue to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur once any uncertainty is resolved. The assumptions for medical loss ratios (“MLR”), incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) completion factor and constraint percentages were used by management in applying the most likely method.
 
Under capitated arrangements with certain HMOs we participate in one or more shared risk arrangements relating to the provision of institutional services to enrollees (shared risk arrangements) and thus can earn additional revenue or incur losses based upon the enrollee utilization of institutional services. Shared risk capitation arrangements are entered into with certain health plans, which are administered by the health plan, where we are responsible for rendering professional services, but the health plan does not enter into a capitation arrangement with a hospital and therefore the health plan retains the institutional risk. Shared risk deficits, if any, are not payable until and unless (and only to the extent of any) risk sharing surpluses are generated. At the termination of the HMO contract, any accumulated deficit will be extinguished.
 
In addition to risk-sharing revenues, we also receive incentives under “pay-for-performance” programs for quality medical care, based on various criteria. As an incentive to control enrollee utilization and to promote quality care, certain HMOs have designed the quality incentive programs and commercial generic pharmacy incentive programs to compensate us for efforts it takes to improve the quality of services and for efficient and effective use of pharmacy supplemental benefits provided to the HMO’s members. The incentive programs track specific performance measures and calculate payments to us based on the performance measures.
 
Generally, for the foregoing arrangements, the final settlement is dependent on each distinct day’s performance within the annual measurement period, but cannot be allocated to specific days until the full measurement period has occurred and performance can be assessed.
 
Management Fee Income
 
Management fee income encompasses fees paid for management, physician advisory, healthcare staffing, administrative and other non-medical services provided by us to IPAs, hospitals and other healthcare providers. Such fees may be in the form of billings at agreed-upon hourly rates, percentages of revenue or fee collections, or amounts fixed on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. The revenue may include variable arrangements measuring factors such as hours staffed, patient visits or collections per visit against benchmarks, and, in certain cases, may be subject to achieving quality metrics or fee collections.
 
NGACO Revenue
 
Through APAACO, we participate in the AIPBP track of the NGACO Model sponsored by CMS. Under the NGACO Model, CMS grants us a pool of patients to manage (direct care and pay providers) based on a budgetary benchmark established with CMS but we are ultimately responsible for managing the medical costs for these beneficiaries. The beneficiaries will receive services from physicians and other medical service providers that are both in-network and out-of-network. Under the AIPBP track, CMS estimates an average of monthly expenditures for the previous calendar year for APAACO’s aligned beneficiaries and pays that projected amount to us in monthly installments, and we are responsible for all Part A and Part B costs for in-network participating providers and preferred providers contracted by us to provide services to the aligned beneficiaries. Claims from out-of-network providers are processed and paid by CMS, our shared savings or losses in managing the services provided by out-of-network providers are generally determined on an annual basis after reconciliation with CMS. Pursuant to our risk share agreement with CMS, we will be eligible to receive the surplus or be liable for the deficit according to the budgetary benchmark established by CMS based on our efficiency or lack thereof, in managing how the beneficiaries aligned to us by CMS are served by in-network and out-of-network providers. Our shared savings or losses on providing such services are both capped by CMS. We recognize such savings or deficit upon substantial completion of reconciliation and determination of the amounts.
 
Under the AIPBP agreement we received $5.9 million in risk pool savings, related to the 2017 performance year, and have recognized it as revenue in the risk pool settlements and incentives in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
In October 2017, CMS notified the Company that it would not be renewed for participation in the AIPBP payment mechanism of the NGACO Model for performance year 2018 due to certain alleged deficiencies in performance. The Company submitted a reconsideration request. In December 2017, the Company received the official decision on its reconsideration request that CMS reversed the prior decision against the Company’s continued participation in the AIPBP mechanism. As a result, the Company was eligible for receiving monthly AIPBP payments at a rate of approximately $7.3 million per month from CMS that started in February 2018, which was reduced to $5.5 million per month beginning October 1, 2018. The Company, however, will need to continue to comply with all terms and conditions in the Participation Agreement and various regulatory requirements to be eligible to participate in the AIPBP mechanism and/or NGACO Model. Effective January 1, 2019, the monthly AIPBP payments increased from approximately $5.5 million to approximately $8.3 million per month.

Fee For Service Revenue
 
FFS revenue represents revenue earned under contracts in which we bill and collect the professional component of charges for medical services rendered by our contracted physicians and employed physicians. Under the FFS arrangements, we bill the hospitals and third-party payors for the physician staffing and further bill patients or their third-party payors for patient care services provided and receive payments.Our Key Payors
 
We have a few key payors that represent a significant portion of our net revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, four payors accounted for an aggregate of 61.5% and 54.6% of our total net revenue, respectively.
Our Strengths and Advantages
 
The following are some of the material opportunities that we believe exist for our company.
 
Combination of Clinical, Administrative and Technology Capabilities
 
We believe our key strength lies in our combined clinical, administrative and technology capabilities. While many companies separately provide clinical, MSO or technology support services, to our knowledge there are currently very few organizations like us that provide all three types of services to over 800,000 patients.
Diversification
 
Through our subsidiaries, consolidated affiliates and invested entities, we have been able to reduce our business risk and increase revenue opportunities by diversifying our service offerings and expanding our ability to manage patient care across a horizontally integrated care network. Our revenue is spread across our operations. Additionally, with our ability to monitor and manage care within our wide network, we are an attractive business partner to health plans, hospitals, IPAs and other medical groups seeking to provide better care at lower costs.
Strong Management Team
 
Our management team has, collectively, several decades of experience managing physician practices, risk-based organizations, health plans, hospitals and health systems, a deep understanding of the healthcare marketplace and emerging trends, and a vision for the future of healthcare delivery led by physician-driven healthcare networks.
A Robust Physician Network
 
As of December 31, 2018, our physician network consisted of over 6,000 contracted physicians, including primary care physicians, specialist physicians and hospitalists, through our affiliated physician groups and ACOs.

Cultural Affinities with Patients
 
In addition to delivering premium health care, we believe in the importance of providing services that are sensitive to the needs of local communities, including their cultural affinities, which are shared by physicians within our affiliated IPAs and medical groups, and thus promoting patients’ comfort in communicating with care providers.
 
Long-Standing Relationships with Partners
 
We have developed long-standing relationships with and have earned trust from multiple health plans, hospitals, IPAs and other medical groups that have helped to generate recurring contractual revenue for us.
 
Comprehensive and Effective Healthcare Management Programs
 
We offer comprehensive and effective healthcare management programs to patients. We have developed expertise in population health management and care coordination, in proper medical coding, which results in improved Risk Adjustment Factor (“RAF”) scores and higher payments from health plans, and in improving quality metrics in both inpatient and outpatient settings and thus patient satisfaction and CMS scores. Using our own proprietary risk assessment scoring tool, we have also developed our own protocol for identifying high-risk patients.
Competition
 
The healthcare industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete for customers across all of our services with other health care management companies including MSOs and healthcare providers such as local, regional and national networks of physicians, medical groups and hospitals, many of which are substantially larger than us and have significantly greater financial and other resources, including personnel, than what we have.
 
IPAs
 
Our affiliated IPAs compete with other IPAs, medical groups and hospitals, many of which have greater financial, personnel and other resources available to them. In the greater Los Angeles area, examples of such competitors  include Regal Medical Group and Lakeside Medical group, which are part of Heritage Provider Network (“Heritage”), as well as HealthCare Partners, which is owned by DaVita Medical Group which was recently bought by UnitedHealth Group.
 
ACOs
 
Our NGACO competes with sophisticated provider groups in the creation, administration, and management of ACOs, including MSSP ACOs and NGACOs, many of which have greater financial, personnel and other resources available to them. For example, in the greater Los Angeles area, major competitors of APAACO include Heritage California ACO and DaVita Medical ACO California.
 
Outpatient Clinics
 
Our outpatient clinics compete with large ambulatory surgery centers and/or diagnostic centers such as Foothill Cardiology (California Heart Medical Group), RadNet and Envision Healthcare, many of which have greater financial, personnel and other resources available to them, as well as smaller clinics that have ties to local communities. HealthCare Partners also has its own urgent care centers, clinics and diagnostic centers.
Hospitalists
 
Because individual physicians may provide hospitalist services if they have necessary credentials and privileges and thus the markets for hospitalist services are highly fragmented, our affiliated hospitalist groups face competition primarily from numerous small inpatient practices in existing and expanding markets but also compete with large physician groups, many of which have greater financial, personnel and other resources available to them. Some of such competitors operate on a national level, including EmCare, Team Health and Sound Physicians.

Regulatory Matters
 
As a healthcare company, our operations and relationships with healthcare providers such as hospitals, other healthcare facilities, and healthcare professionals are subject to extensive and increasing regulation by numerous federal, state, and local government agencies including the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), the Department of Justice, CMS and various state authorities. These laws and regulations often are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively. Imposition of liabilities associated with a violation of any of these healthcare laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot guarantee that our practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to violate certain healthcare laws. Government investigations and prosecutions, even if we are ultimately found to be without fault, can be costly and disruptive to our business. Moreover, changes in healthcare legislation or government regulation may restrict our existing operations, limit our expansion or impose additional compliance requirements and costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Below are brief descriptions of some, but not all, of such laws and regulations that affect our business operations.
Corporate Practice of Medicine
 
Our consolidated financial statements include our subsidiaries and VIEs. Some states have laws that prohibit business entities with non-physician owners, such as ApolloMed and its subsidiaries, from practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine, exercising control over medical decisions by physicians; which are generally referred to as corporate practice of medicine. States that have corporate practice of medicine laws require only physicians to practice medicine, exercise control over medical decisions or engage in certain arrangements such as fee-splitting, with physicians. In these states, a violation of the corporate practice of medicine prohibition constitutes the unlawful practice of medicine, which is a public offense punishable by fines and other criminal penalties. In addition, any physician who participates in a scheme that violates the state’s corporate practice of medicine prohibition may be punished for aiding and abetting a lay entity in the unlawful practice of medicine.
 
California is a corporate practice of medicine state. Therefore, we operate by maintaining long-term MSAs with our affiliated IPAs and medical groups, each of which is owned and operated by physicians only and employs or contracts with additional physicians to provide medical services. Under such MSAs, our wholly owned MSOs are contracted to provide non-medical management and administrative services such as financial and risk management as well as information systems, marketing and administrative support to the IPAs and medical groups. The MSAs typically have an initial term of 3-30 years and are generally not terminable by our affiliated IPAs and medical groups except in the case of bankruptcy, gross negligence, fraud, or other illegal acts by the contracting MSO.
 
Through the MSAs and the relationship with the physician owners of our medical affiliates, we have exclusive authority over all non-medical decisions related to the ongoing business operations of those affiliates. Consequently, ApolloMed consolidates the revenue and expenses of such affiliates as their primary beneficiary from the date of execution of the applicable MSA. When necessary, Dr. Thomas Lam or Dr. Warren Hosseinion, one of our Co-Chief Executive Officers, including through entities in which he is the sole shareholder, serves as a nominee shareholder, on ApolloMed’s behalf, of affiliated medical practices, in order to comply with corporate practice of medicine laws and certain accounting rules applicable to consolidated financial reporting by our affiliates as VIEs.
 
While under these arrangements our MSOs perform only non-medical functions, do not represent to offer medical services, and do not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by physicians. The California Medical Board, as well as other state’s regulatory bodies, has taken the position that MSAs that confer too much control over a physician practice to MSOs may violate the prohibition against corporate practice of medicine. Some of the relevant laws, regulations, and agency interpretations in California and other states that have corporate practice prohibitions have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. Moreover, state laws are subject to change and regulatory authorities. Other parties, including our affiliated physicians, may assert that, despite these arrangements, ApolloMed and its subsidiaries are engaged in the prohibited corporate practice of medicine or that such arrangements constitute unlawful fee-splitting between physicians and non-physicians. If this occurred, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, our MSAs could be found legally invalid and unenforceable in whole or in part, and we could be required to restructure arrangements with our affiliated IPAs and medical groups. If we were required to change our operating structures due to determination that a corporate practice of medicine violation existed, such a restructuring might require revising our MSOs’ management fees.
 
False Claims Acts
 
The False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729 - 3733, imposes civil liability on individuals or entities that submit false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. The False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly or recklessly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim for payment approved. Private parties may initiate qui tam whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the False Claims Act in the name of the federal government and may share in the proceeds of a successful suit. The federal government has used the False Claims Act to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare and state healthcare programs. By way of illustration, these prosecutions may be based upon alleged coding errors, billing for services not rendered, billing services at a higher payment rate than appropriate, and billing for care that is not considered medically necessary. The federal government and a number of courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of certain other statutes, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or the Stark Law, can also be considered a violation of the False Claims Act based on the theory that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement.

Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the government. A False Claims Act violation may provide the basis for the imposition of administrative penalties as well as exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition to the provisions of the False Claims Act, which provide for civil enforcement, the federal government also can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims to the government for payments.
 
A number of states including California have enacted laws that are similar to the federal False Claims Act. Under Section 6031 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (“DRA”), as amended, if a state enacts a false claims act that is at least as stringent as the federal statute and that also meets certain other requirements, the state will be eligible to receive a greater share of any monetary recovery obtained pursuant to certain actions brought under the state’s false claims act. As a result, more states are expected to enact laws that are similar to the federal False Claims Act in the future along with a corresponding increase in state false claims enforcement efforts. In addition, section 6032 of the DRA requires entities that make or receive annual Medicaid payments of $5.0 million or more from any one state to provide their employees, contractors and agents with written policies and employee handbook materials on federal and state False Claims Acts and related statues. At this time, we are not required to comply with section 6032 because we receive less than $5.0 million in Medicaid payments annually from any one state. However, we may likely be required to comply in the future as our Medicaid billings increase.
 
Anti-Kickback Statutes
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a provision of the Social Security Act of 1972 that prohibits as a felony offense the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (1) the referral of a patient for items or services for which payment may be made in whole or part under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs, (2) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs or (3) the purchase, lease, or order or arranging or recommending the purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) amended section 1128B of the Social Security Act to make it clear that a person need not have actual knowledge of the statute, or specific intent to violate the statute, as a predicate for a violation. The OIG, which has the authority to impose administrative sanctions for violation of the statute, has adopted as its standard for review a judicial interpretation which concludes that the statute prohibits any arrangement where even one purpose of the remuneration is to induce or reward referrals. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a felony punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines of up to $25,000, civil fines of up to $50,000 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. A violation also can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. In addition, pursuant to the changes of the ACA, a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a false claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
 
Due to the breadth of the Anti-Kickback Statute’s broad prohibitions, statutory exceptions exist that protect certain arrangements from prosecution. In addition, the OIG has published safe harbor regulations that specify arrangements that are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute, provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of an activity to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute, but these arrangements may be subject to scrutiny and prosecution by enforcement agencies. We may be less willing than some competitors to take actions or enter into arrangements that do not clearly satisfy the OIG safe harbors and suffer a competitive disadvantage.
 
Some states have enacted statutes and regulations similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, but which may be applicable regardless of the payor source for the patient. These state laws may contain exceptions and safe harbors that are different from and/or more limited than those of the federal law and that may vary from state to state. For example, California has adopted the Physician Ownership and Referral Act of 1993 (“PORA”). PORA makes it unlawful for physicians, surgeons and other licensed professionals to refer a person for certain health care services if they have a financial interest with the person or entity that receives the referral. While PORA also provides certain exemptions from this prohibition, failure to fit within an exemption in violation of PORA can lead to a misdemeanor offense that may subject a physician to civil penalties and disciplinary action by the Medical Board of California.
 
We cannot assure that the applicable regulatory authorities will not determine that some of our arrangements with physicians violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to different liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other health care programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Stark Laws
 
The federal Stark Law, 42 U.S.C. 1395nn, also known as the physician self-referral law, generally prohibits a physician from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity (including hospitals) providing ‘‘designated health services,’’ if the physician or a member of the physician’s immediate family has a ‘‘financial relationship’’ with the entity, unless a specific exception applies. Designated health services include, among other services, inpatient hospital services, outpatient prescription drug services, clinical laboratory services, certain imaging services (e.g., MRI, CT, ultrasound), and other services that our affiliated physicians may order for their patients. The prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral; and therefore, unlike the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, intent to violate the law is not required. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law contains statutory and regulatory exceptions intended to protect certain types of transactions and arrangements. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute with which compliance is voluntary, an arrangement must comply with every requirement of a Stark Law exception or the arrangement is in violation of the Stark Law.

16
--

 

Because the Stark Law and implementing regulations continue to evolve and are detailed and complex, while we attempt to structure its relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, there can be no assurance that the arrangements entered into by us with affiliated physicians and facilities will be found to be in compliance with the Stark Law, as it ultimately may be implemented or interpreted. The penalties for violating the Stark Law can include the denial of payment for services ordered in violation of the statute, mandatory refunds of any sums paid for such services and civil penalties of up to $15,000 for each violation, double damages, and possible exclusion from future participation in the governmental healthcare programs. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibitions may be fined up to $100,000 for each applicable arrangement or scheme.
 
Some states have enacted statutes and regulations against self-referral arrangements similar to the federal Stark Law, but which may be applicable to the referral of patients regardless of their payor source and which may apply to different types of services. These state laws may contain statutory and regulatory exceptions that are different from those of the federal law and that may vary from state to state. An adverse determination under these state laws and/or the federal Stark Law could subject us to different liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other health care programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Health Information Privacy and Security Standards
 
The privacy regulations Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended, contain detailed requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individually identifiable patient health information (“PHI”) by entities like our MSOs and affiliated IPAs and medical groups. HIPAA covered entities must implement certain administrative, physical, and technical security standards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of certain electronic health information received, maintained, or transmitted. HIPAA also implemented standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions, including billing and claim collection activities.
 
Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security rules may result in civil and criminal penalties, including a tiered system of civil money penalties that range from $100 to $50,000 per violation, with a cap of $1.5 million per year for identical violations. A HIPAA covered entity must also promptly notify affected individuals where a breach affects more than 500 individuals and report annually breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals.
 
State attorneys general may bring civil actions on behalf of state residents for violations of the HIPAA privacy and security rules, obtain damages on behalf of state residents and enjoin further violations. Many states also have laws that protect the privacy and security of confidential, personal information, which may be similar to or even more stringent than HIPAA. Some of these state laws may impose fines and penalties on violators and may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused.
 
We expect increased federal and state privacy and security enforcement efforts.
 
Knox-Keene Act and State Insurance Laws
 
The Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (Health and Safety Code Section 1340, et seq.), as amended (the “Knox-Keene Act”), is the California law that regulates managed care plans. Neither our MSOs nor their managed medical groups and IPAs hold a Knox-Keene license. Some of the medical groups and IPAs that have entered into MSAs with our MSOs have historically contracted with health plans and other payors to receive capitation payments and assumed the financial responsibility for professional services. In many of these cases, the health plans or other payors separately enter into contracts with hospitals that receive payments and assume some type of contractual financial responsibility for their institutional services. In some instances, our affiliated medical groups and IPAs have been paid by their contracting payor for the financial outcome of managing the care costs associated with both the professional and institutional services received by patients and have recognized a percentage of the surplus of institutional revenues less institutional expense as the medical groups’ and IPAs’ net revenues and has been responsible for a percentage of any short-fall in the event that institutional expenses exceed institutional revenues. While our MSOs and their managed medical groups and IPAs are not contractually obligated to pay claims to hospitals or other institutions under these arrangements, if it is determined that our MSOs or the medical groups and IPAs have been inappropriately taking financial risk for institutional and professional services without Knox-Keene licenses as a result of their hospital and physician arrangements, we may be required to obtain limited Knox-Keene licenses to resolve such violations and we could be subject to civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
In addition, some states require ACOs to be registered or otherwise comply with state insurance laws. Our ACOs do not currently take financial risk, and are therefore not registered with any state insurance agency. If it is determined that we have been inappropriately operating an ACO without state registration or licensure, we may be required to obtain such registration or licensure to resolve such violations and we could be subject to liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Administration Regulations
 
We are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the storage, use and disposal of waste materials and products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for storing, handling and disposing of these materials and products comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from those hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance coverage, which we may not be able to maintain on acceptable terms, or at all. We could incur significant costs and attention of our management could be diverted to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations. Federal regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration impose additional requirements on us including those protecting employees from exposure to elements such as blood-borne pathogens. We cannot predict the frequency of compliance, monitoring, or enforcement actions to which we may be subject as those regulations are being implemented, which could adversely affect our operations.
Other Federal and State Healthcare Laws
 
We are also subject to other federal and state healthcare laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The Health Care Fraud Statute prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, which can be either a government or private payor plan. Violation of this statute, even in the absence of actual knowledge of or specific intent to violate the statute, may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment or both. The Health Care False Statement Statute prohibits, in any matter involving a federal health care program, anyone from knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up, by any trick, scheme or device, a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any materially false writing or document knowing that it contains a materially false or fraudulent statement. A violation of this statute may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment or both. Under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law of the Social Security Act, a person (including an organization) is prohibited from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented to any United States officer, employee, agent, or department, or any state agency, a claim for payment for medical or other items or services where the person knows or should know (a) the items or services were not provided as described in the coding of the claim, (b) the claim is a false or fraudulent claim, (c) the claim is for a service furnished by an unlicensed physician, (d) the claim is for medical or other items or service furnished by a person or an entity that is in a period of exclusion from the program, or (e) the items or services are medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of the law may result in penalties of up to $10,000 per claim, treble damages, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. In addition, the OIG may impose civil monetary penalties against any physician who knowingly accepts payment from a hospital (as well as against the hospital making the payment) as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services provided to Medicare or Medicaid program beneficiaries. Further, except as permitted under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act.
 
In addition to the state laws previously described, we may also be subject to other state fraud and abuse statutes and regulations if we expand our operations beyond California. Many states have adopted a form of anti-kickback law, self-referral prohibition, and false claims and insurance fraud prohibition. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Generally, state laws reach to all healthcare services and not just those covered under a governmental healthcare program. A determination of liability under any of these laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these states. We cannot assure that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 
Licensure, Certification, Accreditation and Related Laws and Guidelines
 
Our clinical personnel are subject to numerous federal, state and local licensing laws and regulations, relating to, among other things, professional credentialing and professional ethics. Clinical professionals are also subject to state and federal regulation regarding prescribing medication and controlled substances. Our affiliated physicians and hospitalists must satisfy and maintain their individual professional licensing in each state where they practice medicine, including California, and many states require that nurse practitioners and physician assistants work in collaboration with or under the supervision of a physician. Each state defines the scope of practice of clinical professionals through legislation and through the respective Boards of Medicine and Nursing. Activities that qualify as professional misconduct under state law may subject our clinical personnel to sanctions, or to even lose their license and could, possibly, subject us to sanctions as well. Some state boards of medicine impose reciprocal discipline, that is, if a physician is disciplined for having committed professional misconduct in one state where he or she is licensed, another state where he or she is also licensed may impose the same discipline even though the conduct occurred in another state. Since we and our affiliated medical groups perform services at hospitals and other healthcare facilities, we may indirectly be subject to laws, ethical guidelines and operating standards of professional trade associations and private accreditation commissions (such as the American Medical Association and The Joint Commission) applicable to those entities. Penalties for non-compliance with these laws and standards include loss of professional license, civil or criminal fines and penalties, loss of hospital admitting privileges, and exclusion from participation in various governmental and other third-party healthcare programs. In addition, our affiliated facilities are subject to state and local licensing regulations ranging from the adequacy of medical care, to compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. Our ability to operate profitably will depend, in part, upon our ability and the ability of our affiliated physicians and facilities to obtain and maintain all necessary licenses and other approvals and operate in compliance with applicable health care and other laws and regulations that evolve rapidly. We provide home health, hospice and palliative care, which require compliance with additional regulatory requirements.  Reimbursement for palliative care and house call services is generally conditioned on clinical professionals providing the correct procedure and diagnosis codes and properly documenting both the service and the medical necessity for the service. Incorrect or incomplete documentation and billing information, or the incorrect selection of codes for the level and type of service provided, could result in non-payment for services rendered or lead to allegations of billing fraud. We must also comply with laws relating to hospice care eligibility, development and maintenance of care plans and coordination with nursing homes or assisted living facilities where patients live.

Professional Liability and Other Insurance Coverage
 
Our business has an inherent and significant risk of claims of medical malpractice against us and our affiliated physicians. We and our affiliated physician groups pay premiums for third-party professional liability insurance that provides indemnification on a claims-made basis for losses incurred related to medical malpractice litigation in order to carry out our operations. Our physicians are required to carry first dollar coverage with limits of liability equal to not less than $1.0 million for claims based on occurrence up to an aggregate of $3.0 million per year. Our IPAs purchase stop-loss insurance, which will reimburse them for claims from service providers on a per enrollee basis. The specific retention amount per enrollee per policy period is $60,000 to $75,000 for professional coverage. We also maintain worker’s compensation, director and officer, and other third-party insurance coverage subject to deductibles and other restrictions that we believe are in accordance with industry standards. While we believe that our insurance coverage is adequate based upon claims experience and the nature and risks of our business, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of pending or future claims asserted against us or our affiliated physician groups in the future where the outcomes of such claims are unfavorable. The ultimate resolution of pending and future claims in excess of our insurance coverage, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

As of December 31, 2018, ApolloMed and its subsidiaries had 492 employees, of whom 475 were full-time and 17 were part-time, and our consolidated VIEs employed 56 physicians and other staff.
