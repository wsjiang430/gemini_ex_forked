ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
 We are a vertically integrated, clinical stage gene therapy company with five programs in clinical development and a broad pipeline of preclinical and research programs. We have core capabilities in viral vector design and optimization and gene therapy manufacturing, as well as a potentially transformative gene regulation technology. Led by an experienced management team, we have taken a portfolio approach by licensing, acquiring and developing technologies that give us depth across both product candidates and indications. Though initially focusing on the eye, salivary gland and central nervous system, we intend to expand our focus in the future to develop additional gene therapy treatments for patients suffering from a range of serious diseases. 
 We own and operate a flexible and scalable viral vector manufacturing facility that we expect can supply our current clinical and preclinical programs through regulatory approval and, should they be approved, provide sufficient capacity for commercial production. Completed in early 2018 and designed to meet global regulatory requirements, including the current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, our 29,000 square foot facility has two cell production suites, three independent viral vector production suites providing multi-product and multi-viral vector manufacturing capabilities and an integrated, flexible fill-and-finish suite. In May 2018, we were granted a license to manufacture gene therapy product candidates in our cGMP compliant manufacturing facility by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. On December 14, 2018, we acquired from Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust of Moorfields Eye Hospital a long leasehold interest, (the Head Lease), in the site of our manufacturing facility, 92 Britannia Walk, London N1 7LU, for a purchase price of £5,250,000 (approximately $6,615,000 assuming a rate of $1.26 per GBP on the date of the acquisition. As a result of this transaction, we are now the tenant under the Head Lease, which has a remaining term of 108 years, with no facility rent due 
 We have also established a comprehensive platform for the efficient clinical development of the next generation of gene therapies and manufacturing in accordance with cGMP. Our deep understanding of disease models informs our development of potency assays for the cGMP production of our product candidates, and our teams experienced in viral vector design and optimization work closely with our process development team to design viral vectors and develop proprietary production cell lines for efficient scaling of manufacturing processes. 
 We are also developing a potentially transformative technology to enable the use of small molecules to turn gene therapy product candidates on and off. The aim of this gene regulation platform is to convert gene therapy into a generalizable delivery mechanism for biologic drugs using a small molecule switch for temporal control. We believe the capacity for temporal control of gene therapy products has the potential to transform the gene therapy landscape by opening up new treatment possibilities.

 Our Pipeline 
 Our initial focus is on three distinct areas of unmet medical need: inherited retinal diseases, or IRDs, severe forms of xerostomia and neurodegenerative diseases. Utilizing our product development platform, we have assembled a pipeline of gene therapies to treat these serious diseases. Our criteria for selecting our initial product candidates included: 

 | unmet medical need;
--+--------------------


 | high potential for meaningful clinical benefit;
--+------------------------------------------------


 | promising preclinical data using multiple animal models as well as human stem cell derived organoids;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | compartmentalized anatomy of target tissue and the partially immune protected nature of target tissue; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | understanding of the disease state from natural history studies and detailed long-term characterization of patients prior to entry into gene therapy treatment studies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A summary of our product candidates and the status of such product candidates as of March 15, 2019 is described below. We retain worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our product candidates, with the exception of AAV-CNGB3, AAV-CNGA3 and AAV-RPGR, which are subject to a strategic Collaboration, Option and License Agreement (the Collaboration Agreement) that we executed with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson that was executed on January 30, 2019.

In addition to these clinical and preclinical programs, we have preclinical and research programs in other indications and novel molecular technologies that we aim to advance into clinical development, including: 
 

 | neovascular age related macular degeneration, or wet AMD  use of a gene therapy product to deliver an antibody targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, or anti-VEGFR2, with the aim of blocking disease related vascular formation in the eye;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | geographic atrophy age related macular degeneration, or dry AMD  use of gene therapy technology to introduce light sensitive molecules into rod photoreceptors in order to restore some aspects of vision lost in this disease;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALStargeting dysregulation of neuronal RNA, processing, which we believe may lead to the degeneration of motor neurons that occurs in ALS;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Alzheimers diseasetargeting endosomal trafficking, which is a central mechanism that we believe underlies Alzheimers disease; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | gene regulationuse of our proprietary RNA shape regulation cassette to switch gene therapy product candidates on and off with small molecules, potentially transforming gene therapy technology into a delivery mechanism for a broad array of biologic drugs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our Ophthalmology Programs 
 Eye diseases are our first area of clinical focus and we aim to provide treatments with durable, long-term clinical benefit that will halt vision loss in patients. We currently have three ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical programs in IRDs, with an additional program expected to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in 2019. The targets of our three ongoing Phase 1/2 ophthalmology programs include achromatopsia, or ACHM, related to mutations in CNGB3, X-linked retinitis pigmentosa related to mutations in RPGR, or XLRP-RPGR, and inherited retinal dystrophy caused by mutations in RPE65, or RPE65-deficiency. We also have a product candidate that was manufactured and released for compassionate use under a specials license in the United Kingdom to treat patients with Leber congenital amaurosis 4, or LCA4, caused by mutations in AIPL1. For each of our Phase 1/2 clinical programs we have a prospectively designed natural history study ongoing, which includes the same endpoints as our corresponding gene therapy treatment trial. We believe use of these natural history studies differentiates our programs by providing patient populations to facilitate the efficient execution of our clinical trials and offering insight into the appropriate endpoints for regulatory approval of our gene therapy product candidates. In addition to these clinical programs in IRDs, we have preclinical programs that apply novel approaches to both wet and dry AMD. 
 The FDA and EMA have granted orphan drug designation to each product candidate in our ongoing clinical programs, including those treating mutations in CNGB3, RPGR and RPE65, as well our product candidates for the treatment of achromatopsia due to autosomal-recessive CNGA3 gene mutations and to treat mutations in AIPL1. The FDA has also granted rare pediatric disease designation for our clinical programs treating mutations in RPE65 and CNGB3 and our product candidate for the treatment of autosomal-recessive CNGA3 gene mutations, and Fast Track designation to our clinical programs for the treatment of achromatopsia caused by CNGB3 gene mutations to improve visual function and for the treatment of XLRP caused by mutations in RPGR. We have also received PRIME designation from the EMA for our clinical program treating mutations in CNGB3. 
 The deep scientific and clinical understanding of IRDs driving our approach to gene therapy development helps us to optimize our product candidates for each specific genetic mutation and phenotype. We develop our viral vectors by selecting and modifying proprietary cell specific promoters, selecting appropriate capsids for transfection of target cells and refining the vector for efficient production and scalable manufacturing. Not only does this allow us to synergistically target a portfolio of inherited eye conditions, we also believe it has potential to be applied to the development of gene therapies for other diseases. 
 Our longstanding relationships with leading institutions in retinal disease treatment, including the Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, the Medical College of Wisconsin & Froedtert Hospital and the Casey Eye Institute at the Oregon Health & Science University, provide us with access to experts whose guidance and insight informs our development strategy, as well potential patients for our clinical trials. 
 Our Salivary Gland Programs 
 Our second area of clinical focus is xerostomia, a chronic and debilitating disorder of the salivary glands in which saliva production is impaired. Xerostomia may be caused by a number of different insults to the salivary glands, including radiation therapy for head and neck cancer and certain autoimmune diseases. A Phase 1 clinical trial of our gene therapy product candidate, AAV-AQP1, is ongoing in patients who have survived cancer free for five or more years following treatment for head and neck cancer and are suffering from grade 2 or 3 radiation induced late xerostomia, or RIX. There are approximately 170,000 grade 2 or 3 RIX patients who have survived two or more years after radiation treatment for head and neck cancer in the United States, with approximately 10,000 new cases each year. We also intend to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AAV-AQP1 for the treatment of patients with chronic xerostomia caused by Sjogrens syndrome, an autoimmune disease affecting more than two million people in the United States. 
 The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to AAV-AQP1.

6 


 Our Neurodegenerative Disease Programs 
 Neurodegenerative diseases are our third area of focus. Our first target indication is Parkinsons disease, where we have Phase 2 clinical data from a successful randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial. Our product candidate targeting Parkinsons disease, AAV-GAD, is designed to deliver the glutamic acid decarboxylase, or GAD, gene to the subthalamic nucleus in order to increase production of GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain. GAD is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of GABA, therefore we believe that increasing subthalamic nucleus GAD expression through gene therapy has the potential to result in normalization of motor circuits and improve symptoms in Parkinsons disease patients without affecting other brain regions, which can be responsible for complications of existing therapies. To date, we have not had any formal meetings with regulatory agencies nor determined the regulatory pathway and any potential related development costs for our recently acquired AAV-GAD gene therapy program for Parkinsons disease. 
 Our second target indication is ALS, where we currently have IND-enabling studies ongoing. We believe our approach to treating ALS patients is differentiated because, rather than targeting a specific genetic defect that defines a small subset of ALS patients, we aim to target the underlying cell biology driving motor neuron death in ALS, potentially enabling us to treat a broader patient population that includes both sporadic and inherited forms of the disease. Increasing evidence suggests a critical role of RNA metabolism in neuronal cells, in particular in motor neurons that are specifically affected in ALS. We believe that dysregulation of neuronal RNA processes results in the degeneration of motor neurons that leads to ALS. Using our viral vector product candidate, AAV-UPF1, we target the central quality control system regulating RNA in motor neurons with the aim of enhancing motor neuron survival in ALS patients. 
 We have an Alzheimers disease program that is likewise directed towards the underlying cell biology of the disease, in this case endosomal trafficking, a mechanism cells use to cycle proteins to the cell surface. Over the past decade, evidence has emerged supporting endosomal trafficking dysfunction in neurons as a central process in the early etiology of Alzheimers disease. In particular, a master regulator of trafficking out of the endosomes, called retromer, has been implicated. We are in the process of identifying what we believe to be the optimal approach to restoring normal endosomal function to the neurons that are the first to be affected in Alzheimers. In parallel, we are developing and validating biomarkers of endosomal dysfunction and pre-symptomatic Alzheimers disease. We believe this approach may also provide a framework for treating certain forms of Parkinsons disease that are also associated with endosomal dysfunction. 
 Our Strengths 
 In addition to our four ongoing clinical programs, we have a broad pipeline of preclinical programs, core capabilities in viral vector design and optimization, gene therapy manufacturing and a potentially transformative gene regulation technology. Utilizing the following key strengths, we aim to develop, commercialize and expand our portfolio of product candidates. 

 | Deep Expertise in Gene Therapy Development: We believe our expertise in viral vector design, optimization and process development allows us to efficiently advance gene therapy products candidates from preclinical development to cGMP manufacturing and clinical development through commercialization.

We believe the capacity for temporal control of gene therapy products has the potential to transform the gene therapy landscape by opening up new treatment possibilities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Manufacturing Capabilities and Capacity: We have a flexible and scalable cGMP manufacturing facility and production process, which we expect can supply all of our current clinical and preclinical programs through regulatory approval and, should they be approved, provide sufficient capacity for their commercial production.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to develop and commercialize innovative gene therapy products to treat serious disorders and broaden the scope of indications that may be treatable by our gene therapies. Our strategy to achieve this goal is to: 

 | successfully complete clinical development, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our pipeline of gene therapy product candidates to treat disorders of the eye and salivary gland;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gene Therapy Overview 
 Gene therapy uses a delivery vehicle, referred to as a vector, to insert a functionally active gene into cells in the body. The gene encodes a therapeutic protein that may block disease pathways or may enhance a deficient pathway. Gene therapy has been studied for over 50 years, with a variety of different viral vectors employed to deliver therapeutic genes. Since the first clinical study of therapeutic gene transfer in humans in 1990, more than 2,300 gene therapy studies covering a broad range of disease targets have been initiated. Recently, the first gene therapies have received regulatory approval, including approval by the FDA of Luxturna for an ophthalmology condition, resulting in a growing acceptance of gene therapy technology as a potentially safe and effective therapeutic approach. 
 Our current programs use the adeno-associated virus, or AAV, as the vector for delivering gene sequences into a patients cells. The key components of an AAV vector include: (i) the capsid, or the outer viral protein shell that encloses the target DNA, which is responsible for binding to the cell surface and allowing the therapeutic gene that it is carrying to enter the cell; (ii) the therapeutic gene, or transgene, that encodes the therapeutic protein; and (iii) the promoter, or the DNA sequence that drives the expression of the transgene. AAV is a good vector for gene therapy delivery because of its relative safety and broad applicability. AAV is less immunogenic, or less prone to causing an immune reaction, than previous generations of gene therapy vectors, such as adenoviral vectors and AAV does not readily integrate into the genome of the target cell, reducing the potential for oncogenesis, or the induction of cancer. AAV vectors can transfer a therapeutic gene into, or transduce, numerous cell types. Slight differences in capsid proteins can modulate the efficiency with which 
 
9 


  different capsids deliver genes to different cells, thus allowing different AAV capsids to be selected to most effectively target particular cell types. 
 The therapeutic gene sequence that enters the targeted cell includes both the protein coding region and an engineered promoter sequence that is used to drive functional gene expression. These engineered promoters may be designed to drive different levels of gene expression or to limit gene expression to specific cell types. Additional aspects of the transgene sequence may be engineered for optimal gene expression, such as codon usage and synthetic introns, which may enhance levels of therapeutic protein expression. 
 Gene therapy can be used to address monogenic diseases, which result mutations in a single gene in a patients genome. In such cases, the viral vector is used to deliver a normal copy of the gene to the cells that are defective due to the lack of the gene function. The normal gene then drives production of the missing protein and offers a therapeutic benefit in patients with the disease. This gene replacement approach underlies all of our clinical IRD programs. 
 Rather than replacing a gene that is defective or missing in a monogenic disease, gene therapy can also provide a therapeutic impact by adding a particular new gene function to cells and thereby change cell behavior and function. This is the aim of our salivary gland programs, where our treatment is designed to promote water to flow through otherwise impermeable cells in damaged salivary glands and increase saliva flow into the mouth. Additionally, gene therapy may be used to deliver a therapeutic protein that may block a disease pathway or enhance a deficient cellular pathway in multifactorial diseases such as wet AMD and neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS and Alzheimers disease. 
 Importantly, AAV vectors enable targeting of therapeutic genes to non-dividing cells, in which they are thought to remain for the rest of the cells life. This means that a single treatment may offer patients a durable effect and long-term benefit. The specific cells of the eye, salivary gland and the neurons that we target in our current gene therapy programs are largely non-dividing cells and preclinical evidence has shown that they can be effectively targeted by the specific AAV capsids that we use, enabling us to potentially achieve a durable impact on each of the diseases that we treat. 
 Our Ophthalmology Programs 
 Overview and Strategy 
 We currently have three ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical programs targeting IRDs, including ACHM related to mutations in CNGB3, XLRP-RPGR and RPE65-deficiency, with an additional program expected to enter a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in 2019 in patients with ACHM related to mutations in CNGA3. We also have a product candidate that was manufactured and released for compassionate use under a specials license in the UK to treat LCA4 patients. We chose diseases of the eye as our first area of clinical focus because we believe the eye is ideally suited for gene therapy for the following reasons. 

 | The eye is easily accessible and has highly compartmentalized anatomy, which allows for accurate delivery of vectors to specific tissues using direct visualization and microsurgical techniques.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The structure of the eye allows for efficient delivery to specific cell subtypes with small volumes of vector, making the dose per patient much lower than for systemic treatment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Anatomical barriers and unique structure of the eye make the immune response to the intraocular administration of vectors more attenuated than systemic administration.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Largely non-dividing cell populations in the eye make good targets for potentially stable, long-term gene delivery and expression.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The retina, a structure in the back of the eye, is visible and there are many well validated structural and functional readouts allowing the detailed assessment of the therapeutic impact of the gene therapy treatment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our strategy for developing gene therapies targeting eye diseases is to begin with a number of monogenic IRDs that are good candidates for gene replacement therapies and expand to more common eye diseases over time. We have taken a portfolio approach to the development of IRDs because, while some of these genetic defects are rare, IRDs as a class are one of the most common causes of blindness in working age adults and there are multiple synergies at the clinical, regulatory and commercial levels between many of these diseases caused by different gene mutations. 
 Two of our clinical-stage product candidates are targeting IRD indications in achromatopsia caused by mutations in the CNGB3 gene and inherited retinal dystrophy caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene. The primary defect in these particular genetic disorders is the absence of function of one of the two different types of photoreceptors that constitute the light sensing part of the retina, rods or cones. In achromatopsia, the cones completely lack function, while in RPE65-deficiency it is the rods that lack function. In these indications, we anticipate that restoring a normal copy of the mutant gene to the retina of patients with these genetic disorders may restore function to the particular type of photoreceptor that is defective in each of these indications. Although cone photoreceptors are generally preserved during childhood in RPE65-deficient patients, the lack of healthy active rods eventually affects the cones that they support and over time both rods and cones die, the retina degenerates and RPE65-deficient patients become totally blind. 
 We also have a clinical-stage product candidate for XLRP-RPGR, in which all photoreceptors, both rods and cones, function poorly, leading to degeneration of the retina and total blindness. We have used data and learnings from our RPE65 studies to inform the design and techniques used in our XLRP-RPGR program. The aim of our XLRP-RPGR treatment is to slow the degeneration of the retina, which we measure using validated surrogate structural endpoints and changes in the detailed structural maps of these patients retinas over time. 
 In order to expand our gene therapy pipeline for retinal diseases, we are also developing treatments for certain multifactorial eye diseases, which are diseases caused by multiple genetic or environmental factors. We have a preclinical program using an anti-VEGFR2 antibody targeting wet AMD and we are currently conducting IND-enabling studites for this program. We are also working to integrate our gene regulation technology with our wet AMD program. Our ultimate aim is to activate the anti-VEGFR2 antibody gene that we have installed in the eye with a small molecule applied topically in an eye drop. This could potentially allow for intermittent dosing of the antibody using an eye drop rather than injection. Additionally, we are developing a novel approach to treat advanced dry AMD patients who have lost central vision through our innovative rod-to-cone technology. By genetically engineering rods with molecules that will improve their speed of response to light, we aim to effectively transform a patch of rod photoreceptors in the outer part of the retina to behave more like cone photoreceptors, thus improving vision. 
 We intend to leverage our platform to take advantage of the many synergies across our ophthalmology programs, including identification, diagnosis and characterization of patients, specialized surgical techniques, clinical and regulatory process, vector production and cGMP manufacturing, as well as commercial synergies, if these product candidates are approved by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. 
 Our Competitive Advantage: Natural History Studies, Relationships with Leading Institutions and Our cGMP Manufacturing Facility 
 IRDs as a class are the most common cause of blindness in the working age population worldwide and a leading cause of impaired vision in children in developed countries. There are approximately 200,000 people in each of the United States and European Union affected by IRDs. However, IRDs may be caused by mutations in over 200 identified genes, and in many cases each genetically defined IRD may be a small patient population. Meaningful clinical trials for these sorts of rare indications are especially challenging because they require access to sufficient patients and baseline data on each patient in order to secure clear indicators of efficacy as a result of intervention. We seek to address this problem by sponsoring prospectively designed natural history studies in each of the indications that we are treating in our Phase 1/2 trials. 
 
11 


 The lead investigator for the natural history studies is Michel Michaelides, Professor of Ophthalmology at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London. For each of the natural history studies, baseline assessments are made upon enrollment, with follow up assessments at six-month intervals for two years and annual assessments for up to an additional three years. A broad range of assessments are used, including functional tests, retinal imaging and electrophysiological assessments. The same assessments used for each natural history study are used in our corresponding clinical trial targeting the same indication, allowing us to compare the impact of our product candidates on the progression of these diseases on a population, as well as individual patient basis. 
 We expect the natural history studies will enhance our understanding of disease progression for each indication that we are targeting and allow us to identify optimal windows for intervention, provide specific functional and structural parameters to quantify treatment effects and define clinical endpoints. These studies also provide us with a source of potential patients for our treatment studies and have facilitated efficient enrollment of these studies. These patients are not only genotyped, but also have up to five years of detailed functional and structural assessment data prior to enrollment into an appropriate treatment study. 
 We also have longstanding active relationships and clinical site agreements with leading institutions in retinal disorder treatments, including Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, the Medical College of Wisconsin & Froedtert Hospital and the Casey Eye Institute at the Oregon Health & Science University. Our relationships with these institutions, in most cases, precede the date on which we entered into a clinical site agreement with the applicable institution. Professor Robin Ali, Ph.D., our Head of Preclinical Ophthalmology and one of our founders, is Professor of Human Molecular Genetics at UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and Theme Leader for Gene Therapy at NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Opthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, and a Visiting Professor at the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center. These institutions are among the premier treatment centers for the indications that we are pursuing and provide us with access to potential patients for our clinical trials and experts in IRDs who offer strategic guidance and expertise for our development strategy. These institutions provide services with respect to our preclinical and clinical studies. For example, all of our IRD clinical trials are being conducted at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center and Massachusetts Eye and Ear Hospital in Boston. Participants enrolled at the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center and Massachusetts Eye and Ear Hospital may travel to the Medical College of Wisconsin & Froedtert Hospital for adaptive optic assessments. The Casey Eye Institute at the Oregon Health & Science University provides certain reading center and other clinical services with respect to our clinical trials. Achromatopsia 
 Disease Background and Market Opportunity 
 Achromatopsia, or ACHM, is an IRD that specifically prevents cone photoreceptors from functioning. ACHM patients are legally blind from birth and usually suffer from severely reduced visual acuity of 20/200 or worse, a disabling sensitivity to light, or photoaversion, total color blindness and involuntary back and forth eye movements, or nystagmus. 
 Cones and rods are the two kinds of photoreceptors in the human eye. Photoreceptors are light-sensitive cells that absorb light and convert it into an electrical signal that is transmitted to the brain for the perception of light, or vision. Rods can detect very low levels of light and are quickly inactivated in higher light levels, enabling vision in dim light. Cones, on the other hand, remain active in high light levels and support daytime vision and the perception of color. Even though only 5% of the photoreceptors in the eye are cones, they are concentrated in the central part of the retina, the macula, where they are tightly packed, thus enabling high-acuity daytime vision. The highest cone density is in the centermost spot of the macula, called the fovea. Since cones are essential for central visual acuity, color vision, and most daily visual activities, ACHM patients suffer significant vision loss due to the complete lack of cone function. 
 ACHM occurs in approximately one in 30,000 people in the United States. To date, mutations of any one of six genes encoding components of the light sensing machinery of cone photoreceptors have been 
 
12 


  identified as causing ACHM. The CNGB3 and CNGA3 genes are the two most common of these genes, together accounting for up to 92% of ACHM cases, with CNGB3 slightly more common than CNGA3 in most geographic territories. Together, the proteins encoded by the CNGB3 and CNGA3 genes make up the cone-specific cyclic nucleotide gated, or CNG, channel, which is essential for cones to produce an electrical signal in response to light. Mutations in either of these genes prevent the formation of the CNG channel. 
 There are estimated to be approximately 12,000 patients with ACHM caused by mutations in CNGB3 in the United States, Japan and Germany, France, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom, or the EU5, with about 25% of those patients being under the age of 18 and approximately 125 new cases being diagnosed annually. We believe the availability of a therapeutic option may increase patient identification and the estimated prevalence of ACHM. 
 Our Gene Therapy Program 
 We have designed specifically optimized gene therapy viral vector candidates to treat ACHM caused by mutations in each of CNGB3 and CNGA3, with which we aim to address the majority of patients suffering from ACHM. Our product candidates are delivered via subretinal injection covering the central macula region of the eye, where most of the cones in the retina are located. 
 ACHM is predominantly a stationary disease, which means that ACHM patients retinas contain non-functioning cones that survive intact for many decades. This is in contrast to many IRDs in which the entire retina slowly degenerates over a patients life. This extended survival of cones with their potential for light sensitivity presents a wide window of opportunity to introduce a normal copy of the mutated gene via a gene therapy product candidate and thereby restore cone function. While the stationary nature of ACHM means that cones remain present for decades, the functional connections between active cones and the visual cortex in the brain are thought to become fixed in teenage years. Therefore, we believe that younger individuals are likely to benefit most from gene therapy treatment for ACHM because of their greater visual plasticity. Another debilitating symptom of ACHM, which lasts throughout life, is photoaversion. A disabling and ubiquitous symptom of ACHM, photoaversion is the avoidance of light due to discomfort in the presence of levels of light equivalent to a normally lit room or daylight. ACHM patients often avoid light and wear dark glasses, which further diminishes their already very poor vision. We believe it is possible that restoration of cone function in adult patients might have an impact on photoaversion even if brain plasticity is limited. 
 We believe that gene therapy treatment for ACHM in which we aim to restore cone function via a gene replacement strategy may offer benefits across a range of ages, which we aim to define in our clinical development programs. 
 ACHM Caused by Mutations in CNGB3 
 With our collaborators at the University College of Londons Institute of Ophthalmology, or UCL IO, led by Professor Robin Ali, we have developed a product candidate to treat ACHM caused by mutations in the CNGB3 gene. Mutations in the CNGB3 gene prevent cone photoreceptors from functioning because CNGB3s gene product is integral to the formation of a specific membrane channel that enables cones electrical response to light. CNGB3 is a gene exclusively expressed in cones and our aim is to replace the absent function of the mutant CNGB3 gene with a normal copy of the gene in cones of IRD patients and thereby restore cone function. In order to drive expression of the functional gene specifically in cones and not in other cells of the retina, we use the cone specific human cone arrestin, or CAR, promoter to drive the expression of a codon optimized CNGB3 cDNA. Codon optimization improves protein expression by increasing translation efficiency. To transfect cone photoreceptors, we use the AAV8 capsid, which enables the efficient delivery of the CNGB3 gene cargo to those photoreceptors. As the vast majority of the cones in the eye are located centrally and concentrated in the macula, we treat this central region of the retina through subretinal injection to deliver the viral vector product candidate to the photoreceptors in which its activity is required.

 Preclinical studies in mice lacking the Cngb3 gene were carried out by our collaborators at UCL IO and led by Professor Robin Ali in 2010 and 2011 and the data was published in Human Molecular Genetics in 2011. In these studies, it was observed that delivery of our CNGB3 product candidate, AAV-CNGB3, via subretinal injection at doses between 6E9 and 8E9 viral genomes per eye, or vg/eye, was associated with a restoration of cone function to near normal levels. 
 In one of these studies, retinal response to light was measured in three groups of mice: Cngb3 mutant mice treated with AAV-CNGB3, untreated Cngb3 mutant mice and normal mice. Mice were treated with AAV-CNGB3 vector dosed at 2E12 vg/mL (8E9 vg/eye) via subretinal injection. One eye was treated per mouse. Vector was administered when mice were 30 days old, and electrical responses, or ERGs, of the retina were measured 90 days following administration of the vector. 
 Figure 1 shows representative ERG responses of the retina to different light stimuli: a single flash of bright light (1A; 1B; 1C) and repeated pulses, or flickers, of bright light at different frequencies to assess the refresh rate of the photoreceptors (1A; 1B; 1C). Retinas from three different groups of mice were tested: retinas of normal mice (Figure 1A), retinas of mutant mice lacking the Cngb3 gene (Figure 1B) and retinas of mutant mice lacking the Cngb3 gene, but treated with AAV-CNGB3 (Figure 1C). It was observed that the response to a bright light pulse was largely absent in the retinas of Cngb3 mutant mice, as this response is largely mediated by the cones and is therefore severely impacted by the Cngb3 mutation (Figure 1B). It was also observed that treatment of Cngb3 mutant mice with AAV-CNGB3 was associated with a high-degree of restored cone function in these mutant mouse retinas in response to a single flash of bright light (Figure 1C). In addition, we tested the response of cones to rapid flickers of bright light (Figure 1A1) because only cones can register multiple sequential signals from rapid flickers. It was observed that registering rapid flickers was also impacted by the Cngb3 mutation (Figure 1B1) and the cone flicker response was nearly completely restored in the retinas of Cngb3 mutant mice following treatment with AAV-CNGB3 (Figure 1C1).

 Figure 1C and 1C1. The electrical responses of the retina from a mutant mouse lacking Cngb3 treated with AAV-CNGB3 reacting to a flash of bright light and flickers. Treatment with AAV-CNGB3 was associated with a high degree of restoration of cone function, with the electrical response to a bright flash of light and rapid flickers nearly matching the response observed in the normal mouse retina. 
 In another one of the preclinical studies carried out by our collaborators at UCL IO, it was assessed whether functional improvement at the retinal level of Cngb3 mutant mice was impacted by the age of the mice at the time treatment with the gene therapy product candidate. In this study, Cngb3-mutant mice were treated with AAV-CNGB3 at 30 days old, the P30 group, or 180 days old, the P180 group. One eye was treated in each mouse via subretinal injection dosed at 2E12 vg/mL (8E9 vg/eye). Optomotor measurements were taken 60 days after treatment of the P30 group of the Cngb3 mutant mice treated with AAV-CNGB3 (n=11), untreated Cngb3 mutant mice (n=11) and normal, age-matched untreated mice (n=5). Optomotor measurements were also taken 60 days after the treatment of the P180 group of the Cngb3 mutant mice treated with AAV-CNGB3 (n=6), untreated Cngb3 mutant mice (n=6) and normal, age-matched untreated mice (n=5). Optomoter assessments were made by placing each mouse on a pedestal located in the center of four inward facing computer screens, that projected a rotating image. The head-tracking responses of each mouse was observed using an overhead infrared video camera. Visual acuity was measured by involuntary reflex head-tracking responses driven by the left (clockwise rotations, black arrow) and right (counter-clockwise rotations, white arrow) eyes, respectively (Figure 2A). 
 Figure 2B is a graph comparing the visual acuity as measured by the average optomotor assessment of the normal eyes, eyes from Cngb3 mutant mice treated with AAV-CNGB3 and eyes from Cngb3-mutant mice that were untreated. It was observed that Cngb3 mutant mice had a significantly lower visual acuity than normal mice. However, after treatment with AAV-CNGB3, visual acuity in the Cngb3 mutant mice eyes treated at 30 days old was observed to be restored to a similar level as that observed in normal mice. In contrast, no significant difference in visual acuity between the treated and untreated eyes was observed when treatment was given at 180 days old. Data from this study suggests that treatment received at an older age is less capable of restoring visual acuity.

Each mouse was placed on a pedestal located in the center of four inward facing screens and was observed by an overhead infrared video camera. The assessments were made 60 days following treatment of the Cngb3 mutant mice with AAV-CNGB3 at 30 days old and 180 days old.

 Between October 2016 and December 2016, we carried out a dose-ranging preclinical study at UCL IO to determine the efficacy of different doses of AAV-CNGB3 in rescuing cone response to a single pulse of bright 
 
15 


  light in Cngb3 mutant mice as measured by electrical responses across the retina, or ERG. The study was conducted to support a planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with CNGB3 mutations following the FDAs request for additional rescue data at a range of different doses. While long-term functional rescue was observed in prior tests, there was no dosage titration tested in those studies. The data from this study has not been published. 
 We assessed cone-mediated ERG responses in Cngb3 mutant mice at three doses and compared these responses to baseline recordings of untreated eyes at two different time-points following treatment. Cngb3 mutant mice were administered AAV-CNGB3 via subretinal injection of 4uL of vector at each dose. Mice were treated at four weeks of age and ERG responses were measured in these mice at four weeks and eight weeks following treatment. Three eyes were treated at each of the three doses, and three eyes were untreated. The reviewer analyzing the ERG traces was masked to which eye received treatment. 
 Figure 3 shows the photopic ERG amplitudes measured to assess cone photoreceptor function in Cngb3 mutant mice treated with AAV-CNGB3 at 1E11 vg/mL (4E8 vg/eye; n=3), 3E11 vg/mL (1.2E9 vg/eye; n=3) and 1E12 vg/mL (4E9 vg/eye; n=3), and untreated eyes (n=3) at four and eight weeks post administration. A photopic ERG is the electrical response of the retina corresponding to cone electrical activity following a single pulse of bright light (single ERG recordings are shown in Figure 1). The higher the ERG amplitude, the greater the response of the retina to bright light. These data show a statistically significant increase in cone ERG responses for all three doses of AAV-CNGB3 and for both time-points following vector administration except for low dose at four weeks post injection (p=0.051). These data indicate that AAV-CNGB3 is associated with the rescue of the cone electrical response in the retina of Cngb3 mutant mice in a dose-responsive fashion. While initial responses were observed in mice four weeks after subretinal injection of the vector, at all three doses significantly stronger ERG responses were observed eight weeks after vector administration, with the maximum ERG response observed at the highest dose eight weeks after administration. 
 In this study, a dose response in ERG amplitudes from treated eyes was observed, suggesting that increasing amounts of AAV-CNGB3 is associated with greater rescue of responses in Cngb3 mutant mice. The three doses tested in this study are the same as those doses administered in our AAV-CNGB3 Phase 1/2 clinical trial on a vg/mL of viral vector titer basis.

Figure 3. Graph of averaged photopic ERG amplitudes at four and eight week time-points post administration of AAV-CNGB in Cngb3 mutant mice treated at four weeks of age. The blue line indicates the electrical response amplitudes observed following administration of different doses of AAV-CNGB3 measured at four weeks after treatment. The red line shows the increased level of electrical response observed in the same mice treated with AAV-CNGB3 four weeks later, at eight weeks following treatment. This is compared to the ERG response in untreated eyes, which remained unchanged at both time points. 
 During 2016, we conducted three preclinical toxicology studies of AAV-CNGB3 at UCL IO. We conducted a nine-month study in normal mice in which four eyes were dosed with saline as a control, nine eyes were dosed at 2E9 vg/eye, and nine eyes were dosed at 4E9 vg/eye, with a toxicology assessment at one, three, six and nine months post-administration. We also conducted an eight week study in normal mice, in which 15 mice were dosed with saline as a control, 15 mice were dosed at 2E9 vg/eye, and 15 mice were dosed at 4E9 vg/eye, providing five mice from each group for studying local and systemic effects at each time-point of one, four and eight weeks after treatment. We also conducted an eight week rabbit study in which the right eyes of nine animals were dosed with saline as a control, the right eyes of nine animals were dosed at 0.8E11 vg/eye and the right eyes of nine animals were dosed at 2.4E11 vg/eye, providing three animals from each dose group for studying local and systemic effects at each time-point of one, four and eight weeks after treatment. Biodistribution was examined in the eight-week mouse and rabbit studies. No harmful effects on the retina or systemically were observed at the time-points listed after treatment. The data from these studies have not been published. We used these data to support our clinical trial application, or CTA, and IND for treatment of patients with ACHM related to CNGB3 mutations with AAV-CNGB3.
Clinical Development of AAV-CNGB3
We have an ongoing natural history study in ACHM including over 90 patients that allows us to collect structural and functional data for up to five years on prospectively defined endpoints, including functional tests (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, mobility maze and photoaversion assessments), retinal imaging (color fundus photography, fundus autofluoresence imaging, spectral domain optical coherence tomography and visual field 
 
17 


  testing) and electrophysiological assessments. The study center is the Moorfields Eye Hospital in London. We believe access to these ACHM patients has enabled us to efficiently enroll the most appropriate patients into our CNGB3 Phase 1/2 clinical trial. We intend to present this natural history data to regulatory agencies for discussion of our pivotal trial design and path to regulatory approval. In addition to giving us access to patients and potentially accelerated enrollment in our treatment studies, we believe the prospective natural history data on each treated patient allow us to gather robust data from our Phase 1/2 clinical trial in a condensed timeframe. 
 We are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AAV-CNGB3 in both adult and pediatric patients. In the dose escalation phase of the trial, up to 18 adult patients (18 years or older) may be administered one of three different doses of vector in dose escalating cohorts of three to six patients at a time. We have treated patients in all three dose cohorts. We have also treated one pediatric patient in the expansion cohort of the trial. We will close out this trial six months after the last pediatric patient has been treated. Six months following treatment, each patient moves onto a long term follow up study in which they are followed for safety and indication of benefit for an additional four and a half years. 
 The primary endpoint of this open-label, dose-escalation clinical trial is the safety of a one-time subretinal administration of AAV-CNGB3 in patients with ACHM caused by CNGB3 mutations. Secondary endpoints include the outcomes of a range of functional assessments and detailed structural analysis of the retina, including imaging of individual photoreceptors. 
 This trial is open in the United Kingdom and the United States. We have treated 11 adult patients, including three patients at the highest proposed dose, and nine pediatric patients. 
 We submitted our IND for AAV-CNGB3 to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2017. The IND was initially not opened because we received a question from the FDA regarding our injection device compatibility assay, thus putting the IND on clinical hold until we satisfactorily answered the FDAs question and the clinical hold was lifted by the FDA. In the device compatibility assay the FDA noted a disparity between the target titer for the intended low dose dilution and the actual titer obtained on polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, analysis. The FDA requested clarification on whether this was an imprecise dilution scheme for the low dose or a PCR assay issue. We submitted a response to the FDA on May 2, 2018 providing data that identified the issue as a PCR assay artifact and also showing data that we believe supports that this has now been addressed. On May 31, 2018 the FDA released the clinical hold on our IND for AAV-CNGB3.
In this trial, AAV-CNGB3 viral vector is delivered via subretinal injection of up to 0.5mL targeting the central region of the retina, including the macula and fovea, where most of the cones are located. One eye is treated in each patient, which is the eye assessed to be the worst eye at baseline. We completed the dose escalation phase of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial, with 11 adult patients treated. These 11 patients were dosed in three cohorts with escalating doses of 1E11 vg/mL (cohort one), 3E11 vg/mL (cohort two) and 1E12 vg/mL (cohort three) of AAV-CNGB3. In addition, nine pediatric patients have now been treated in the extension phase of the study. 
 In each of the 11 adult patients treated and nine pediatric patients treated, the macula, including the fovea, was covered by the subretinal injection. Subretinal injections have been administered by three different surgeons at the Moorfields Eye Hospital in London and the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center in the United States. 
 In adult and pediatric CNGB3 patients, treatment of the central retina with our AAV-CNGB3 product candidate via subretinal injection has been generally well tolerated. Data from the first adult treatment cohort along with our preclinical data of AAV-CNGB3 was used to support our PRIME designation that was awarded by the EMA in February 2018. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had completed dosing of eleven adult patients and nine pediatric patients. We may treat up to four additional patients in the United States during the first quarter of 2019. We 
 
18 


  expect to release data from the adult dose escalation cohorts along with preliminary six-month data from the pediatric patients in the second half of 2019. 
 Our CNGB3 gene therapy product candidate, AAV-CNGB3, was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and EMA, rare pediatric disease designation by the FDA for the treatment of achromatopsia caused by mutations in the CNGB3 gene, and Fast Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of achromatopsia caused by CNGB3 mutations to improve visual function. We have also been granted PRIME designation by the EMA. 
 ACHM Caused by Mutations in CNGA3 
 We are also developing AAV-CNGA3 to treat ACHM caused by mutations in the CNGA3 gene. While the mechanism for treating CNGA3 related ACHM is similar to that for CNGB3, we believe a larger amount of CNGA3 protein is required to restore cone function compared to CNGB3. We believe this may reflect the 1:3 ratio in which CNGB3: CNGA3 subunits associate to form the cone CNG channel. We have designed a synthetic promoter to drive high levels of CNGA3 expression specifically in cones. In preclinical studies, our novel cone specific promoter has been associated with strong gene expression in all human cone subtypes in human retinas grown in vitro using human pluripotent stem cells, or hPSC. AAV-CNGA3 utilizes this proprietary pan cone promoter to drive a codon optimized CNGA3 gene sequence. We believe this novel promoter can drive sufficient expression of CNGA3 in cones to restore light sensitivity to these cones in CNGA3 deficient patients. We use the AAV8 capsid to transfect cone photoreceptors in the back of the eye and we target the cones concentrated in the central region of the retina via a subretinal injection that covers the macula. 
 A key aspect of developing an effective treatment for ACHM caused by CNGA3 mutations is a promoter that drives robust gene expression in all of the three different cone subtypes, S/blue, L/red and M/green. In particular, it is important to evaluate the activity of the promoter in human photoreceptors, which can be achieved prior to treating patients using human stem cell derived retinas. Our relationship with UCL provides access to what we believe is one of the few centers in the world that can generate human mini retinas, or HMRs, which are human retinas grown in vitro from hPSCs. These HMRs develop from stem cells over several months to form primary photoreceptors arrayed in a spherical structure that resembles many aspects of the human retina and includes all the rod and cone subtypes, allowing us to assess and predict the utility of many aspects of gene therapy vectors for human clinical application. 
 In vitro studies to measure the gene expression driven by our cone specific promoter in human cones using HMRs were conducted at UCL IO during 2017. Figure 4A shows a fully formed HMR that has been transfected with a construct in which our cone specific promoter was associated with the expression of green fluorescent protein, or GFP, a green marker gene. The expression of GFP is seen specifically in cone photoreceptors throughout this HMR, indicating that our promoter is driving robust gene expression in human cones. To support that this promoter drives gene expression in all cone subtypes, GFP expression driven by our promoter was overlaid with markers specific to each of the cone types. Figure 4B is an image of an S/blue cone and Figure 4C is an image of an L/red cone and an M/green cone, with the cone-specific marker labeled in red in each case. The multiple colors in Figures 4B and 4C show the overlay of these cone-specific markers with cone specific GFP expression, indicating that our promoter drives gene expression in all cone subtypes in this HMR. The data from these studies have not been published.

 In preclinical studies of mutant mice lacking the Cnga3 gene conducted at UCL IO during 2017 and 2018, treatment of retinas of Cnga3 mutant mice with AAV-CNGA3 was associated with restoration of the cone electrical response following subretinal delivery. Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the rescue of cone function that was observed in two of these studies with doses spanning those proposed in the clinical trial and in a dose dependent manner. We believe this supports the evaluation of AAV-CNGA3 to treat patients with ACHM caused by mutations in CNGA3 in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. The data from these studies have not been published. 
 Figure 5 shows the electrical response of retinas to a single flash of bright light. A retina from three different mice were tested: a normal mouse (Figure 5A), a mutant mouse lacking the Cnga3 gene (Figure 5B) and a mutant mouse lacking the Cnga3 gene, but treated with 3uL of 1E12 vg/mL AAV-CNGA3 (Figure 5C). A high degree of restoration of function of mutant cones was observed in the retina from the Cnga3 mutant mouse treated with AAV-CNGA3, with approximately 60% of the electrical response to a bright flash of light of the normal retina observed in the retina from the Cnga3 mutant mouse that were treated with AAV-CNGA3. The mice were injected with AAV-CNGA3 at four weeks of age and assessed using ERG four weeks post injection.

 Figure 6 shows the cone-mediated ERG responses measured in Cnga3 mutant mice treated with three different doses of AAV-CNGA3. 3uL of AAV-CNGA3 was administered via subretinal injection in each eye at 1E11 vg/mL (n=5), 3E11 vg/mL (n=5) and 1E12 vg/mL (n=5). The mice were treated at 15 days old and the ERG was measured four weeks after treatment. The reviewer analyzing the ERG responses was masked to which eye received treatment. Doses tested in this study span the doses of AAV-CNGA3 proposed for our Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Figure 6 shows the ERG responses that were observed at each of the three doses.

Mice were treated at 15 days post-natal and ERGs were assessed four weeks following treatment. The retinal ERGs are the electrical recordings corresponding to cone activity following a single pulse of bright light. A dose response was observed in retinal sensitivity obtained using the three tested doses and a treatment effect was also observed in the lowest dose tested. 
 In 2018, we completed a toxicology package similar to that used with the AAV-CNGB3 and AAV-RPGR programs using cGMP AAV-CNGA3 material manufactured at our cGMP facility. We conducted an approximately six-month toxicology study in mice and two, eight-week acute toxicology and biodistribution studies in mice and rabbits. 
 Clinical development of AAV-CNGA3

  (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, mobility maze and photoaversion assessments), retinal imaging (color fundus photography, fundus autofluoresence imaging, spectral domain optical coherence tomography and visual field testing) and electrophysiological assessments. The study center is the Moorfields Eye Hospital in London. We believe access to these ACHM patients will enable us to efficiently enroll appropriate patients into our CNGA3 Phase 1/2 clinical trial. In addition to giving us access to patients and potentially accelerated enrollment in our treatment study, we believe the prospective natural history data on each treated patient will allow us to gather robust data from our Phase 1/2 clinical trial in a condensed timeframe. 
 We aim to initiate a Phase 1/2 dose escalating trial of AAV-CNGA3 in ACHM patients with mutations in CNGA3. AAV-CNGA3 clinical material is currently being manufactured at our cGMP facility and we expect to release material for this trial in the first half of 2019 and open a Phase 1/2 dose escalation trial in pediatric patients shortly thereafter. 
 We will present pre-clinical data describing our AAV-CNGA3 vector optimization work in a scientific forum in the first half of 2019. 
 X-Linked Retinitis Pigmentosa 
 Disease Background and Market Opportunity 
 Retinitis pigmentosa, or RP, is a group of IRDs which represent the most common genetic cause of blindness. The condition is characterized by progressive retinal degeneration and vision loss that ends in complete blindness. There are currently no approved treatments for RP. We believe gene therapy is a promising therapeutic approach. RP initially presents as nighttime blindness during childhood or early adulthood, progressing to peripheral visual field loss and tunnel vision, central visual impairment, reduced visual acuity and, ultimately, complete blindness. 
 RP may be caused by mutations in any of over 100 different genes. The most severe forms of RP are X-linked, or XLRP, with onset in early childhood and rapid progression to blindness generally by the time patients reach 30 to 40 years old. RP has an estimated prevalence of one in 3,500 in the United States, and between 10% and 15% of RP patients are estimated to suffer from XLRP. The most frequent mutation causing XLRP is in the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator gene, or RPGR. XLRP associated with a mutation in RPGR, or XLRP-RPGR, accounts for more than 70% of cases of XLRP. There are estimated to be approximately 20,000 XLRP-RPGR patients in the United States, Japan and EU5, with a little less than 50% those patients being under the age of 40 and approximately 200 new cases being diagnosed annually. We believe the availability of a therapeutic option may increase patient identification and the estimated prevalence of XLRP-RPGR. 
 The RPGR protein has an essential role in the maintenance of the structure and function of both rod and cone photoreceptors. The RPGR protein is tightly localized in the photoreceptors at the junction of the inner and outer segments, or cilium, of the photoreceptors. Correct localization of the RPGR protein to this site is important for the transport of light sensing proteins to the outer part of the photoreceptors, where these proteins convert light signals into electrical signals. In the absence of the RPGR protein the movement of light sensing protein within both rods and cones is impaired, leading to dysfunction and death of photoreceptors, resulting in retinal degeneration and ultimately complete blindness. 
 Our Gene Therapy Program 
 Our product candidate for the treatment of XLRP, AAV-RPGR, is designed to treat XLRP caused by mutations in RPGR, the most common form of XLRP. The eye specific form of RPGR is encoded by a nucleotide sequence called RPGR open reading frame 15, or RPGR-ORF 15. Both rods and cones photoreceptors require RPGR-ORF 15 to function. The protein coding message RPGR-ORF 15 contains a region of repeated 
 
22 


  sequences that make the RPGR-ORF 15 nucleotide sequence unstable in the cell. We have engineered a small deletion in RPGR-ORF 15 that we observed was associated with a stable sequence that rescued RPGR protein levels, localization and function in mouse and human photoreceptors in preclinical studies. Our novel AAV-RPGR viral vector utilizes the human rhodopsin kinase, or RK, promoter to specifically drive the expression of our stabilized RPGR-ORF 15 in both rods and cones. We selected the AAV5 capsid because of its efficient transfection into both of these types of photoreceptors. 
 In preclinical studies, performed at UCL IO between 2009 and 2015 and discussed in Gene Therapy in 2016, it was observed that treatment with AAV-RPGR containing our stabilized RPGR-ORF15 was associated with rescue of the Rpgr mutant phenotype in mice that completely lacked the RPGR protein as measured by ERG responses of retinas from Rpgr mutant mice and assessments of RPGR protein. Restored levels, localization and function of RPGR protein in mutant mice lacking the Rpgr gene were observed, along with the restoration and localization of photosensitive proteins in both rod and cone photoreceptors, and reduction of long-term retinal degeneration. In addition to these experiments in Rpgr mutant mice, we have observed that our RPGR-ORF 15 construct also rescued levels, localization and function of RPGR protein in human photoreceptors, in HMRs derived from patients with RPGR mutations. We believe that AAV-RPGR may have the potential to positively impact human photoreceptor function and survival in XLRP-RPGR patients, slowing or halting the degeneration that leads to blindness in these patients. 
 Figure 7 and Figure 8 show data from these preclinical studies regarding the effect of subretinal delivery of AAV-RPGR containing our stabilized RPGR-ORF 15 in mice lacking the Rpgr gene. In these studies, different color stains were used to investigate the restoration of (i) RPGR protein expression, (ii) correct localization of RPGR protein and (iii) RPGR function. Figure 7 and Figure 8 show a retina from a normal mouse (7A and 8A), a retina from a mutant mouse strain lacking the gene for Rpgr (7B and 8B) and a retina from the same mutant mouse strain that lacks the gene for Rpgr, but treated with AAV-RPGR containing our stabilized RPGR-ORF 15 (7C and 8C). 
 The red stain in Figure 7 marks a photoreceptor protein, rootletin, within the cilium, or middle section, of every photoreceptor, while the green stain reveals the localization of RPGR protein. The green stain in Figure 7A shows the localization of RPGR protein within the photoreceptor at the end of the cilium in a normal mouse retina. Figure 7B shows a retina from a mouse lacking the Rpgr gene without any green staining, indicating the absence of the RPGR protein. Figure 7C shows a retina from a mouse lacking the Rpgr gene that was treated with AAV-RPGR containing our stabilized RPGR-ORF 15. The green staining at the end of the photoreceptor cilium is similar to the normal mouse retina. Treatment with AAV-RPGR containing our stabilized RPGR-ORF 15 was associated with the restoration of RPGR protein expression and localization within the individual photoreceptor cells consistent with normal RPGR expression.

 Figure 7C. The retina from a mouse completely lacking the Rpgr gene and treated with AAV-RPGR containing our stabilized RPGR-ORF 15. The green stain indicates that RPGR protein expression was restored and was similarly localized within the individual photoreceptor consistent with normal RPGR expression. 
 Figure 8 shows a different analysis of retinas from the same mutant mouse strain that completely lacks the gene for RPGR expression. This analysis uses a yellow tag to reveal the location of photoreceptor light pigment, or opsins. The top row shows the rod opsin (8A; 8B; 8C), rhodopsin, and the bottom row shows cone opsin (8A1; 8B1; 8C1). Fully functional RPGR is critical for the correct localization of opsins and Figures 8B and 8B1 show that in a Rpgr mutant mouse retina the opsins are incorrectly localized. Figures 8C and 8C1 show that treatment of these mutant animals with subretinal injection of AAV-RPGR containing our stabilized RPGR-ORF 15 enabled the correct location of the opsins within the photoreceptor as seen in the similarity to the normal mouse, indicating that RPGR is functionally active in supporting correct localization of key photoreceptor proteins.

 Figures 8C and 8C1. Rpgr mutant mouse retina that was treated with AAV-RPGR containing our stabilized RPGR-ORF 15 shows the localization of rhodopsin and opsin. The similar localization between the normal mouse retina and the Rpgr mutant mouse retina that was treated with AAV-RPGR containing our stabilized RPGR-ORF 15 indicates that the rhodopsin and opsin are correctly localized and can perform their key function in the visual cycle. 
 We are further advancing the HMR system to evaluate the potential for our product candidates to functionally restore mutant photoreceptor cells in a human retina. 
 One of the many tasks that RPGR performs in the photoreceptor is to enable a process called glutamylation of a key cilia protein called tubulin, which is required for photoreceptor function. We conducted an in vitro study at UCL IO in 2016 using HMRs derived from stem cells from XLRP-RPGR patients to determine the effect of AAV-RPGR containing our stabilized RPGR-ORF 15 on human photoreceptors. The data from this

  study has not been published. An HMR grown from hPSC from a normal individual is shown in Figure 9A, in which glutamylation of tubulin in normal human photoreceptors is stained in green. Figure 9B shows a HMR derived from a XLRP-RPGR patient and cultured over several months to form many of the anatomic layers of the retina and consisting of all photoreceptor types, while Figure 9C shows the impact of AAV-RPGR containing our stabilized RPGR-ORF 15 treatment on a similarly cultured HMR derived from a XLRP-RPGR patient. 
 The HMR derived from a XLRP-RPGR patient lacks RPGR protein, making the photoreceptors dysfunctional with no glutamylation of tubulin present (Figure 9B). When HMRs from a XLRP-RPGR patient were treated with AAV-RPGR containing our stabilized RPGR-ORF 15 we observed that glutamylation of tubulin returned (Figure 9C). We also stained HMRs derived from an XLRP-RPGR patient with a pink marker of RPGR protein. In Figure 9B no pink staining was observed, confirming the lack of RPGR protein. In Figure 9C, when the HMR from a XLRP-RPGR patient was treated with AAV-RPGR containing our stabilized RPGR-ORF 15, pink staining can be seen at the correct localization in the base of the cilium of the photoreceptors that are now stained with green glutamylation of tubulin marker. This restoration of RPGR protein expression and localization, and restoration of markers of photoreceptor function in human photoreceptors in HMRs derived from XLRP-RPGR patients, indicates potential clinical utility of AAV-RPGR containing our stabilized RPGR-ORF 15.

 To support the advancement of AAV-RPGR into clinical development, we conducted three single-dose toxicology studies from January 2016 to August 2017 at UCL IO. We performed a six-month toxicology study in normal mice delivering doses of saline in both eyes for the control (n=5), and doses of AAV-RPGR in both eyes of 2E9 vg/eye (n=5) and 4E9 vg/eye (n=5), with a toxicology assessment at one, three and six months post-administration. Two further toxicology studies were performed. An eight week mouse study in which groups of mice were dosed with saline in both eyes as a control (n=15), AAV-RPGR in both eyes at 1E9 vg/eye (n=15) or AAV-RPGR in both eyes at 4E9 vg/eye (n=15), providing five mice from each group for studying local and

  systemic effects at each time-point of one, four and eight weeks after treatment. An eight-week rabbit study was also conducted, in which nine right eyes were dosed per group, with doses of saline as a control, and AAV-RPGR doses of 0.8E11 vg/eye and 2.4E11 vg/eye, providing three rabbits for studying local and systemic effects at each time-point of one, four and eight weeks after treatment. Biodistribution was examined in the eight-week mouse and rabbit studies. No harmful effects on the retina or systemically were observed. We used these data to support our CTA and IND for treatment of XLRP-RPGR patients with AAV-RPGR.
Clinical Development of AAV-RPGR
We have an ongoing natural history study in XLRP-RPGR including approximately 100 patients, which allows us to collect structural and functional data for up to five years on prospectively defined endpoints, including functional tests (visual acuity and contrast sensitivity), retinal imaging (color fundus photography, fundus autofluoresence imaging, spectral domain optical coherence tomography, adaptive optics and visual field testing) and electrophysiological assessments. The study centers are the Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, the Kellogg Eye Center at the University of Michigan, the Medical College of Wisconsin & Froedtert Hospital and Massachusetts Eye and Ear. We believe access to this large population of XLRP-RPGR patients has enabled us to efficiently enroll appropriate patients into our XLRP-RPGR Phase 1/2 clinical trial. In addition to giving us access to patients and potentially accelerated enrollment in our treatment studies, we believe the prospective natural history data on each treated patient will potentially allow us to enroll a more heterogenous population into our treatment studies and may allow us to gather robust data from our Phase 1/2 clinical trial in a condensed timeframe. 
 RP initially presents as nighttime blindness during childhood or early adulthood, progressing to peripheral visual field loss and tunnel vision, central visual impairment, reduced visual acuity and, ultimately, complete blindness. XLRP-RPGR is a progressive disease in which the retina gradually degenerates starting in the outer, or peripheral, regions of the retina and initially causing tunnel vision with final degeneration of the central retina resulting in the complete loss of visual acuity and blindness that generally occurs by the time patients are 30 to 40 years old. We believe that to prevent this ultimate degeneration to blindness and to retain visual acuity, the central region of the retina, including the macula and fovea, must be preserved. To this end, we aim to deliver AAV-RPGR to this central region of the retina. In our Phase 1/2 clinical trial, AAV-RPGR viral vector is delivered via subretinal injection of up to 1mL with the potential for the surgeon to use multiple retinotomies targeting the region of the central retina, including the macula and fovea. One eye is treated in each patient, which is the eye assessed to be the worst eye at baseline. 
 We are conducting a Phase 1⁄2 clinical trial of AAV-RPGR in both adult and pediatric XLRP-RPGR patients. This trial is open in the United Kingdom under our CTA and in the United States under our IND. 
 We have treated ten young adult patients (aged 18 to 30 years old) in the Phase 1/2 XLRP-RPGR clinical trial. We have treated one pediatric patient in the pediatric extension arm of this trial. We expect to treat up to 40 additional patients in the extension cohorts of this study in 2019. In all patients, subretinal injection covered the central part of the retina, including the macula and fovea. 
 We expect to report preliminary safety and efficacy data from the dose escalation cohorts in the second half of 2019. 
 The FDA and EMA have granted orphan status to AAV-RPGR for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa. The FDA has also granted Fast Track designation to AAV-RPGR for the treatment of XLRP caused by defects in RPGR.

 RPE65-Deficiency 
 Disease Background and Market Opportunity 
 RPE65-deficiency causes rod photoreceptor dysfunction and impaired vision from birth. The RPE65 gene encodes a protein that is produced in the retinal pigment epithelium, or RPE, a thin layer of cells at the back of the eye that support photoreceptors and nourish the retina. The RPE65 protein is essential for rod function because it recycles the light sensing machinery in rod photoreceptors. Absence of RPE65 results in severe dysfunction of rods and causes impaired vision in dim lighting conditions. Although cone photoreceptors are generally preserved during childhood in RPE65-deficient patients, the lack of function and degeneration of the rods eventually results in the loss of cones and degeneration of the whole retina over time. Consequently, most RPE65-deficient patients experience central vision loss progressing to complete blindness by early adulthood. 
 RPE65-deficiency is often characterized as a specific subtype of Leber congenital amaurosis or RP that is caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene, called Leber congenital amaurosis 2 and RP20, respectively. However, we believe a more precise approach to genetic diseases is to focus on the underlying genetic defect, rather than the phenotype, and have therefore identified RPE65-deficiency as the target of our product candidate AAV-RPE65.
Based on an estimated prevalence of approximately one in 500,000 people in the United States suffering from Leber congenital amaurosis, or LCA, related to mutations in the RPE65 gene, and approximately one in 70,000 people in the United States having RP due to mutations in the RPE65 gene, RPE65-deficiency occurs in approximately one in 125,000 people in the United States. There are estimated to be approximately 6,000 RPE65-deficiency patients in the United States, Japan and EU5, with almost 30% of those patients being under the age of 30 and approximately 50 new cases being diagnosed annually. We believe the availability of a therapeutic option may increase patient identification and estimated prevalence of RPE65-deficiency. 
 Our Gene Therapy Program 
 Our gene therapy candidate for the treatment of RPE65-deficiency, AAV-RPE65, is an AAV2/5 viral vector, in which a codon optimized RPE65 gene is driven by a novel synthetic RPE cell specific promoter. 
 RPE65-deficiency is a well validated condition for gene replacement therapy. In multiple clinical trials, including one conducted by our collaborators at UCL, replacing the mutant RPE65 gene with a normal copy of the gene resulted in improved nighttime vision in affected children and young adults, suggesting the potential impact of gene therapy on rod function in this disease. The FDA recently approved the first gene treatment for RPE65-deficiency, Luxturna. While RPE65-deficiency primarily causes a loss of rod function initially leading to impaired vision in dim light, these patients ultimately experience complete blindness because of degeneration of the cone rich fovea. To prevent blindness, therefore, we believe it is critical to treat the central retina in order to maintain structural integrity in this region and save central vision. We aim to treat as extensive an area of the central retina as possible, including the cone rich fovea. Thus, in addition to improving rod function, we aim to provide sufficient RPE65 protein to the cells in the central retina to prevent the degeneration of both rods and cones in this region, and thereby prevent the progression to complete blindness. 
 We focus on detailed structural and functional data in our treatment studies with the aim of demonstrating an impact on the degeneration of the central retina. 
 Our novel AAV2/5 vector, AAV-RPE65, has been optimized for both transduction of RPE cells and RPE65 protein production and our surgical approach targets the central area of retina whose preservation is most critical for long term maintenance of visual function. Building on the work of Professor Ali and in collaboration with the team at UCL, we have developed AAV-RPE65. AAV-RPE65 is a second generation viral vector that has compared favorably to our first generation AAV2/2 vector in a number of ways, including being two to three logs, or 100 to 1,000 times, more potent on a particle for particle basis than our original AAV2/2 vector in a head 
 
27 


  to head Rpe65 null animal model rescue experiment. On a logarithmic scale, each log represents a 10-fold change. We believe this increased potency will improve transgene expression and RPE65 protein production in the back of the eye. The table below summarizes elements of the optimization of AAV-RPE65 compared to our original AAV2/2 vector. Vector optimization studies were performed at UCL IO and were carried out from 2010 to 2015. The data summarized here was referred to in Gene Therapy in 2016. We used these data to support our IND and CTA for treatment of RPE65-deficient patients with AAV-RPE65.


Optimization of AAV2/5 compared to AAV2/2
Transfection Efficiency | Changing the capsid from AAV2/2 to AAV2/5 was associated with an improvement of the transfection efficiency of RPE by four times. 
Protein Expression (Promoter) | AAV2/5s optimized promoter was associated with a 20 times increase in protein expression. 
Protein Expression (Codon) | AAV2/5s optimized codon usage was associated with a seven times increase in protein expression in human cells. 
mRNA Stability | Utilizing SV40 intron increases mRNA stability and was associated with a two and one half times increase in protein production. 
Overall Efficacy | The optimized construct was associated with a 300 to 1,000 times increase in efficacy in mouse functional rescue and is expected to be two to three logs more potent on a particle for particle basis in humans.

 We conducted four single-dose toxicology and biodistribution studies of AAV-RPE65 from January 2015 to December 2016. We performed a long-term toxicology study in normal mice in which four eyes were dosed with saline as a control and nine eyes were dosed with AAV-RPE65 at 4E9 vg/eye, with a toxicology assessment at one, three, six and nine months post-administration. We also conducted an eight-week mouse study, an eight-week rabbit study and an eight-week minipig study. In the mouse study, 15 mice were dosed in both eyes with saline as a control, 15 mice were dosed in both eyes with AAV-RPE65 at 1.2E9 vg/eye and 15 mice were dosed in both eyes with AAV-RPE65 at 3.7E9 vg/eye, providing five mice from each group for studying local and systemic effects at each time-point of one, four and eight weeks after treatment. In the rabbit study, nine rabbits right eyes were dosed for each group with a saline control group, a 0.6E11 vg/eye group and a 1.9E11 vg/eye group, providing three animals from each group for studying local and systemic effects at each time-point of one, four and eight weeks after treatment. The minipig study was a two-week single dose injection study in minipigs (n=2, each dosed in one eye) at a dose of 1.84E1011 vg/eye. The minipig study was performed by Charles River Laboratories, while the other three studies were performed at UCL IO. No harmful effects on the retina were observed during these studies. We used these data in support of our CTA and IND for treatment of RPE65-deficient patients with AAV-RPE65.
Clinical development of AAV-RPE65
We have an ongoing natural history study in patients with RPE65-deficiency with approximately 30 patients enrolled that allows us to collect structural and functional data on prospectively defined endpoints, including functional tests (mobility maze, color vision, visual acuity and quality of life measures), retinal imaging (color fundus photography, fundus autofluoresence imaging, visual field testing, spectral domain optical coherence tomography and adaptive optics) and electrophysiological assessments. The study is global, with study centers including at the Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center and the Medical College of Wisconsin & Froedtert Hospital. We plan to present this natural history data to regulatory agencies in our meetings following completion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial for discussion of our pivotal trial design and path to regulatory approval. 
 This clinical trial enrolled patients in the United Kingdom under our CTA, as well as the United States under our IND. Dosing in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial was completed June of 2018. The primary endpoint of this 
 
28 


  open-label, dose-escalation clinical trial is the safety of delivering AAV-RPE65 through subretinal injection in patients with RPE65-deficiency. Secondary endpoints include the outcomes of a range of functional tests, detailed structural analysis of the retina and quality of life measures. A total of 15 patients were treated in this clinical trial, including nine adult patients in three dose escalating cohorts and six pediatric patients in the pediatric extension arm of the trial. Surgeries in this trial have been carried out in the United States at the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center and in the United Kingdom at the Moorfields Eye Hospital by three different surgeons. No differences in outcomes have been observed between the different surgeons. 
 In cohort one, three adults (aged 19, 20 and 20 years old) were administered up to 1mL of 1E11 vg/mL of AAV-RPE65 vector. In each patient, the central region of the retina was targeted. No serious adverse events or dose limiting events have been reported in this cohort as of the 18-month time point following vector administration. 
 In each patient treated in cohort one, we observed improvement or stability in central visual function following treatment compared to baseline and compared to the untreated fellow eye. Retinal sensitivity was measured with threshold static perimetry using Octopus 900 perimetry and visual field modelling and analysis, or VFMA. Observations at 18 months following vector administration in the first cohort have demonstrated a potential increase in retinal sensitivity by up to 40% from baseline. In contrast, we observed that the untreated eyes of patients in this cohort suffered a reduction in retinal sensitivity of up to 40%, which is in consistent with data from our parallel prospective natural history study of RPE65-deficient patients. In addition to the perimetry and VFMA data, improvements in time and error rate in mobility maze navigation have been observed in these patients at six and 12 months following treatment. However, this is preliminary data and needs to be supported by data collected at later time-points and in larger numbers of patients. 
 In addition to the functional data discussed above, we are collecting detailed structural data on all patients in our Phase 1/2 clinical trial. This includes data to visualize the mosaic of individual cones in the central part of the retina over time in each patient. As of May 4, 2018, we had sequential cone map data for more than 18 months following subretinal injections that covered the macula and fovea in the patients in cohort one and we had not observed retinal thinning or loss of cones over time following treatment. We are continuing to monitor the detailed structure of both treated and untreated fellow eye in the five-year follow on study to assess if AAV-RPE65 treatment has an impact on degeneration in the treated area of the eye compared to the untreated fellow eye. 
 In cohort two, three adults (aged 16, 20 and 22) were administered vector peripherally via subretinal injection into the outer region of the retina at a higher dose of up to 1mL of 3E11 vg/mL. Following completion of the four-week steroid taper, in two patients inflammatory responses were noted by the investigator as being probably related to vector administration. Both responded to a further course of steroids. Improvements in visual mobility in study eye over non-study eye were observed at 12 months at the four lux lighting level in this cohort. Similar increases in retinal sensitivity to cohort one have not been observed at this dose level. We believe data from cohort two is suggestive that peripheral administration of the vector into more degenerating areas of the retina may result in an increased chance of an immune response with a decreased potential benefit compared central administration of the vector. Following the review of the safety data for each adult cohort treated in this study, the IDMC recommended escalation to the higher dose in the next cohort. 
 Based on the safety and activity data from the patients treated at the 1E11 vg/mL dose level (cohort one), the decision was made to treat pediatric patients at this dose prior to receiving the full safety data from adult cohort three, and to target the central part of the retina in all pediatric patients. Treatment of pediatric patients in the United Kingdom and United States has been completed and six pediatric patients have been treated. 
 We carry out detailed assessments of retinal sensitivity across the entire retina, with the majority of tested retinal locations covering the central retina, at baseline and at prospectively defined time-points following 
 
29 


  treatment using the Octopus 900 perimeter. The Octopus 900 perimeter, unlike other standard clinical devices, enables full-field static perimetry using testing algorithms specifically designed for retinal conditions, affords the use of custom-developed testing grids, and allows the full dataset to be extracted and modelled for more accurate measurement of change over time. 
 Discreet small spots of light are shone onto multiple predetermined points (the test grid) covering the central retinal field and peripheral retina, with the patient responding each time they perceive a spot of light. Each point on the retina is tested multiple times with different intensities of light, thereby allowing the determination of both the reliability and reproducibility of the patients response to each light level at each spot and an accurate measurement of the exact retinal sensitivity at topographically determined points. The data is read out as a heat map of sensitivity across the retinal field. The reliability of the patient and the data produced is also calculated and provided by the machine. In addition to the heat map of retinal sensitivity and conventional mean sensitivity metric produced by Octopus 900 assessment, we also conduct advanced VFMA. This produces a volumetric measure of retinal sensitivity presented both numerically as well as in a topographical retinal sensitivity map, which better represents the entire dataset across the visual field. We compare the VFMA data from the retinal map at each timepoint following treatment to the baseline data to measure the extent and position of changes in retinal sensitivity over time in treated and untreated eyes. 
 We completed dosing of the final pediatric patients in June of 2018, and we closed out the study six months after the last pediatric patient was treated. Patients will then move into a long term follow up study in which patients will be followed for safety and an indication of benefit for an additional four and a half years. 
 We expect to report topline six-month follow up safety and efficacy data in the first half of 2019, with full data expected to be presented in a scientific forum in the second half of 2019. 
 The FDA and EMA each granted orphan status to AAV-RPE65 for the treatment of LCA caused by mutations in RPE65. The FDA also granted AAV-RPE65 rare pediatric disease designation for the treatment of inherited retinal dystrophy due to biallelic RPE65 mutations. 
 LCA4 
 Disease Background 
 LCA4 is an IRD that causes complete blindness before age five. AIPL1 is a central protein for the maintenance of photoreceptor structure and function. Deletion of the AIPL1 gene causes the most severe form of early retinal dystrophy, LCA4, in which the retinal structure is destroyed with complete vision loss. LCA4 is rare, representing approximately 8% of all LCA cases. 
 There are currently no approved treatments for LCA4, and we believe an effective intervention will require introducing a normal functional copy of the AIPL1 gene into rod and cone photoreceptors early in a patients life while some retinal structure remains in order to activate function and survival of the photoreceptors that are still present. We believe gene therapy has the potential to be the only effective way to address the diseases root cause. 
 Our Gene Therapy Program 
 LCA4s extremely rapid progression, rarity and early age of onset make the standard process of seeking regulatory approval through clinical development challenging because adult safety trials would not yield meaningful data given the early onset of the disease. We believe we are well placed to initiate the first clinical intervention in this indication through our relationships with UCL and Moorfields Eye Hospital, whose expertise and large IRD patient population enables such an aggressive and uncommon IRD to be treated. 
 To address LCA4, we developed a viral vector to replace the AIPL1 gene in all photoreceptors by using the AIPL1 cDNA driven by the rhodopsin kinase promoter, which is active in both rods and cones. 
 
30 


 Much of the preclinical work to support the proof of concept for gene therapy in LCA4 was conducted by our collaborators at UCL IO, led by Professor Robin Ali, and was published in Gene Therapy in 2010. 
 Figure 10 and Figure 11 show histological sections revealing the structure of retinas from Aipl1 mutant mice treated with AAV-AIPL1, compared to untreated retinas from Aipl1 mutant mice, at six months and 23 months after treatment. 
 It was observed at both time-points that Aipl1 mutant mice treated with AAV-AIPL1 suffered less photoreceptor loss than untreated Aipl1 mutant mice, with the retinas of untreated mutant mice almost completely degenerated by 24 months of age. Aipl1 mutant mice were treated with.5uL of AAV-AIPL1 at 1E12 at four weeks post-natal and eyes were sectioned at six months and 23 months after treatment. These treated retinas were compared to retinas from untreated control Aipl1 mice (n=17 eyes), and retinas from normal mice without the Aipl1 mutation sectioned at the same post-natal ages as the treated Aipl mutant mice. The data indicates that subretinal administration of AAV-AIPL1 is associated with the protection of the retina from degradation that occurs in Aipl1 mutant mice, and this effect was durable out to two years, the oldest age studied in these mice.

 Clinical material was manufactured to cGMP standards under a specials license. Some of this clinical material was used in studies in 2017 at UCL to confirm potency in an AIPL1 deficient mouse and to perform toxicology testing in normal mice and rabbits. A potency study was conducted at a AAV-AIPL1 dose of 3E9 vg/eye with a group size of three eyes. Assessments were performed at three weeks and supported the potency of the cGMP clinical material through analysis of the ERG response. 
 A toxicology study was performed with normal mice and rabbits. In the mouse portion, five animals per group were evaluated for local and systemic effects at four weeks. In the rabbit portion, three animals per group were evaluated for local and systemic effects at four and eight weeks. Safety evaluation included functional assessments using ERG, fundoscopy, and structural assessments. 
 Our product candidate, AAV-AIPL1, was manufactured and released for compassionate use under a specials license in the UK to treat LCA4 patients at the Moorfields Eye Hospital. This allows physicians at the Moorfields Eye Hospital to prescribe a treatment of AAV-AIPL1 for LCA4 patients they deem appropriate. We play no role in the physicians treatment decision. We intend to use the data produced by the compassionate use treatment to inform any potential clinical development plan as well as any interactions with the regulatory agencies that would enable us to make this intervention more widely available to the LCA4 patient population. Although patients have been reviewed at the Moorfields Eye Hospital, so far none have been treated with AAV-AIPL1. As the manufacturer of AAV-AIPL1 under a specials license, we have a record retention requirement and a continuing obligation to inform the MHRA of any suspected adverse reaction to our medicinal product which is a serious adverse reaction. 
 The UKs Human Medicines Regulations 2012 allow for the manufacture and supply of medicinal products not authorized for marketing to patients with special needs at the request of the healthcare professional responsible for the patients care (these products are referred to as specials). A special may only be supplied in: (i) response to an unsolicited order from a healthcare professional responsible for the care of the patient, (ii) if the product is manufactured and assembled in accordance with the specifications of that healthcare professional to fulfil the special needs of the individual patient that cannot be met by products already authorized for marketing and (iii) if the product is manufactured under a specials license granted by the UKs Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA. 
 Manufacturing a special also imposes a five year record retention requirements subject to review by the MHRA, including details of any suspected adverse reaction to the product so sold or supplied of which the person is aware or subsequently becomes aware, as well as a continuing obligation to notify the MHRA of any suspected adverse reaction to the medicinal product which is a serious adverse reaction. 
 The FDA and EMA granted orphan designation to our product candidate, AAV-AIPL1, for treatment of inherited retina dystrophy due to defects in AIPL1 gene. 
 Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) 
 Disease Background and Market Opportunity 
 AMD is a chronic eye condition that causes gradual decline of central vision. It is the leading cause of vision loss in individuals more than fifty years old in the United States and it affects 6.2 million people globally. Although AMD does not usually lead to complete blindness because peripheral vision is generally maintained, losing central vision has a critical impact on visual acuity, which is achieved by the closely packed cones of the central retina. As a result, loss of central retinal function has a significant impact on a persons independence and quality of life. 
 
32 


 AMD is a complex disease attributed to several different causes. A number of genetic and environmental risk factors have been associated with the development of AMD. Two late forms of AMD have been characterized: geographic atrophy, or dry AMD, and neovascular AMD, or wet AMD. Dry AMD is characterized by the progressive, irreversible loss of many of the cell types in the retina, including the RPE, photoreceptors, and underlying capillaries of the macula, and causes a decline in central visual function. Wet AMD is defined by the growth and invasion of immature blood vessels from the underlying choroid into the retina. Leakage from these fragile blood vessels causes build-up of blood and fluid under the retina, leading to detachment of the RPE or retina and long-term scarring. 
 Current therapeutic options for AMD are limited. There is no approved therapy that impacts the disease progression of dry AMD. The best available treatment for patients after they lose central vision and acuity is support and rehabilitation services to help them better utilize the remaining peripheral part of their retina. 
 Effective treatments for wet AMD are focused on blocking blood vessel growth, or angiogeneisis, that underlies the pathology of the disease. These wet AMD treatments specifically block the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, one of the key drivers of angiogenesis. There are two approved anti-VEGF treatments on the market, ranibizumab, or Lucentis, and aflibercept, or Eyelea. These may be effective in some wet AMD patients, but require challenging dosing regimens that typically include intra-ocular injections every one to three months. 
 Our Gene Therapy Programs 
 Wet AMD 
 We aim to use a gene-based strategy to deliver an anti-angiogenic molecule to the retina and create a local factory that will deliver a continual supply of antiangiogenic molecules to the key parts of the eye. This would require a one-time injection procedure to deliver the gene therapy to the affected eye. We focus our blockade on the receptor involved in driving aberrant blood vessel growth and leakage, VEGF Receptor 2, or VEGFR2. Rather than depleting the VEGF ligand from the system we aim to block the receptor for that ligand preventing VEGF binding to the receptor and thereby preventing downstream pathology of wet AMD that is normally triggered by VEGF binding to VEGFR2. We use an anti-VEGFR2 antibody. In some rodent models the inhibition of the VEGFR2 with this antibody appears to have reduced long term toxicity as compared to the depletion of the VEGF ligand. Initial studies have identified a lead candidate that we have now moved from the research stage to formal preclinical development. We are also working to integrate our gene regulation technology with our wet AMD program. Our ultimate aim is to activate the anti-VEGFR2 antibody gene that we have installed in the eye with a small molecule applied topically with an eye drop. This could potentially allow for intermittent dosing of the antibody using an eye drop rather than an injection. 
 Dry AMDRod to Cone Program 
 To treat dry AMD, and specifically to treat patients with geographic atrophy in which the central part of the retina is irreversibly damaged, we are advancing a novel strategy to alter the very character of rod photoreceptors. 
 In advanced forms of dry AMD, central visual function is lost after the fovea and the larger central retina area has degenerated, and any residual vision is generally via the outer retinas rods. A critical characteristic of cones that allows for response to high light levels is that they recover rapidly after they are stimulated by light. In contrast to cones, rods work in low light levels and require longer exposure to trigger an impulse and are then much slower to recover to a state when they can respond again. Therefore, seeing via rods is slow and imprecise, whereas cones mediate acute high-resolution vision. By genetically engineering rods with molecules that will improve their speed of recovery and response to light, we aim to effectively transform a patch of rod photoreceptors to behave more like cones. This rod-to-cone transformation would potentially be achieved 
 
33 


  by using localized gene therapy vector placement in the rod-rich peripheral retina to create a small patch or pseudo fovea, where cone like behavior of rods would enable the patients brain to fixate on a functional part of the peripheral retina and recover a more cone like response to higher light levels. 
 The proof of concept has already been achieved in animal models, with first generation molecules designed to speed up the visual cycle recovery times in rods. We will continue to develop and optimize these molecules using our screening systems to allow selection for sensitivity to natural high light intensities and for the high refresh rate required. 
 Xerostomia 
 Disease Background and Market OpportunityRIX 
 Radiation induced xerostomia, or RIX, is a severe and debilitating long-term side effect of radiation treatment for head and neck cancer. There is not currently any FDA approved treatment for RIX. Worldwide, there are approximately 500,000 new cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed each year, with approximately 50,000 cases in the United States alone, making it the fifth most common malignancy. Approximately 85% of patients who receive radiation treatment for head and neck cancer experience reduced saliva production during treatment, and approximately 40% of those patients who remain cancer free for two or more years after treatment continue to suffer from grade 2 or 3 RIX. There are approximately 170,000 such patients in the United States, with approximately 10,000 new cases each year. Severity of RIX is measured from grade 1 (mildest) to 4 (most severe). As these patients tend to be under the care of a physician and dentist and have access to some form of health insurance, we believe this is an accessible indication with much larger commercial potential than some genetic diseases that are currently targets of our gene therapy programs. 
 RIX is a frequent side effect of head and neck cancer treatment because the standard treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancer involves radiotherapy, which can cause irreversible damage to non-diseased tissues located near oral tumors, such as the salivary glands. The fluid secreting, or acinar cells, of the salivary glands are uniquely sensitive to radiation, are destroyed acutely on IR exposure and to a large extent do not regenerate, resulting in chronically reduced salivary output. Because saliva plays such a critical role in the physiology and protection of upper gastrointestinal, or GI, tract tissues, patients with chronic RIX suffer severe long-term complications of head and neck irradiation that has a significant impact on the patients daily living. Chronic RIX results in severe side effects, including difficulty swallowing, or dysphagia, oral discomfort, malnutrition, oral mucositis, changes in taste, increased oral infections and dental cavities. 
Our Gene Therapy ProgramRIX 
 Salivary glands are an attractive target organ for gene therapy treatments because they are self-contained, partially immune protected and easily accessible, allowing for non-invasive delivery of small vector doses. 
 We are developing AAV-AQP1 to treat RIX by increasing water conduction in the chronically damaged salivary glands by introducing a water conducting channel into the remaining epithelial cells of these damaged glands. Adequate water secretion by surviving epithelial cells has the potential to deliver the protective exocrine proteins produced by remaining gland cells into the mouth. 
 The key to our approach is that, unlike the water conducting acinar cells, the water impermeable duct cells of the glands appear to be resilient to IR exposure. As a consequence of this relative resilience to radiation treatment, salivary glands damaged by radiation treatment tend to contain mostly water impermeable ductal epithelial cells. To make these duct cells permeable to water, AAV-AQP1 introduces the gene for the human aquaporin water channel, or hAQP1. We have demonstrated that this has the potential to convey water permeability and causes ductal cells to generate an osmotic gradient, which causes them to secrete fluid into the lumen of the duct.

 The proof of concept for this mechanism and its ability to increase the volume of saliva secreted by damaged salivary glands was observed in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial conducted by the NIH in patients with chronic grade 2 or 3 RIX. The trial was designed as a short-term dose escalation trial of doses of AAV-AQP1 between 4.8E7 and 5.8E9 pu/gland using adenovirus as the vector to deliver the hAQP1 to the remaining epithelial cells in the parotid gland of 11 patients suffering from chronic RIX. There were no reported severe adverse events among the patients treated, two out of three patients in each of the first three cohorts in this clinical trial were observed to have objective increases in saliva volume produced by the treated parotid gland, with increases in parotid flow ranging from 60% to 540%, and all but one of these patients showed a decrease in symptoms of dry mouth as measured by subjective visual analog scales, validated in other forms of xerostomia. The results of this study were published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2012. 
 We are currently conducting a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial in patients with grade 2 or 3 RIX who remain cancer free for at least five years after receiving radiation treatment. In this trial we are using AAV2 to deliver the hAQP1 gene, as we believe AAV2 efficiently transfects the salivary gland cells and does not spread beyond the target cells. Up to 18 adult patients may be administered doses of AAV-AQP1 between 3E9 and 6E11 viral particles per gland in dose escalation cohorts of three patients each. The aim of the trial is to determine the safety of inserting hAQP1 locally into the salivary glands of RIX patients, as well as to measure changes in salivary flow resulting from the introduction of this channel. We have completed dosing in the first cohort and second cohort, having treated six patients. This clinical trial is being conducted in conjunction with the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research at the NIH Dental Clinic. 
 We expect to initiate an additional clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and up to five additional clinical sites in the United States in 2019. 
 The FDA granted orphan drug designation for AAV-AQP1 to treat symptoms of grade 2 and grade 3 late xerostomia from parotid gland hypofunction caused by radiotherapy for cancer of the oral cavity. 
 Sjogrens Syndrome 
 The destruction of salivary tissue resulting in chronic xerostomia may also be caused by chronic autoimmune disease. Sjogrens syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which a patients immune system may target the salivary glands. Chronic inflammation of the salivary glands results in long term damage and chronic xerostomia in many Sjogrens patients. Data from preclinical studies in animal models of Sjogrens syndrome and data from explants of minor salivary glands of Sjogrens patients suggest that Sjogrens syndrome may also be treatable with our AAV-AQP1 vector. Supported by data from our preclinical studies and our ongoing RIX clinical trials, we are currently conducting IND-enabling studies of AAV-AQP1 for xerostomia caused by Sjogrens syndrome. 
 Neurodegenerative Diseases 
 We also have clinical stage, research and preclinical programs targeting neurodegenerative diseases, with a clinical program in Parkinsons disease and a research focus in ALS and Alzheimers disease. In ALS and Alzheimers disease, we aim to target what we believe is a central factor in the underlying cell biology of the diseases - RNA metabolism in ALS and endosomal trafficking dysfunction in Alzheimers disease. Relying on our expertise in viral vector design, delivery, production and manufacturing, we are aiming to develop and optimize vectors to effectively treat both genetic and sporadic forms of these diseases. 
Parkinsons Disease 
 Disease Background and Market Opportunity 
 Affecting nearly one million Americans and 10 million worldwide, Parkinsons disease is the second-most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimers disease and is the 14th-leading cause of death in the 
 
35 


  United States. It is associated with a progressive loss of motor control (e.g., shaking or tremor at rest and lack of facial expression), as well as non-motor symptoms (e.g., depression and anxiety). There is no cure for Parkinsons disease and 60,000 new cases are diagnosed each year in the United States alone. 
 Our Gene Therapy Approach 
 AAV-GAD is an investigational gene therapy product candidate designed to deliver the glutamic acid decarboxylase, or GAD, gene to the subthalamic nucleus in order to increase production of GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain. GAD is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of GABA, therefore it is believed that increasing subthalamic nucleus GAD expression through gene therapy has the potential to result in normalization of motor circuits and improve symptoms in Parkinsons disease patients without affecting other brain regions, which can be responsible for complications of existing therapies. 
 AAV-GAD Clinical Results 
 In a blinded Phase 2 clinical trial of AAV-GAD in patients with medically refractory Parkinsons disease, 45 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either AAV-GAD gene therapy delivered by injection into the subthalamic nucleus on both sides of the brain or bilateral sham surgery. Subjects were followed for one year and all results remained blinded until the final treated patient reached the 6-month primary endpoint. The trial met the primary endpoint, with a significant improvement in the off-medication motor section of the Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale, or UPDRS, part 3 observed in treated patients compared to baseline. There was also a significant difference in the degree of improvement observed compared with patients in the sham arm. The primary outcome measure was the six-month change from baseline in double-blind assessment of off-medication UPDRS motor scores. At the six-month endpoint, UPDRS score for the AAV-GAD group decreased by 8.1 points (SD 1.7, 23.1%; p<0.0001) and by 4.7 points in the sham group (1.5, 12.7%; p=0.003). The AAV-GAD group showed a significantly greater improvement from baseline in UPDRS scores compared with the sham group over the six-month course of the study (RMANOVA, p=0.04). Significant difference in the response rate between groups were observed, with responders being defined as patients achieving a 9-point or more improvement in UPDRS, which may be deemed clinically meaningful. At six months, 50% of AAV-GAD treated patients were responders compared with only 14% of patients in the sham arm. At 12 months, response rates were 63% and 24%, in AAV-GAD and sham arms, respectively. An improvement in complications of medical therapy as measured by the UPDRS part 4 was observed in the AAV-GAD group at both six and 12 months. A significant decline in duration of disabling dyskinesia was observed only in the AAV-GAD treated patients. 
 AAV-GAD was reported to be well-tolerated, with no significant adverse events related to the therapy and no speech or cognitive complications observed. The most commonly reported adverse events were transient mild or moderate headache (seven in treated arm vs. two in sham arm), nausea (six in treated arm vs. two in sham arm) and worsening of Parkinsons disease (zero in treated arm vs. four in sham arm). The results of the trial were published in the March 2011 issue of The Lancet Neurology, the August 2014 issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation and the April 2017 issue of JCI Insight, building upon publications of the Phase 1 trial data in The Lancet and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In addition, in research published in the November 28, 2018 issue of Science Translational Medicine, fifteen patients treated with AAV-GAD gene therapy were observed to have expressed a treatment-related reorganization of functional brain connectivity that was related to disease symptom improvement. This flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography analyses provided objective biological evidence of improvements in abnormal brain networks associated with Parkinsons disease following AAV-GAD gene therapy. 
 These results were observed in patients treated in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. Blinded analyses showed significant improvements in abnormal thalamic metabolism, a key node in the movement circuitry, in the AAV-GAD treated patients. This pattern of brain network activity was not seen in untreated hemispheres or patients in the sham arm. Furthermore, a specific pattern of brain network activity was identified in those 
 
36 


  subjects with clinical improvements in the sham arm, which was different from the pattern observed in AAV-GAD responders. 
 ALS 
 Disease Background and Market Opportunity 
 ALS is a devastating, progressive, neurodegenerative disease leading to the loss of motor neurons, which are the neurons that control the ability to move, speak, swallow and ultimately to breathe. The gradual paralysis in ALS invariably leads to death. While 10% of ALS cases are caused by inherited genetic mutations, most ALS occurs sporadically, with no known genetic cause. Mutations in over 20 genes have been identified that cause the inherited ALS cases. Characterization of these disease-causing genes have implicated several cellular pathways in the disease, with a prominent role emerging for genes involved in the cellular control of RNA. Many new regulatory roles are being discovered for RNA, particularly in neurons. 
 One gene linked to ALS is the transactive response DNA-binding protein 43, or TDP-43. The TDP-43 protein is one of a number of proteins that binds to cellular RNA and regulates its function and stability. When TDP-43 does not function normally, RNA regulation in the neurons loses its tight control and the motor neurons die. While mutations in TDP-43 account for only about 0.5% of ALS cases, aggregates of TDP-43 protein are observed in motor neurons of more than 95% of all ALS patients, including both inherited and sporadic, and TDP-43 aggregation is a central feature of diseased motor neurons in ALS patients. TDP-43, therefore, may be a critical therapeutic target for the treatment of both sporadic and inherited forms of ALS. TDP-43 aggregates are also seen in approximately 50% of patients with frontotemporal dementia, or FTD, suggesting a potentially similar underlying mechanism of this neurodegenerative disease. 
 Our Gene Therapy Approach 
 Genetic approaches using yeast as the primary model system have been used to identify ways of protecting motor neurons from death in ALS. A genetic screen was conducted to look for activated genes that rescue the toxicity of TDP-43 aggregation. A group of fives genes that reduce TDP-43 toxicity, was identified including members of the nonsense mediated decay, or NMD, machinery, and two genes in particular: up frameshift protein 1, or UPF1, and up frameshift protein 2, or UPF2. 
 NMD is the quality control system regulating RNA processing and activity in all cells, and has additional and broader functions specifically in regulating RNA in neurons. 
 Over the past decade, increasing evidence suggests that motor neurons may be particularly vulnerable to defects in RNA regulation, which may be caused by a number of defects, including TDP-43 aggregation. We believe that increasing the master quality control machinery for RNA processing, NMD, in motor neurons may improve the ability of motor neurons to survive in ALS. 
 We have designed a viral vector product candidate, AAV-UPF1, with the aim of increasing UPF1 expression in the motor neurons of ALS patients. In preclinical studies, we observed that administration of AAV-UPF1 reduced motor neuron death thought to be driven by the toxic effects of several different genetic causes of ALS including, TDP-43, FUS and C9orf72. Improvements in ALS-like symptoms related to limb strength and mobility in rodent models of ALS have also been observed following administration of AAV-UPF1.
We believe that gene therapy using AAV-UPF1 may increase UPF1 levels in cells affected by ALS, and we intend to deliver our viral vector product candidate to the central nervous system via intrathecal injection, or injection into the spinal canal. We are currently conducting IND enabling studies in animal models and have observed the preservation of neurons and a positive impact on functional endpoints in Fus and TDP-43 neuronal cell cultures. Based on data from our non-human primate studies conducted in 2018, we have identified a 
 
37 


  proprietary capsid for use in our AAV-UPF1 vector. We anticipate completing pre-IND activity in 2019 and aim to file an IND in the second half of 2019. We expect that AAV-UPF1 clinical material for the Phase 1/2 clinical trial will be manufactured at our cGMP manufacturing facility. 
 Alzheimers Disease 
 Disease Background and Market Opportunity 
 With the world population aging, Alzheimers disease has emerged as an extremely common and costly disease. While some treatments that have temporary effects on Alzheimers disease symptoms are available, there is currently no approved treatment that halts the progression of the disease. Two biological pathways have been identified that are considered causes of Alzheimers disease. They are identified as causative because mutations in genes that affect these pathways alone cause patients to develop the disease. The first causative pathway, identified in rare forms of early onset Alzheimers disease, is the misprocessing of amyloid precursor protein, or APP, caused by genetic defects in APP itself and the APP processing proteins presenilin 1 and 2. The second causative pathway is related to the correct movement, or trafficking, of cellular protein which is controlled by a cell component called the endosome. Loss of function mutations in the endosomal protein sortilin-related receptor 1, or SORL1, have recently been shown to cause Alzheimers disease. 
 The endosome is an organelle within the cell that is responsible for correctly directing protein trafficking to different sites within the cell as well as to the cell surface. In neurons, there is significant protein trafficking, particularly at dendrites or neuronal connections where the endosomal trafficking system regulates the movement of the cell signaling machinery that allows neurons to communicate with one another. 
 The molecular machine that drives endosomal protein trafficking is made up of a complex of proteins together called the retromer. The protein encoded by the Alzheimers disease causing gene SORL1 is a retromer component. SORL1 and other components of the retromer complex are commonly deficient in Alzheimers disease patients brains. Defects in the endosomal trafficking pathway have also been implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinsons disease, ALS and frontotemporal dementia. 
 Our Gene Therapy Approach 
 Our Alzheimers disease program focuses on the endosomal trafficking pathway. In preclinical studies, we observed that increasing levels of key retromer proteins may reverse endosomal trafficking defects. We are identifying suitable retromer targets for gene augmentation in pre-symptomatic Alzheimers patients. 
 There are several reasons why gene therapy is, in principle, well suited for Alzheimers disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The first relates to the pathophysiology, time course, and anatomical spread of these disorders. Neurodegenerative diseases generally begin locally in selectively vulnerable regions with cell sickness years before rampant cell death and wide-spread anatomical distribution. To be most effective, we believe interventions should be administrated early and will benefit from local delivery. Even then, however, an intervention must maintain its efficacy for years because, unlike other cells in the body, neurons do not typically divide over the course of their life. We believe AAV-delivered gene therapy products may have a durable effect. In the best case scenario, one delivery successfully taken up by targeted neurons would be sufficient for years of efficacy. 
 An important component of our approach is the development and validation of surrogate markers of endosomal dysfunction and predictive markers of Alzheimers disease. In particular, several well studied biomarkers linked to Alzheimers disease, such as amyloid-beta and tau, have also been shown to be biomarkers of endosomal trafficking dysfunction in neurons. Such biomarkers could potentially be used to identify patients with Alzheimers disease, as well as demonstrate potential product efficacy in the absence of Alzheimers disease symptoms. By targeting endosomal trafficking dysregulation we aim to address the underlying cause of Alzheimers disease as well as other neurodegenerative diseases, such as certain forms of Parkinsons disease.

 Our Gene Regulation Platform 
 We are developing a potentially transformative technology designed to enable us to use small molecules to turn gene therapy product candidates on and off. The aim of this gene regulation platform is to transform gene therapy into a generalizable mechanism for the delivery of biologic drugs. The idea is that the gene encoding a particular biologic drug, for example epoetin alfa, or a therapeutic antibody, would be delivered to target cells in the body, but these genes would only be activated in the presence of a specific small molecule. The therapeutic protein would be manufactured by the body only in the presence of the small molecule so that intermittent production of the therapeutic protein would be achieved by dosing with the small molecule drug. 
 This temporal regulation of gene therapy products by exogenous small molecules has long been a goal of gene therapy researchers. The ability to regulate transgenes by introducing temporal control has the potential to transform the gene therapy landscape and the biologics industry as a whole. Our approach focuses on riboswitches to regulate gene expression rather than on the modulation of transcription factor activity, and this is the basis of our gene regulation platform. 
 Riboswitches are pieces of RNA that fold into alternative shapes depending on the binding of a specific small molecule to that RNA sequence. One RNA shape allows the gene containing the riboswitch to be active, while the alternative shape inactivates the gene. Riboswitches are used extensively by bacteria, but none have been identified in mammalian cells to date. 
 We designed de-novo mammalian riboswitches that we have observed respond to small molecules to switch genes on and off in mammalian cells and in vivo in mice. Our riboswitch contains a stretch of RNA sequence, called an aptamer, that binds to a specific small molecule. The riboswitch is inserted into the therapeutic transgene cDNA. In the absence of the specific small molecule, the unbound riboswitch folds into the shape that drives the destruction of the RNA message and no therapeutic protein is produced in the absence of the small molecule. However, when the small molecule is present and binds to the riboswitch it adopts the alternative RNA shape, causing stable messages to be formed and the therapeutic protein to be produced. 
 One of the features of our mammalian riboswitch is its range of regulation. Using a small molecule we were able to switch the riboswitch containing gene on to levels greater than 1,000x higher than in the absence of the small molecule. We believe this technology is viable for a therapeutic product and is also the first instance of a proprietary system for screening randomized aptamers and small molecules within mammalian cells for functional interactions. 
 Our Manufacturing Capabilities 
 We own and operate a cGMP manufacturing facility situated in London, United Kingdom. Supporting our global approach to clinical development and market supply, we designed the 29,000 square foot facility to meet multiple regulatory standards, including the Medicines and Health Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, in the UK, EMA and FDA standards. In the first quarter of 2018, we had our final MHRA certification inspection. In May 2018, we were granted a license to manufacture gene therapy product candidates in our cGMP compliant manufacturing facility by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. 
 We believe our facility can supply all of our current clinical and preclinical programs through regulatory approval and, should they be approved, provide sufficient capacity, for commercial production. Strategically, we believe our facility will minimize our dependence on third-party CMOs, which we believe provides a significant strategic, clinical and commercial advantage. 
 Our facility is flexible and scalable, with eleven independent air handling units, two cell culture suites and three separate viral vector production suites, which allows us to produce multiple product candidates in parallel, as well as sequentially at different scales. This allows us to accommodate up to three independent parallel manufacturing streams of viral vector products that are isolated within dedicated production areas. 
 
39 


 Our manufacturing facility includes an integrated analytical department and in-house analytical tool kit that allows for in-house release of clinical and commercial manufactured products. Equipped with dedicated areas for microbiology, molecular biology, and cell-based analytics. Our analytical department can perform product related assays, allowing us to retain and gain expertise that is normally lost to third parties. The close integration allows for rapid turnaround and flexibility in scheduling of key assays, reducing lead times for product candidate releases. Further, our dedicated product fill and finish suite allows us to manufacture a full range of clinical and commercial products under one roof and in our control. 
 We have more than 40 highly trained multidisciplinary staff on our manufacturing team with backgrounds in manufacturing, managing and delivering gene therapy products. 
 We have identified and licensed a proprietary HEK293 cell line that is well characterized and that we have banked in 400 vials. The specific cell line, size of the bank, culture media, and cryopreservation agents have been selected to facilitate bridging between process development platforms and targets. Our HEK-293 cells lack the T antigen component and are suitable for both the current adherent culture platform and the bioreactor process. We believe the ability to use the same cell line throughout the product and process development lifecycle will allow us to use a bracketed approach to process validation and comparability, which we believe may reduce the time and costs related to their implementation. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, significant competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. This is true in the field of gene therapy generally, and in the treatments for our key disease areas. While we believe that the strength of our team, gene therapy expertise, scientific knowledge and intellectual property provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from several sources, including large and small biopharmaceutical companies, academic research institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on gene therapy, but any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and product marketing than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, clinical programs. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 There are other organizations working to improve existing therapies or to develop new therapies for our initially selected disease indications. Depending on how successful these efforts are, it is possible they may increase the barriers to adoption and success for our product candidates, if approved. These efforts include two product candidates Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, or AGTC, have in Phase 1/2 clinical trials to treat ACHM related to CNGB3 and CNGA3, respectively, a product candidate in Phase 1/2 clinical trials by Nightstar Therapeutics plc and a program AGTC is running to treat XLRP, as well as Luxturna, which is marketed by Spark Therapeutics, Inc. and has been approved to treat RPE65-deficiency. We are not aware of any other gene therapy product candidates in clinical development targeting xerostomia. We are aware of other ALS gene therapies utilizing different treatment mechanisms to treat different genetically defined subsets of ALS patients, as well as gene therapy product candidates being developed for the treatment of Parkinsons disease, including those being developed by Voyager Therapeutics, Inc. and Axovant Sciences Ltd. 
 We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to 
 
40 


  compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in large part upon our ability to secure and maintain proprietary protection for our technologies and products and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or collaborating with our licensors to file U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also use other forms of protection, such as confidential information and trademark protection, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Our patent portfolio consists of a combination of issued patents and pending patent applications that are owned or licensed from third parties. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we own, have an exclusive license or co-exclusive license under, or an exclusive option to license 38 United States and foreign issued or allowed patents and 176 patent applications, pending in the United States and internationally. For any individual patent, the term depends on the applicable law in the country in which the patent is granted. In most countries where we have filed patent applications or in-licensed patents and patent applications, patents have a term of 20 years from the application filing date or earliest claimed non-provisional priority date. In the United States, the patent term is 20 years but may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent that expires earlier. The term of a U.S. patent may also be lengthened by a patent term adjustment, in order to address administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent. In the United States, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biologic may be eligible for patent term extension in order to restore the period of a patent term lost during the premarket FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the natural expiration of the patent. The patent term restoration period is generally equal to the regulatory review period for the approved product which period occurs after the date the patent issued, subject to certain exceptions. Only one patent may be extended for a regulatory review period for any product, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In the future, we may decide to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to extend its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.

This patent family includes four issued or allowed patents in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia, and one pending patent application in the United States. Patents issued from this family are expected to expire August 30, 2033, not including any patent term extensions or adjustments that may extend the patent term in certain jurisdictions. 
License Agreements 
 License Agreements with UCLB 
 We previously entered into several license agreements with UCLB, covering the following inherited retinal disease programs: (a) ACHM caused by mutations in CNGB3; (b) ACHM caused by mutations in CNGA3; (c) XLRP; and (d) RPE65-mediated IRD (together, the Licensed Gene Therapy Programs). The terms of these license agreements were set forth in (i) the license agreement, dated February 4, 2015, as amended, between Athena Vision Ltd. and UCLB (the First UCLB License Agreement); (ii) the license agreements, dated July 29, 2017, as amended, between MeiraGTx UKII Limited and UCL Business, Plc (the Second UCLB License Agreement); and (iii) the license agreement, dated March 15, 2018, among MeiraGTx Limited, MeiraGTx UKII Limited and UCL Business Plc (the Third UCLB License Agreement and, collectively, the prior UCLB license agreements). In January and February 2019, we amended and restated the prior UCLB license agreements to establish new standalone license agreement (each, a Stand­Alone UCLB Agreement) for each of the Licensed Gene Therapy Programs. We have removed from each of the Stand-alone Agreements our obligation to pay UCLB a share of certain sublicensing revenues as was provided under the First UCLB License Agreement and have aligned the material terms of the Stand-Alone Agreements to track those under the Third UCLB License Agreement as previously disclosed and a summary of which is set forth below as is now reflected in each of the Stand-Alone Agreements. 
 
43 


 Under the terms of the Third UCLB License Agreement, we paid an initial upfront payment of £6,994, and issued to UCLB £100,000 of our ordinary shares. Under the Stand-Alone Agreement related to CNGB3, we paid UCLB an upfront payment of £1.5 million and issued £1.5 million of our ordinary shares. 
 Under each of the Stand-Alone UCLB Agreements, UCLB granted us an exclusive, worldwide, and sublicensable license under certain intellectual property rights controlled by UCLB relating to one of the Licensed Gene Therapy Programs to develop and commercialize licensed products in a relevant field of gene therapy. We must use diligent efforts to develop and commercialize the licensed products. 
 Under the terms of each Stand-Alone UCLB Agreement, we are required to pay UCLB sales milestone payments of up to a total of £39.75 million in the aggregate and an annual management fee of £50,000 until certain royalty payments have been paid. Additionally, pursuant to the Stand-Alone UCLB Agreement related to CNGB3, we agreed to pay UCLB an upfront payment of £1.5 million and issue £1.5 million of the Companys ordinary shares. 
 Commencing on the first commercial sale of licensed products under each Stand-Alone UCLB Agreement, we must make low single-digit percentage royalty payments to UCLB on net sales of such products. Our royalty obligations under each agreement continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of the expiration of the last valid claim of a patent claiming such licensed product in such country, the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity for all licensed products in such country, or the tenth anniversary of first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. 
 Each Stand-Alone UCLB Agreement will remain in effect on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last payment obligation in such country. Each Stand-Alone UCLB Agreement may be terminated: (a) by either party in the event of the other partys material breach that remains uncured for 30 days (or for 14 days in the case of breaches related to payment obligations), (b) by either party for the other partys insolvency, (c) immediately by UCLB if we are in persistent breach of the agreement and the parties fail to agree upon a mechanism to remedy such persistent breach (or we do not comply with such agreed upon mechanism), or (d) immediately by UCLB if we undergo certain change of control events or if we enter into a sublicense with certain prohibited persons, which may adversely affect UCLs and/or UCLBs reputation. Each Stand-Alone UCLB Agreement may also be terminated or converted to a non-exclusive license by UCLB upon three months notice if we, based on an independent expert determination, fail to use diligent efforts to develop and commercially exploit licensed products and do not cure such failure within a certain cure period. 
 License Agreement between Bri-Alzan Inc. and Brandeis 
 In May 2013, BRI-Alzan Inc., or BRI-Alzan, entered into a license agreement with Brandeis, or the Brandeis Agreement. On December 31, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the BRI-Alzan Merger Agreement, with BRI-Alzan, and the Brandeis Agreement was assigned to us as a result of such merger. Pursuant to the terms of the BRI-Alzan Merger Agreement, we agreed to make cash payments to BRI-Alzan upon the achievement of certain milestones, subject to an aggregate cap of $4,500,000. In addition, we agreed to make low single-digit percentage royalty payments to BRI-Alzan on net sales of any product for the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of ALS that is covered by a valid claim of the patent rights licensed under the Brandeis Agreement. The BRI-Alzan Merger Agreement includes customary confidentiality, indemnification, non-competition and non-solicitation provisions. 
 
44 


 Pursuant to the Brandeis Agreement, Brandeis granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights with claims directed to compositions of matter and methods of use relating to our ALS gene therapy program and the AAV-UPF1 product candidate to develop and commercialize licensed products. 
 We must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products. We also acquired non-exclusive, worldwide licenses to certain know-how controlled by Brandeis to exploit licensed products. We are required to pay Brandeis developmental and regulatory milestone payments of up to a total of $1.0 million in the aggregate. We are also required to pay Brandeis annual license maintenance fees ranging from $15,000 to $100,000 depending on the development stage of the licensed product. Commencing on the first commercial sale of licensed products, we must make low single-digit percentage royalty payments to Brandeis on net sales of such products. In addition, we must pay Brandeis mid-teen percentages of sublicensing revenues. 
 The Brandeis Agreement will remain in effect on a country-by-country basis until the earlier of: (a) 1 year after the date that we, our affiliates or sublicensees last sell any licensed product in such country or (b) until the expiration of the lastto-expire of the licensed patent rights in such country. The Brandeis Agreement may be terminated by Brandeis for our insolvency or for our material breach that remains uncured for 60 days (or for 30 days in the case of breaches related to payment obligations). Such material breach may be cured only once in any 12-month period. Brandeis may also terminate any license granted under the Brandeis Agreement if we fail to timely achieve certain regulatory milestone events. 
 Trade Secrets 
 We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive advantage. Our policy requires inventors who are identified on any company-owned patent applications to assign rights to us. We also rely on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other advisors to protect our proprietary information. Our policy is to require third parties that receive material confidential information to enter into confidentiality agreements with us. 
Trademarks 
 Our trademark MeiraGTx has been registered in the European Union and United States. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting and export and import of products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, are extensive and require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
FDA Approval Process 
 We expect our future product candidates to be regulated as biologics. Biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FDCA and the PHSA and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, safety, testing, packaging, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of biological products. Before clinical testing of biological products in the United States may begin, we must submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the FDA, which reviews the clinical protocol, and the IND must become effective before clinical trials may begin. 
 
45 


 Gene therapy products must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agencies before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals. 
 Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. The FDA has published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy clinical trials for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs. 
 To date, the FDA has approved three human gene therapy products for sale, including Kite Pharmas Yescarta, Novartis Kymriah and Sparks Luxturna, and has provided general guidance regarding the development of gene therapy products. For example, the FDA has established the Office of Tissue and Advanced Therapies within CBER, to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee, to advise CBER on its reviews. In addition, the FDA has issued a growing body of clinical guidelines, chemical, manufacturing and control, or CMC, guidelines and other guidelines, all of which are intended to facilitate industrys development of gene therapy products. 
 Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene-editing technology, gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any product candidates. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 U.S. Biological Products Development Process 
 The FDA determined that more than minimally manipulated products must be approved by the FDA through the Biologics License Application, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

 | completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as preclinical laboratory tests, and preclinical studies and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including good laboratory practices, or GLPs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials according to the FDAs regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, potency and efficacy from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
46 


 
 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological products identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing and controls, information about product chemistry, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing, such as reproductive toxicity tests and carcinogenicity in animals, may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, after which human clinical trials may begin unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. In addition to the IND submission process, sponsors of certain human clinical trials of cells containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, including human gene transfer studies, had historically been subject to review by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, pursuant to the National Institutes of Healths Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. On August 17, 2018, the NIH issued a notice in the Federal Register and issued a public statement proposing changes to the oversight framework for gene therapy trials, including changes to the applicable NIH Guidelines to modify the roles and responsibilities of the RAC with respect to human clinical trials of gene therapy products, and requesting public comment on its proposed modifications. During the public comment period, which closed October 16, 2018, the NIH has announced that it will no longer accept new human gene transfer protocols for review as a part of the protocol registration process or convene the RAC to review individual clinical protocols. These trials will remain subject to the FDAs oversight and other clinical trial regulations, and oversight at the local level will continue as set forth in the NIH Guidelines. Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to the public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsors control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the efficacy measurements to be evaluated and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance 
 
47 


  with the FDAs regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials also must be reviewed by an IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a biological product. In rare instances, a single Phase 3 trial, together with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient to support a BLA submission. Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other trials, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsors initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or permanently discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA regulations. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA and the IRB may also halt, terminate or impose other conditions if either believes the patients are subject to unacceptable risk. 
 
48 


 There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. 
 Human gene therapy products based on gene-editing technology are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene transfer trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events in these trials. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing and distribution of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal trials, human trials, information on the manufacture, pharmacology, chemistry and controls of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. 
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include, among other things, an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including to the extent practicable study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information, along with any other information specified in FDA regulations. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by 
 
49 


  regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first human drug application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. Under PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals to complete the review of BLAs. The FDA may give a priority review designation to biological products that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the filing date rather than the receipt date for original BLAs, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. 
 The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the products identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product candidate. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified 
 
50 


  may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. Under the current PDUFA guidelines, the FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months of receipt depending on the type of information included. 
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its potential risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. 
 Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved BLA, including changes in indications, product labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies or surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 Additionally, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDAs policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act was signed into law. This act is intended, among other things, to modernize the regulation of drugs and biologics and to spur innovation, and contains provisions specific to the development of cell therapies. 
 One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in ten months from the filing date and 90% of priority BLAs in six months from the filing date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 The FDA may grant Orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from its sales in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 
51 


 In the United States, Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and BLA user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application, including a full BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan-designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitors product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic may request that the FDA designate the biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. The FDA must determine if the biologic product candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsors request. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biological product subject to accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing Phase 4 clinical trials. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing trials, will allow the FDA to withdraw the approved biologic product from the market on an expedited basis. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and 
 
52 


  accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 In addition, under the provisions of FDASIA, enacted in 2012, the FDA established a Breakthrough Therapy Designation which is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the features of Fast Track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, but these can also be granted to the same product candidate if the relevant criteria are met. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. All requests for breakthrough therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt, and FDA will either grant or deny the request. 
 Furthermore, as part of its implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA established the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designation, to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, certain drugs and biological products. A biological product is eligible for RMAT designation if it qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions, and is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the biological product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. Like breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Products granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. RMAT-designated products that receive accelerated approval may, as appropriate, fulfill their post-approval requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical trials, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence (such as electronic health records); through the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or via post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to approval of the therapy. 
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation and RMAT designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if we receive one of these designations for our product candidates, the FDA may later decide that our product candidates no longer meets the conditions for qualification. In addition, receiving these designations may not provide us with a material commercial advantage. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. 
 
53 


 After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturers tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. 
 To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA Act also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend biologics licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases within the United States. 
 The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market trials or surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. We also must comply with the FDAs advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the products approved labeling (known as off-label use), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
 Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost 
 
54 


  during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the products approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally equal to the regulatory review period for the approved product which period occurs after the date the patent issued, subject to certain exceptions. Only one patent may be extended for a regulatory review period for any product, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to extend its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 
 For patents that might expire during the BLA review phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent term extension. If eligible, an interim patent term extension may be granted for a period of not more than one year. The patent owner may apply for not more than four subsequent interim extensions. Any interim extension granted will not be longer than the maximum period of extension allowed post-approval. 
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, only a handful of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsors own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed interchangeable by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study. 
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other 
 
55 


  aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning of the BPCIA remains subject to significant uncertainty. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program; federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes which prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters; HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to the federal government, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which, in some cases, differ from each other in significant ways, and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance and individual imprisonment. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological product for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. 
 In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies 
 
56 


  in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing. 
 In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies share of sales to federal health care programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with ACAs individual mandate to carry health insurance. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the law.There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trumps administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the ACA. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level,CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors which, among other things, will affect rebates paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, the purpose of which is to further reduce the cost of drug products to consumers. Although some of these, and other proposals will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and 
 
57 


  marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
 U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or secure any improper advantage, or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any employee or official of a foreign government or public international organization, or political party, political party official, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The scope of the FCPA also includes employees and officials of state-owned or controlled enterprises, which may include healthcare professionals in many countries. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other foreign countries that impose similar obligations. 
Government Regulation Outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each countrys national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a countrys requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with European Union and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on GCPs. Additional GCP guidelines from the European Commission, focusing in particular on traceability, apply to clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the European Union, it must appoint an entity within the European Union to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide no fault compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial. 
 
58 


 Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee. The application for a clinical trial authorization must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Currently, clinical trial authorization applications must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU Member State in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is currently expected to take effect in 2019, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only a limited involvement. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Other national and European Union-wide regulatory requirements also apply. 
 During the development of a medicinal product, the EMA and national medicines regulators within the European Union provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical trials, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future marketing authorization application of the product concerned. 
 Marketing Authorizations 
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product. 
 The centralized procedure results in a single marketing authorization, or MA, granted by the European Commission that is valid across the EEA (i.e., the European Union as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) officially designated orphan medicines and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases. Therefore, the centralized procedure would be mandatory for the products we are developing. 
 The Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, is responsible in conjunction with the CHMP for the evaluation of ATMPs. The CAT is primarily responsible for the scientific evaluation of ATMPs and prepares a draft opinion on the quality, safety and efficacy of each ATMP for which a marketing authorization application is submitted. The CATs opinion is then taken into account by the CHMP when giving its final recommendation regarding the authorization of a product in view of the balance of benefits and risks identified. Although the CATs draft opinion is submitted to the CHMP for final approval, the CHMP may depart from the draft opinion, if it provides detailed scientific justification. The CHMP and CAT are also responsible for providing guidelines on ATMPs and have published numerous guidelines, including specific guidelines on gene therapies and cell therapies. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of ATMPs and include, among other things, the preclinical studies required to characterize ATMPs; the manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a marketing authorization application; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long term 
 
59 


  efficacy and potential adverse reactions of ATMPs. Although these guidelines are not legally binding, we believe that our compliance with them is likely necessary to gain and maintain approval for any of our product candidates. 
 Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days. This excludes so-called clock stops, during which additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. At the end of the review period, the CHMP provides an opinion to the European Commission. If this is opinion favorable, the Commission may then adopt a decision to grant an MA. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of an MAA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). This is usually when the product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. 
 The European Commission may grant a so-called conditional marketing authorization prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products), if (i) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (iii) the product fulfills an unmet medical need and (iv) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. 
 The European Commission may also grant a so-called marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances. Such authorization is intended for products for which the applicant can demonstrate that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided, or it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information. Consequently, marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances may be granted subject to certain specific obligations, which may include the following: 
 

 | the applicant must complete an identified program of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case of a radio-pharmaceutical, by an authorized person; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The package leaflet and any medical information must draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particulars available concerning the medicinal product in question are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects. 
 A marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is subject to annual review to reassess the risk-benefit balance in an annual reassessment procedure. Continuation of the authorization is linked to the annual reassessment and a negative assessment could potentially result in the marketing authorization being suspended or revoked. The renewal of a marketing authorization of a medicinal product under exceptional 
 
60 


  circumstances, however, follows the same rules as a normal marketing authorization. Thus, a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is granted for an initial five years, after which the authorization will become valid indefinitely, unless the EMA decides that safety grounds merit one additional five-year renewal. A marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances should not be granted when a conditional marketing authorization is more appropriate. 
 The European Union medicines rules expressly permit the EU Member States to adopt national legislation prohibiting or restricting the sale, supply or use of any medicinal product containing, consisting of or derived from a specific type of human or animal cell, such as embryonic stem cells. While the products we have in development do not make use of embryonic stem cells, it is possible that the national laws in certain EU Member States may prohibit or restrict us from commercializing our products, even if they have been granted an MA. 
 Data and Marketing Exclusivity 
 The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Marketing authorization applications for generic medicinal products do not need to include the results of preclinical and clinical trials, but instead can refer to the data included in the marketing authorization of a reference product for which regulatory data exclusivity has expired. In the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovators data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovators data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. 
 There is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product. There are no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be approved in the European Union. However, guidance from the EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory experience gained at the time. 
 Orphan Medicinal Products 
 Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity. During the ten-year market exclusivity period, the EMA cannot accept another application for a marketing authorization, or grant a marketing authorization or accept an application to extend an existing marketing authorization, for the same therapeutic indication, in respect of a similar medicinal product. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. 
 The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the 
 
61 


  European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the MAA. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the MAA if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, an MA may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if: 
 

 | the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

Pediatric Investigation Plan 
 In the EMA, MAAs for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of trials conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMAs Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which an MA is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data are not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the MA is obtained in all EU Member States and trial results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for a six-months supplementary protection certificate extension. 
 Post-Approval Controls 
 The holder of an MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs. 
 All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions. 
 All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer

62 


  advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each EU Member State and can differ from one country to another. 
 Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Governments influence the price of medicinal products in the European Union through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. 
 PRIME Scheme 
 In July 2016 the EMA launched PRIME scheme. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMAs support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is however not guaranteed. The benefits of a PRIME designation includes the appointment of a rapporteur from the CHMP before submission of an MAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review earlier in the application process. 
 UK Specials Regulation 
 The UKs Human Medicines Regulations 2012 allow for the manufacture and supply of medicinal products not authorized for marketing to patients with special needs at the request of the healthcare professional responsible for the patients care (these products are referred to as specials). A special may only be supplied in: (i) response to an unsolicited order from a healthcare professional responsible for the care of the patient, (ii) the product is manufactured and assembled in accordance with the specifications of that healthcare professional to fulfil the special needs of the individual patient which cannot be met by products already authorized for marketing, and (iii) the product is manufactured under a specials license granted by the UKs MHRA. 
 Manufacturing a special also imposes a five year record retention requirements subject to review by the MHRA, including details of any suspected adverse reaction to the product so sold or supplied of which the person is aware or subsequently becomes aware, as well as a continuing obligation to notify the MHRA of any suspected adverse reaction to the medicinal product which is a serious adverse reaction. 
 Privacy and Data Protection Laws 
 We are also subject to laws and regulations in non-U.S. countries covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. EU member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure, processing and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, contact information, and sensitive personal data such as health data. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations, and have generally become more stringent over time.

 The General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is a European framework law which imposes many requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals, if this is required, to process their personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention and secondary use of personal data, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data and additional obligations when we contract third-party processors in connection with the processing of t personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states to make additional laws and regulations further limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to 20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. 
 The United Kingdom is expected to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019 further to the Brexit referendum. The UKs Data Protection Act 2018, or DPA2018, governs the UKs privacy regime and will continue to do so after the United Kingdom exits the EU. The DPA2018 incorporates the GDPRs text in full, with only minor amendments and further derogations including those pertaining to the processing of health data. Accordingly, the terms of the GDPR, and its significant penalties, will continue to apply after the UK exits the EU. At time of writing, it is still unclear whether the UK will be granted adequacy by the European Commission. In any event, for, at least, an interim period, export mechanisms, such as Model Clauses, will likely need to be put in place to govern the transfer of personal data from the EU to the UK.
