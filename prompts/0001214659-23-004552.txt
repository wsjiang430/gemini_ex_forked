ITEM 1. BUSINESS. Overview
History of Value Exchange International, Inc.
 
History. We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 26, 2007. We changed to our current corporate name, “Value Exchange International, Inc.”, on December 5, 2017.
 
Current Business Focus. We are a provider of customer-centric technology solutions for the retail industry in Hong Kong SAR and certain regions of China and Philippines. Due to impact of Coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID 19 pandemic”) and lack of adequate funding for business expansion into Southeast Asia, our strategic plan to expand our business into Southeast Asia made no progress in fiscal year 2022.
 
By integrating market-leading Point-of-Sale/Point-of-Interaction (“POS/POI”), Merchandising, Customer Relations Management or “CRM” and related rewards, Locational Based (GPS & Indoor Positioning System (“IPS”)) Marketing, Customer Analytics, Business Intelligence solutions, our products and services are intended to provide retailers with the capability to offer a consistent shopping experience across all channels, enabling them to easily and effectively manage the customer lifecycle on a one-to-one basis. We promote ourselves as a single IT source for retailers who want to extend existing traditional transaction processing to multiple points of interaction, including the Internet, kiosks and wireless devices. Our products and services are focused on helping retailers realize the full benefits of Customer Chain Management with its suite of solutions that focus on the customer, on employees, and the infrastructure that supports the selling channel. Company is headquartered in Hong Kong and with offices in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, China; Manila, Philippines; and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
 
We believe that the IT Business often presents opportunities to expand a provider’s market reach or customer base by acquisitions of existing businesses or operating assets. The Company’s business strategy includes reviewing possible acquisitions of existing businesses or operating assets in existing or adjacent markets and to do so when and if such an acquisition appears to be compatible and an enhancement of our core business lines and can be consummated with available cash and other resources. Our ability to pursue and consummate acquisitions may be limited, and has been limited, by available cash for mergers and acquisitions and other resources and the perceived cost and burdens of acquiring and integrating the target business or new operating assets into our operations. The availability of funding and cash flow are the most significant limitations on our ability to expand through acquisitions of businesses and assets – both in terms of money on hand and ability to finance acquisitions, but the estimated business hurdles in successfully penetrating a new market is also a factor in deciding whether to proceed with that expansion. The limited liquidity and bid price of our Common Stock in the public stock market also hampers our ability to use shares of Common Stock as attractive consideration to target companies in a merger or acquisition.
 
Initial Business Focus. Our initial intended, primary business was to operate a credit card processing and merchant-acquiring services company that provide credit card clearing services to merchants and financial institutions in PRC. From inception, we strove unsuccessfully to create and establish a proposed Global Processing Platform concept to support the credit card processing services (“SinoPay GPP”). Specifically, the Company’s Internet Protocol business was to be a provider of Internet Protocol (“IP”) processing services in Asia to bank card-accepting merchants (“IP Business”). The Company efforts to establish a viable IP Business did not succeed.
 
The acquisition of VEI CHN in 2014 shifted the primary business focus to the IT Business because IT Business provided a more readily attainable revenue generating business line and because of our strategic decision that IT Business presented a greater growth and profit potential than IP Business. Further, we believe that the SinoGPP system would require ongoing and potentially expensive marketing and sales effort as well as extensive technical upgrades and function enhancements due to the highly competitive market for Point Of Sale (“POS”) systems and longer sales cycle for POS systems than IT Business project and consulting sales. VEI CHN was acquired in a stock-for-stock exchange (“VEI CHN Share Exchange”).
 
Smart Baggage Tags. Through a cooperative effort with another company, Company has the ability to market a smart baggage tag that allows consumers to track the location of their baggage through a smart phone or device using the smart baggage tag and related application. Efforts to promote the smart baggage tag were suspended in 2021 and 2022 due to impact of COVID-19 pandemic on air travel. As of the filing of this Form 10-K, there are no current plans to make any dedicated marketing effort for expanding the market for or sales of the smart baggage tags in 2023.

History of Value Exchange Int’l (China) Limited. VEI CHN was first established on November 16, 2001 in Hong Kong as a limited liability company. VEI CHN is a holding company with two subsidiaries established in Hong Kong, namely TAP Services (HK) Limited which was incorporated on August 25, 2003 and acquired by VEI CHN on September 25, 2008, and subsequently changed to its current name as Value Exchange Int’l (Hong Kong) Limited (“VEI HKG”) on May 13, 2013, and Cucumbuy.com Limited (“CUCUMBUY”), which was incorporated on May 14, 2013 and disposed on May 21, 2018 with consideration of HK$1. VEI CHN also set up a Wholly-owned Foreign Enterprise (WOFE) in Shanghai, PRC, in September 2, 2008 in the name of Value Exchange Int’l (Shanghai) Limited (“VEI SHG”). In January 2017, VEI CHN acquired TapServices, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines (the “TSI”). Prior to acquisition of TSI, the Company provided extensive consulting services to TSI and, from such relationship, the Company was familiar with TSI operations. In January 2019, VEI SHG completed the setup procedures of a subsidiary with 51% ownership in Hunan, PRC, in the name of Value Exchange Int’l (Hunan) Limited (“VEI HN”). In February 2020, VEI SHG completed the setup procedures of a subsidiary with 51% ownership in Shanghai, PRC, in the name of Shanghai Zhaonan Hengan Information Technology Co., Limited (“SZH”). In January 2022, VEI HKG completed the setup procedures of a subsidiary with 100% ownership in Shenzhen, PRC, in the name of Haomeng Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Limited. (“HTS”).
 
Principal business of VEI and its Subsidiaries
 
VEII is a holding company for its operating subsidiaries. VEI CHN operations are the primary operations of the Company. The principal business of VEI CHN for more than 15 years is to provide the IT Business (consisting of select services and solutions in computer software programming and integration, and computer systems, Internet and information technology systems engineering, consulting, administration, installation and maintenance, including e-commerce and payment processing) to the Retail Sector, primarily to retailers in Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR and PRC and as more fully described below. As is customary in the industry, such services and solutions are provided by both company employees, contractors and consultants. The primary services and products of the IT Business are:
 

a) | Systems maintenance and related service
---+----------------------------------------

 
VEI CHN Group provides development and customization of software and hardware, enhancements thereto and maintenance services for installed POS system. VEI CHN Group markets, sells and maintains its own brand POS software – edgePOS as well as third party brands (e.g. NCR/Retalix), which is one of the leading POS software programs in the Chinese-Hong Kong market. These software enhancements and programming can integrate with different IP systems.
 
Systems maintenance services consist of: i) software maintenance service, including software patches and software code revisions; ii) installing, testing and implementing software; iii) training of customer personnel for the use of software; and iv) technical support for software systems.
 
Other services include system installation and implementation, including i) project planning; ii) analysis of customer information and business needs from a IT perspective (“System Analysis”); iii) design of the entire system; iv) hardware and consumables selection advice and sales; and v) system hardware maintenance. These services typically consist of customer projects for New Store Opening (“NSO”) and Install, Move, Add and Change (“IMAC”) for retail, and ad-hoc custom system projects for other business sectors. Our primary focus is the retail sector in Hong Kong, PRC and Philippines.
 

b) | Systems development and integration
---+------------------------------------

 
VEI CHN Group provides value-added software, which integrates with customer owned or licensed software, and ad-hoc software development projects for other business sectors. Besides use of proprietary, custom software code, our services may from time to time license standard third party software programs.
 
Business partner and customers
 
The main business partner of the IT Business group is the Chinese and Hong Kong subsidiary operations (“WN”) of Diebold Nixdorf Inc. (formerly, “Wincor Nixdorf AG”, a German public company), a U.S.-German public company subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, (“DN”). Since 1990’s, VEI CHN Group served the AS Watson Group, a retail conglomerate including Watsons, Parknshop and Fortress, directly and through a sub-contracting arrangement with WN in the China-Hong Kong region. This contributes almost half of the gross sales revenue each year to VEI CHN.
 
In recent years, VEI CHN has striven to broaden its clientele in retail sector and to other business sectors. VEI CHN Group secured a number of service contracts for leading retail groups, Robinson Retails Group in Philippines and Dairy Farm in Hong Kong. PCCW, a leading telecommunication company in Hong Kong, and Inland Revenue Department of the Hong Kong Government have also become major customers of the VEI CHN Group. The focus on expanding clientele in the retail sector is a current priority of Company’s growth strategy.

The annual sales of VEI CHN Group have been increasing over the past few years in its IT Business by expanding its customer base and its scope of services. VEI CHN Group solution now runs in over 10,000 POS in the region and provides a solid foundation to VEII’s services for IP systems. Also, VEI CHN Group is seeking to leverage its existing POS solution customer base to expand into the mobile Customer Relationship Management and Rewards market. The importance of the mobile market in commerce is globally recognized. Even through the Mobile Customer Relationship Management and Rewards programs has not produced any significant revenues to the VEI CHN Group, the programs seek to exploit the increasing use of mobile devices to shop and purchase products and services, to sustain consumer loyalty by rewards for repeat purchases by mobile devices and to permit companies to develop consumer profile databases used to fashion targeted marketing to the consumers based on purchasing habits. We provide no assurances that we will be able to develop a profitable or significant mobile market program or operation. Further, mobile applications and products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. Mobile application products and services may have multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system.
 
We will evaluate the merits of this business and growth strategy from time to time and may elect in the future to continue our IT Business focus, or focus more on one segment than the other, including seek business opportunities in the applications of digital technology which we believe can raise our customers’ competitive edge leading to possible increase in market share and profitability in their business sectors. Any change in business focus will be based on current economic conditions, competitive environment, our available cash and infrastructure resources, current customer demand trends and financial results of each segment of our post-VEI CHN Share Exchange business plan. As of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K, we are pursuing our emphasis on IT Business in our core Hong Kong SAR and PRC market while also exploring expansion opportunities in adjacent Asia Pacific markets. Our ability to exploit adjacent market opportunities for expansion will be limited and governed by available, affordable funding and cash flow as well as consideration of business and regulatory hurdles in penetrating a new market.

CORPORATE STRUCTURE
 
Our corporate organizational chart, as of December 31, 2022, is as follows:
 


Note a: The remaining 49% share equity of VEI HN is owned by Li Gongyuan, a Chinese national.
 Note b: The remaining 49% share equity of SZH is owned by Shanghai Nanan Cosmeceutical Technology Development Limited, a Chinese company, which 54.6% share is effectively controlled by Li Chengliang, a Chinese national.
Marketing
 
Marketing activities are designed to inform potential clients about the benefits of using our services and include and will include the following: face-to-face sales and marketing (including online presentations); development and distribution of marketing literature; direct mail and email; advertising; promotion of our web site; attendance at trade shows or product seminars; and industry analyst relations campaign.
 
Sales are managed at the subsidiary level by each subsidiary. The Company has a Sales and Marketing team in each regional office of its existing China/Hong Kong and Manilla markets to promote and maintain good business relationships with our customers. We strive to provide high quality and fast response services to our customers in our Help Centre, Maintenance Support Team and Professional IT Engineer to help customers solve their problems and satisfy their IT needs.
 
VEI CHN Group has been serving in IT Business sectors for over 15 years, focusing on POS maintenance and support to retail sector. The VEI CHN Group will continue its key business and seek to expand its client base to gain more market share in PRC, Hong Kong, and certain other areas of Asia Pacific. VEII may consider acquiring companies in the Asia Pacific region with similar business, subject to financial wherewithal to do so and subject to a suitable and affordable acquisition opportunity. The perceived cost of market penetration will also be a factor in deciding whether to pursue any acquisition opportunities, which calculation includes strength of competition and other business hurdles as well as regulatory hurdles in establishing a new market. While the Company has secured a convertible credit line for $1.5 million in late January 2023 and revolving credit line for $1 million in July 2022, the Company and its subsidiaries do not currently have ready access to funding dedicated for acquisitions and would have to locate sufficient, affordable funding to pursue any acquisition or merger with a significant cash consideration requirement. Funding from the credit lines is primarily dedicated as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K to operating expenses and business development of operations in existing markets. The Company evaluates the use of funding from credit lines from time to time and the use of proceeds, which may include business expansion, may be applied to future expansion into new markets in the future. The Company and its subsidiaries may be unable to locate the funding, whether equity or increased debt funding, needed to consummate a merger or acquisition requiring a significant cash consideration or significant post-acquisition working capital, especially since the Company is a small reporting company with a “penny stock” common stock that is not typically suitable for significant equity funding and Company lacks the tangible assets usually required for securing significant debt financing.

We use strategic partnerships as another way of marketing and selling our IT Business. The operating subsidiaries will also cooperate with strategic partners in the local markets to secure and provide maintenance services to major retail customers and as a basis for attempting to expand our business in our markets. In fiscal year 2022, we had over 10 strategic partner arrangements engaged in providing our services to customers in our China/Hong Kong markets.
 
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive, customer-driven industry and we compete against a variety of local and regional competitors of varying operational sizes, product/service offerings and resources. In some instances, our competitors have greater market share and consumer loyalty and brand-name recognition, fewer regulatory burdens, easier access to financing (whether debt or equity funding and greater and easier access to equity funding through sales of their equity securities to the public), greater operating resources, greater operating capabilities and efficiencies of scale (including technology personnel, research and development capabilities, joint venture partners and marketing-sales channels), longstanding relationships with regulatory authorities and customers, more customers, and more flexibility to offer discounted services or products.
 
We face significant competition from large multinational service providers, such as DN, NCR, Fujitsu IBM, Toppan Forms and large national companies, such as Octopus card, an electronic payment in online or offline system in Hong Kong. Though VEI CHN Group faces keen competition in the maintenance service market, it believes that it has a well-trained technical team that offers services to the satisfaction of our customers, and as is the case with many smaller companies in the IT segment, we believe we can offer more customized and cost effective services to certain customers than larger competitors. Without extensive teaming with strategic partners, we lack the capabilities to compete directly with larger competitors in projects or work requiring capabilities of a large company. This can from time to time limit the number and nature projects that we can pursue or handle. VEII may also experience a competitive disadvantage in bids or prospective work where extensive and broad prior projects in certain areas of IT are required to bid and to win bids. An instance of such a competitive disadvantage would be technical work in which we do not have extensive prior experience and cannot attain the required technical proficiency, or we do not have a prior relationship with the customer in question.
 
We also face competition from companies that are of comparable size and resources. In such competition, price and scope of services or qualification of personnel often determines the winning provider. Competition for qualified personnel is an ongoing and significant challenge faced by all companies in the IT Business industry.
 
Preservation and growth of our business depends on maintaining sufficient, competent staff and attractive pricing.
 
Some of our competitors in our industry have substantially greater capital and technical resources than we have and, operate as subsidiaries of financial institutions or bank holding companies, which may allow them on a consolidated basis to own and conduct depository and other banking activities that we do not have the regulatory authority to own or conduct. Since they are affiliated with financial institutions or banks, these competitors do not incur the costs associated with being sponsored by a bank for registration with card networks and they can settle transactions quickly for their own merchants. We do not, however, currently contemplate pursuing an acquisition or strategic relationship with a financial institution in order to increase our competitiveness and such an acquisition or strategic relationship is not prominent in our current business and growth strategy. Our current operational focus is to improve the efficiency and profitability of existing IT Business.
 
Cybersecurity and Security of Computer Networks
 
We maintain certain computer networks, computer systems and databases in connection with our business operations and services. We use readily available third party security programs to protect these systems and databases and we periodically review security measures. Any security system or program may be vulnerable to hacking or security breaches, especially since hacking and malicious programs are constantly evolving to overcome new security measures. Like any company’s computer and network systems and databases, our systems and databases could be vulnerable to security hacking or malicious programs. We may also be vulnerable to security leaks and violations by employees and contractors, which is a threat faced by all IT Business companies. We have not experienced any significant security breaches or problems as of the date of filing of this Form 10-K. VEII technical staff typically evaluates cybersecurity and security measures from time to time as new threats become known to us.

There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our computer systems, networks and other information systems will prevent any of the problems identified as cyber security attacks or problems. The problem of this type might be caused by events such as computer hacking, computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, "cyber-attacks" and other malicious activity, defects in the hardware and software comprising our network and information systems, as well as natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks and similar events. Such events could have an adverse impact on us and our customers, including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to help centers and damage to our or customers’ equipment and data. Operational or business delays for our operations or customer operations may result from the disruption of computer systems, network or information systems and the subsequent remediation activities. These events may create negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with customers and our results of operations could suffer. Since we provide computer, software and system services and products to customers, cyber security attacks on our computer systems, networks and other information systems may affect our customers’ computer systems, networks and other information systems and produce liabilities on our part to such customers.
 
Due to the evolving and often very sophisticated nature of cyber security threats, cyber security is an ongoing challenge for all IT Business companies like us. Even the most diligent compliance with industry standards for cybersecurity can fail to defeat all cyber security attacks.
 
Key Personnel
 
The following personnel are considered critical to our operations: Kenneth Tan and Benny Lee, who provide executive management services and strategic direction. Mr. Lee serves as a director of VEI SHG. We do not have key man insurance to fund replacement of any key personnel. We also frequently use third party consultants acting as independent contractors to assist in the completion of various projects, which consultants are usually hired on a project-by-project basis. Third parties are instrumental to keep the development of projects on time and on budget. Reliance on independent contractors is common in technology services businesses. We do not anticipate and have not experienced any significant problem in securing needed technical expertise, but the inability to secure needed technical expertise is a risk faced by IT service companies like our company.
 
The Company has not developed a formal succession plan in the event of the retirement, disability or death of key personnel. In the event of the loss of the services of any key personnel, the Company would in all likelihood be forced to recruit an outside person to fill a key personnel position or rely on existing officers to perform the duties of key personnel. The Company may lack sufficient cash and benefits to attract qualified personnel for key personnel positions.
 
A common problem in our industry is key or important contractors and employees being lured to more attractive or lucrative work opportunities. VEII cannot typically match the level and scope of financial incentives offered by larger competitors to workers. VEII has to rely on active recruitment coupled with offering projects that match workers’ skills and interests as well as providing an appealing work environment and competitive base compensation in order to maintain or create an adequate work force on a project-by-project basis. VEII adopted a 2022 Equity Incentive Plan in 2022, but VEII has not issued any stock-based compensation under that plan as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K. Company will evaluate the need or benefit of granting incentive company under the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan in 2023. Since the Company’s Common Stock is a penny stock, incentive compensation may not be a significant benefit to attract or retain personnel.
 
Insurance
 
Except the Company’s subsidiaries in (i) PRC are required to cover its employees with medical, retirement and unemployment insurance programs, and (ii) Hong Kong are required to cover its employees with labor insurance programs under the prevailing laws and regulations of the PRC and in Hong Kong, we do not maintain other insurance. Because we may not have sufficient insurance, if we are made a party to a liability legal action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation or may suffer another liability. If that occurs a judgment or liability that is not covered by any insurance or covered by available cash or funding, could cause us to cease or reduce operations. We did not experience any significant claims against our insurance in fiscal year 2022.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to U.S. federal securities laws and the corporate laws of the State of Nevada. With respect to regulation of our IT Business, especially in segments related to the Internet, the Internet is increasingly popular and essential on a global basis and is subject to changing and sometimes expanding regulation. As a result, it is possible that a number of international and local laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet applications and transactions, including ones used in or serviced by our service. These laws may cover issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, content and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and information security. Furthermore, the growth of electronic commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws. Existing and future laws and regulations governing the privacy of end users or their customers’ information is or may become part of the regulatory burden of conducting our business lines. We do not provide our services in the U.S. as of the date of this Form 10-K, but the global nature of the Internet and e-commerce and financial transactions means that any company may become subject from time to time to U.S. or foreign laws on privacy, financial regulation, business regulation or tax law.

We are not certain how our existing business may be affected by the application of existing, evolving laws, or extension of foreign laws to our operations and, governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights, encryption and other intellectual property issues, taxation, libel, obscenity and export or import matters. The vast majority of such laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet or are typically aimed at Internet providers or Internet IT companies with international operations. However, we may become subject and affected by Internet related laws and regulation in the future, especially in China and Hong Kong where the Chinese government has a heightened concern about national security threats through the Internet. Changes in laws intended to address such issues could create uncertainty in the Internet market place, including areas affecting our business lines. Such uncertainty could reduce demand for services or increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation or regulatory costs or increased service delivery costs. In addition, because our services could be available over the Internet in multiple states and foreign countries, other jurisdictions may claim that we are required to qualify to do business in each such state or foreign country. Our failure to qualify a business in a jurisdiction where it is required to do so could subject it to taxes and penalties. It could also hamper our ability to enforce contracts in such jurisdictions. The application of laws or regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Like many companies, and from time to time, the Company may review the economic and tax advantages of various jurisdictions for businesses like the Company business in order to determine if there are any significant long-term advantages in relocating or expanding the Company operations to another jurisdiction, whether in whole or in part. Any such review is part of the customary strategic planning of the Company.
 
As a U.S. incorporated company, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, or “FCPA,” and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our activities in Asia create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by consultants or agents of our company, because these parties are not always subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. Also, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and consultants, sales agents of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The U.S. government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability for any FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.
 
Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. (“HFCAA”); PCAOB Vacates Determination regarding Inability to Fully Investigate and Inspect Chinese and Hong Kong Auditors. On December 15, 2022, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board or “PCAOB” announced it was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate public audit firms in the China and Hong Kong SAR for the first time. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB Board voted to vacate previous determinations that it was unable to fully inspect and investigate Chinese and Hong Kong public auditors of companies reporting under the Exchange Act.  As originally enacted, the HFCAA required the SEC to initially prohibit trading in the securities of an issuer that is a Commission-identified issuer for three consecutive years.  On December 29, 2022, the President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2023, which, among other things, amends the HFCAA to reduce this timeframe from three consecutive years to two consecutive years. On December 18, 2022, the SEC announced that due to the December 15, 2022 action by the PCAOB, and until such time as the PCAOB issues any new determination, there are no SEC-reporting companies at risk of having their securities subject to a trading prohibition under the HFCAA. As such, as of the date of this filing of this Form 10-K, the Company is not a Commission Identified Issuer under the HFCAA and is not subject to having its Common Stock delisted under HFCAA.
 
The following is a discussion of events prior to the SEC December 18, 2022 determination that there were no longer any Commission-identified issuers subject to HFCAA and possible delisting of their equity securities on U.S. public markets.
 
Prior Developments under HFCAA and Related SEC Rules. As of May 13, 2022, the SEC conclusively identified the Company as a Commission Identified Issuer under the HFCAA and underlying SEC rules. As a result of our identification as a Commission Identified Issuer, our Common would have been delisted from the OTCQB if Company’s current public auditor was not able to be fully audited and inspected by the PCAOB for three consecutive fiscal years (shortened to two years by the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2023), commencing with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and listing and trading in Company our Common Stock would have been prohibited in United States as early as 2024. Our current public auditor was identified by the PCAOB as being an auditor that cannot be fully audited and investigated by the PCAOB due to Chinese government policies. The risks and uncertainty associated with being identified as a Commission Identified Issuer and possible delisting of our Common Stock under the HFCAA could have had a negative impact on investors’ confidence in our Common Stock as an investment and thereby adversely impacted the price of our Common Stock, which adverse impact could have resulted in volatility in trading price of our Common Stock or possibly rendered illiquid an investment in our Common Stock.

Compromise by PCAOB and China on HFCAA. On August 26, 2022, the SEC issued a Statement on Agreement Governing Inspections and Investigations of Audit Firms Based in China and Hong Kong (“August 26, 2022 Compromise”). Under the August 26, 2022 Compromise, the PCAOB, China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”), and Ministry of Finance of People’s Republic of China established a framework that allowed the PCAOB to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong. The PCAOB began efforts in the last calendar quarter of 2022 to investigate and audit public auditors in China and Hong Kong in accordance with the August 26, 2022 Compromise and, as discussed above, PCAOB determined that it could fully investigate and audit Chinese and Hong Kong public auditors in December 2022.
 
Chinese and Hong Kong Business Permits and Regulation. As a general business legal requirement, Company’s Chinese subsidiaries are required to obtain a business license from the State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”). Each of our Chinese subsidiaries has obtained a valid business license from the SAMR, and no application for any such license has been denied. Further, to operate our general business activities currently conducted in China, our relevant Chinese subsidiaries may also be required to obtain other permits from the Chinese government. Company’s Chinese subsidiaries have obtained the necessary permits applicable to them and no application for such permits has been denied by authorities. Our Hong Kong and Philippines subsidiaries likewise have all local government permits to operate their respective businesses. As of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K, the Company and each of its subsidiaries have obtained all licenses and permits required to conduct their respective businesses in all jurisdictions in which those businesses are conducted. Further, except for grants or awards of equity based incentive compensation to Chinese nationals employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, which has not occurred as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K, the Company has all necessary permits and licenses from Chinese and Hong Kong governments to issue securities to foreign investors. Any permits or licenses necessary to operation of the Company and its subsidiaries that are not usual and customary business licenses and permits required of all for-profit businesses in the locality in question are described in this section.
 
With respect to Chinese and Hong Kong requirements for business or other operational approvals, permits, licenses, or registration requirements necessary to operate our businesses in China and Hong Kong (collectively, “Permits”), the Company and its subsidiaries have not historically been adversely affected by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required Permits. However, we cannot predict the effect that the compliance with Chinese and Hong Kong laws and regulations and changes in those laws and regulations may have on our ability to obtain required Permits in the future, especially in light of increasing Chinese government intervention and unilateral modification of Hong Kong laws, regulations and policies.
 
Based on consultation with Company’s Hong Kong legal counsel as to Chinese and Hong Kong laws, the Company does not believe that: (1) the laws and regulations of China have had an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations in Hong Kong in fiscal year 2022, (2) that Company has a requirement to obtain any permission or approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”), Cyberspace Administration of China (“CAC”) or any other regulatory authority in China for the Company or subsidiary operations for the trading of our common stock or other securities on the OTCQB and the issuance of our securities to foreign investors, except, based on guidance from our Hong Kong legal counsel, that: the Chinese government’s Central State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE") adopted regulations in 2007 that require the registration with SAFE of any grants of equity based incentive compensation to Chinese nationals employed by a foreign (non-Chinese) company with its securities listed on a foreign exchange or employed by a Chinese subsidiary of such a foreign listed company. Chinese nationals serving as officers and directors are included in the definition of “Chinese employees.” Grants to non-Chinese nationals or a permanent residency permit in another country do not require approval or registration under the 2007 regulations. Under 2012 regulations adopted by SAFE for equity-based grants to Chinese employees by foreign companies with securities listed on foreign exchanges: (1) the scope of registration includes grants or issuances of stock options, stock purchase rights, stock appreciation rights, phantom awards, performance awards, restricted stock (units) and a catch-all "other type of awards” to Chinese employees to be registered with SAFE; and (2) nationals of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan working for the foreign company in China may be included, but are not required to be included, in the registration with SAFE. The registration is filed in the SAFE office in the province in which the foreign company’s Chinese subsidiary is located. The main purpose of the 2007 and 2012 regulations is to allow the Chinese government to monitor incentive compensation received by Chinese nationals from foreign companies with securities listed on foreign exchanges. The Company adopted an incentive plan in July 2022, the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (“Plan”), but has not granted or issued any equity based grants or awards under the Plan. The Company will register any equity-based grants or awards under the Plan to Chinese employees (including officers and directors) prior to approving any such grants or awards. Registration of awards to Chinese employees will also require the Company to file quarterly and annual reports on equity-based awards to Chinese employees with SAFE as well as renew the SAFE registration of the equity based plan on an annual basis.
 
Based on guidance from Hong Kong legal counsel to the Company, the Company and its operations are not subject to and not impacted by the Chinese cybersecurity-data laws described in this Chinese and Hong Kong Business Permits and Regulation in 2022. The Company and its subsidiaries in China and Hong Kong do not collect the kind of data or act as a data center for information that is the focus of and under the purview of the Chinese national security and cybersecurity laws. Due to the uncertainty of the application or changes in law and regulation in China and Hong Kong, there is no assurance that the Company or its Chinese or Hong Kong operations will not become subject to Chinese cybersecurity-data laws.
