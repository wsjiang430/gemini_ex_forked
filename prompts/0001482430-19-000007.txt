ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed on December 22, 2009 as a Maryland corporation that elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2011 and it intends to continue to operate in such a manner. As used herein, the terms “we,” “our” and “us” refer to the Company and as required by context, KBS Limited Partnership III, a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as our “Operating Partnership,” and to their subsidiaries. We conduct our business primarily through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner.
We have invested in a diverse portfolio of real estate investments. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 28 office properties and one mixed-use office/retail property and had entered into a consolidated joint venture to develop and subsequently operate a multifamily apartment project, which is currently under construction. 
On February 4, 2010, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to offer a minimum of 250,000 shares and a maximum of up to 280,000,000 shares, or up to $2,760,000,000 of shares, of common stock for sale to the public, of which up to 200,000,000 shares, or up to $2,000,000,000 of shares, were registered in our primary offering and up to 80,000,000 shares, or up to $760,000,000 of shares, were registered under our dividend reinvestment plan. We ceased offering shares of common stock in our primary offering on May 29, 2015 and terminated the primary offering on July 28, 2015.
We sold 169,006,162 shares of common stock in our now-terminated primary initial public offering for gross offering proceeds of $1.7 billion. As of December 31, 2018, we had also sold 27,926,537 shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of $280.9 million. Also as of December 31, 2018, we had redeemed 19,687,309 shares sold in our initial public offering for $210.5 million.
Additionally, on October 3, 2014, we issued 258,462 shares of common stock, for $2.4 million, in private transactions exempt from the registration requirements pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.
We continue to offer shares under our dividend reinvestment plan. In some states, we will need to renew the registration statement annually or file a new registration statement to continue the dividend reinvestment plan offering. We may terminate our dividend reinvestment plan offering at any time.
As our advisor, KBS Capital Advisors manages our day-to-day operations and our portfolio of real estate investments. KBS Capital Advisors makes recommendations on all investments to our board of directors. All proposed investments must be approved by at least a majority of our board of directors, including a majority of the conflicts committee. Unless otherwise provided by our charter, the conflicts committee may approve a proposed investment without action by the full board of directors if the approving members of the conflicts committee constitute at least a majority of the board of directors. KBS Capital Advisors also provides asset-management, disposition, marketing, investor-relations and other administrative services on our behalf. Our advisor owns 20,000 shares of our common stock. We have no paid employees.
Objectives and Strategies
Our primary investment objectives are to preserve and return our stockholders’ capital contributions and to provide our stockholders with attractive and stable cash distributions. We will also seek to realize growth in the value of our investments by timing asset sales to maximize asset value.
2018 Investment Highlights
In 2017, we acquired a 75% equity interest in an existing company and created an unconsolidated joint venture with an unaffiliated developer to develop and subsequently operate a 12-story office building and an adjacent two-story office/retail building in the Denver submarket of Greenwood Village, Colorado (together, “Village Center Station II”). The total cost of the Village Center Station II development was $111.2 million and our initial capital contribution to the Village Center Station II joint venture was $32.3 million. In May 2018, the Village Center Station II development project was substantially completed and we purchased the developer’s 25% equity interest for $28.2 million in October 2018.

Real Estate Portfolio
Other than our investments in a joint venture to develop and subsequently operate a two-building apartment complex located on the developable land at Gateway Tech Center (“Hardware Village”) and Village Center Station II, we have made investments in core real estate properties, which are generally lower risk, existing properties with at least 80% occupancy and minimal near-term lease rollover. Our primary investment focus has been core office properties located throughout the United States, though we may also invest in other types of properties. Our core property focus in the U.S. office sector has reflected a more value-creating core strategy. In many cases, these properties have slightly higher (10% to 15%) vacancy rates and/or higher near-term lease rollover at acquisition than more conservative value-maintaining core properties. These characteristics may provide us with opportunities to lease space at higher rates, especially in markets with increasing absorption, or to re-lease space at higher rates, bringing below-market rates of in-place expiring leases up to market rates. Many of these properties have required or will require a moderate level of additional investment for capital expenditures and tenant improvement costs in order to improve or rebrand the properties and increase rental rates. Thus, we believe these properties provide an opportunity for us to achieve more significant capital appreciation by increasing occupancy, negotiating new leases with higher rental rates and/or executing enhancement projects.
The core office properties in which we have invested include low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise office buildings and office parks in urban and suburban locations in or near central business districts with access to transportation.
We generally hold fee title to the real estate properties in our portfolio. We have also made investments through joint ventures and in the future we may enter into other joint ventures, partnerships and co-ownership arrangements (including preferred equity investments) or participations for the purpose of obtaining interests in real estate properties and other real estate investments.
We generally intend to hold our core properties for three to seven years, which we believe is a reasonable period to enable us to capitalize on the potential for increased income and capital appreciation of properties. However, economic and market conditions have influenced us to hold certain real estate properties for different periods of time.
We have invested all of the proceeds from our now-terminated initial public offering in a diverse portfolio of real estate investments. From time to time, and based upon asset sales, availability under our debt facilities or market conditions, we may seek to make additional real estate investments.
We may make adjustments to our target portfolio based on real estate market conditions and investment opportunities. We will not forego a good investment because it does not precisely fit our expected portfolio composition. We believe that we are most likely to meet our investment objectives through the careful selection and underwriting of assets. When making an acquisition, we will emphasize the performance and risk characteristics of that investment, how that investment will fit with our portfolio-level performance objectives, the other assets in our portfolio and how the returns and risks of that investment compare to the returns and risks of available investment alternatives. Thus, to the extent that our advisor presents us with what we believe to be good investment opportunities that allow us to meet the REIT requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), our portfolio composition may vary from what we currently expect. In fact, we may invest in whatever types of real estate or real estate-related assets we believe are in our best interests. However, we will attempt to construct a portfolio that produces stable and attractive returns by spreading risk across different real estate investments.
We acquired our first real estate property on September 29, 2011. As of December 31, 2018, our real estate portfolio was composed of 28 office properties and one mixed-use office/retail property encompassing an aggregate of 11.2 million rentable square feet and was collectively 93% occupied. In addition, we have entered into a consolidated joint venture to develop and subsequently operate Hardware Village, which is currently under construction.
 For more information on our real estate investments, including tenant information, see Item 1, Part 2, “Properties.”

The following charts illustrate the geographic diversification of our real estate properties, excluding properties under development, based on total leased square feet and total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2018: 

_____________________
(1) Annualized base rent represents annualized contractual base rental income as of December 31, 2018, adjusted to straight-line any contractual tenant concessions (including free rent), rent increases and rent decreases from the lease’s inception through the balance of the lease term.

We have a stable tenant base and we have tried to diversify our tenant base in order to limit exposure to any one tenant or industry. Our top ten tenants leasing space in our real estate portfolio represented approximately 20% of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2018. The chart below illustrates the diversity of tenant industries in our real estate portfolio, excluding properties under development, based on total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2018:

(1) Annualized base rent represents annualized contractual base rental income as of December 31, 2018, adjusted to straight-line any contractual tenant concessions (including free rent), rent increases and rent decreases from the lease’s inception through the balance of the lease term.
* “Other” includes any industry less than 4% of total.
Financing Objectives
We financed our real estate acquisitions to date with a combination of the proceeds received from our now-terminated initial public offering and debt. We may use proceeds from borrowings to finance acquisitions of new properties or assets or for originations of new loans; to pay for capital improvements, repairs or tenant build-outs to properties; to refinance existing indebtedness; to pay distributions; or to provide working capital. Our investment strategy is to utilize primarily secured and possibly unsecured debt to finance our investment portfolio. 
We expect to continue to borrow funds at fixed and variable rates. As of December 31, 2018, we had debt obligations in the aggregate principal amount of $2.2 billion, with a weighted-average remaining term of 2.0 years. We plan to exercise our extension options available under our loan agreements or pay down or refinance the related notes payable prior to their maturity dates. We had a total of $190.5 million of fixed rate notes payable and $2.0 billion of variable rate notes payable. As of December 31, 2018, the interest rates on $1.2 billion of our variable rate notes payable were effectively fixed through interest rate swap agreements and the interest rate on $100.0 million of our variable rate debt was limited under an interest rate cap agreement that was terminated on January 1, 2019. The weighted-average interest rates of our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as of December 31, 2018 were 4.1% and 3.8%, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate represents the actual interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2018 (consisting of the contractual interest rate and the effect of interest rate swaps), using interest rate indices as of December 31, 2018, where applicable. As of December 31, 2018, we had $216.0 million of revolving debt available for immediate future disbursement under three portfolio loans, subject to certain conditions set forth in the loan agreements.

We have tried to spread the maturity dates of our debt to minimize maturity and refinance risk in our portfolio. In addition, a majority of our debt allows us to extend the maturity dates, subject to certain conditions contained in the applicable loan documents. Although we believe we will satisfy the conditions to extend the maturity of our debt obligations, we can give no assurance in this regard. The following table shows the current maturities, including principal amortization payments, of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):

2019 | $ | 348,679 
2020 | 1,171,460 | 
2021 | 294,894 | 
2022 | 256,121 | 
2023 | — | 
Thereafter | 125,000 | 
 | $ | 2,196,154

We expect that our debt financing and other liabilities will be between 45% and 65% of the cost of our tangible assets (before deducting depreciation and other non-cash reserves). There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow for the purchase of any single asset. We limit our total liabilities to 75% of the cost of our tangible assets (before deducting depreciation and other non-cash reserves) meaning that our borrowings and other liabilities may exceed our maximum target leverage of 65% of the cost of our tangible assets without violating these borrowing restrictions. We may exceed the 75% limit only if a majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of this limitation and we disclose such borrowings to our stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing. To the extent financing in excess of this limit is available on attractive terms, the conflicts committee may approve debt in excess of this limit. From time to time, our total liabilities could also be below 45% of the cost of our tangible assets due to the lack of availability of debt financing. As of December 31, 2018, our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately 62% of both the cost (before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves) and book value (before deducting depreciation) of our tangible assets, respectively. 
Economic Dependency
We are dependent on our advisor for certain services that are essential to us, including the identification, evaluation, negotiation, acquisition or origination and disposition of investments; management of the daily operations and leasing of our portfolio; and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that our advisor is unable to provide these services, we will be required to obtain such services from other sources.
Competitive Market Factors 
The U.S. commercial real estate investment and leasing markets remain competitive. We face competition from various entities for investment and disposition opportunities, for prospective tenants and to retain our current tenants, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds and companies, partnerships and developers. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant or the geographic location of their investments. Competition from these entities may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us or increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell. Further, as a result of their greater resources, those entities may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract and retain tenants. This could put pressure on our ability to maintain or raise rents and could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected.

We also face competition from many of the types of entities referenced above regarding the disposition of properties. These entities may possess properties in similar locations and/or of the same property types as ours and may be attempting to dispose of these properties at the same time we are attempting to dispose of some of our properties, providing potential purchasers with a larger number of properties from which to choose and potentially decreasing the sales price for such properties. Additionally, these entities may be willing to accept a lower return on their individual investments, which could further reduce the sales price of such properties. This competition could decrease the sales proceeds we receive for properties that we sell, assuming we are able to sell such properties, which could adversely affect our cash flows and the overall return for our stockholders.
Although we believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively in each facet of our business, there is enormous competition in our market sector and there can be no assurance that we will compete effectively or that we will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit our ability to conduct our business effectively.
Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Law
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous real property owner or operator may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These costs could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental laws also may impose liens on property or restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us from entering into leases with prospective tenants that may be impacted by such laws. Environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Third parties may seek recovery from real property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances and governments may seek recovery for natural resource damage. The costs of defending against claims of environmental liability, of complying with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury, property damage or natural resource damage claims could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. All of our real estate properties are subject to Phase I environmental assessments prior to the time they are acquired.
Industry Segments
We invested in core real estate properties and real estate-related investments with the goal of acquiring a portfolio of income-producing investments. Our real estate properties exhibit similar long-term financial performance and have similar economic characteristics to each other. As of December 31, 2018, we aggregated our investments in real estate properties into one reportable business segment.
Employees
We have no paid employees. The employees of our advisor or its affiliates provide management, acquisition, disposition, advisory and certain administrative services for us.
