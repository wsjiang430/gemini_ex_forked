ITEM 1.                  BUSINESS
Overview
 
Our principal business is to develop, own, operate, support and manage chiropractic clinics through direct ownership, management arrangements, franchising and the sale of regional developer rights throughout the United States.
 
We are a rapidly growing franchisor and operator of chiropractic clinics that uses a private pay, non-insurance, cash-based model. We seek to be the leading provider of chiropractic care in the markets we serve and to become the most recognized brand in our industry through the rapid and focused expansion of chiropractic clinics in key markets throughout North America and abroad. We strive to accomplish our mission by making quality care readily available and affordable in a retail setting. We have created a growing network of modern, consumer-friendly chiropractic clinics operated by franchisees and by us that employ licensed chiropractors. Our model enables us to price our services below most competitors’ pricing for similar services and below most insurance co-payment levels (i.e., below the patient co-payment required for an insurance-covered service). 
 
Since acquiring the predecessor to our company in March 2010, we have grown our enterprise from eight to 442 clinics in operation as of December 31, 2018, with an additional 136 franchise licenses sold but not yet developed across our network, and 19 letters-of-intent for future clinic licenses. As of December 31, 2018, 394 of our clinics were operated by franchisees and 48 clinics were operated as company-owned or managed clinics. In the year ended December 31, 2018, our system registered over six million patient visits and generated system-wide sales of $165.1 million. Our future growth strategy remains focused on accelerating the development of our franchise base through the sale of additional franchises and through a robust regional developer network. Additionally, this year we plan to accelerate the expansion of our company-owned or managed portfolio through the continued opportunistic acquisition of select operating clinics or the development of new clinics in areas in which we already support company-owned or managed clinics. We collect a royalty of 7.0% of revenues from franchised clinics. We remit a 3.0% royalty to our regional developers on the gross sales of franchises opened within certain regional developer protected territories. We also collect a national marketing fee of 2.0% of gross sales of all franchised clinics. We receive a franchise sales fee of $39,900 for each franchise we sell directly. For each franchise sold through our network of regional developers, the regional developer typically receives up to 50% of the respective franchise fee. If a franchisee purchases additional franchise licenses, the initial franchise fee is reduced by $10,000 per additional license.
 
On November 14, 2014, we completed our initial public offering, or the IPO, of 3,000,000 shares of common stock at an initial price to the public of $6.50 per share, and we received net proceeds of approximately $17.1 million. Our underwriters exercised their option to purchase 450,000 additional shares of common stock to cover over-allotments on November 18, 2014, pursuant to which we received net proceeds of approximately $2.7 million. Also, in conjunction with the IPO, we issued warrants to the underwriters for the purchase of 90,000 shares of common stock, which were exercisable during the period between November 10, 2015 and November 10, 2018 at an exercise price of $8.125 per share. These warrants expired on November 10, 2018.
 
On November 25, 2015, we closed on our follow-on public offering of 2,272,727 shares of common stock, at a price to the public of $5.50 per share. We granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 340,909 additional shares of common stock to cover over-allotments, if any. On December 30, 2015, our underwriters exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 340,909 shares of common stock at a price of $5.50 per share. After giving effect to the over-allotment exercise, the total number of shares offered and sold in our follow-on public offering increased to 2,613,636 shares. With the over-allotment option exercise, we received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $13.0 million.
 
We deliver convenient, appointment-free chiropractic adjustments in an inviting, open bay environment at prices that are approximately 65% lower than the average industry cost for comparable procedures offered by traditional chiropractors, according to 2018 industry data from Chiropractic Economics. In support of our mission to offer quality, affordable and convenient care to our patients, our clinics offer a variety of customizable membership and wellness treatment plans which provide additional value pricing even as compared with our single-visit pricing schedules. These flexible plans are designed to attract patients and encourage repeat visits and routine usage as part of an overall health and wellness program.

As of December 31, 2018, we had 442 franchised or company-owned or managed clinics in operation in 32 states. The map below shows the states in which we or our franchisees operate clinics and the number of clinics open in each state as of December 31, 2018.
 


Our retail locations have been selected to be visible, accessible and convenient. We offer a welcoming, consumer-friendly experience that attempts to redefine the chiropractic doctor/patient relationship. Our clinics are open longer hours than many of our competitors, including weekend days, and our patients do not need appointments. We accept cash or major credit cards in return for our services. We do not accept insurance and do not provide Medicare covered services. We believe that our approach, especially our commitment to affordable pricing and our ready service delivery model, will attract existing consumers of chiropractic services and will also appeal to the growing market of consumers who seek alternative or non-invasive wellness care, but have not yet tried chiropractic. According to our patient survey conducted in early 2019 by WestGroup Research, 26% of our new patients had never tried chiropractic care before they came to The Joint. This represents an increase from 22% of patients new to chiropractic in the same survey conducted in 2017, 16% in 2015 and 13% in 2013, demonstrating our continued impact on the chiropractic market and offering validation to our thesis that we are actually expanding the overall market for chiropractic.
 
Our patients arrive at our clinics without appointments at times convenient to their schedules. Once a patient has joined our system and is returning for treatment, they simply swipe their membership card at a card reader at the reception desk to announce their arrival. The patient is then escorted to our open adjustment area, where they are required to remove only their outerwear to receive their adjustment. Each patient’s records are digitally updated for retrieval in our proprietary data storage system by our chiropractors in compliance with all applicable medical records security and privacy regulations. The adjustment process, administered by a licensed chiropractor, takes approximately 15 –20 minutes on average for a new patient and 5 – 7 minutes on average for a returning patient. 
 
Our consumer-focused service model targets the non-acute treatment market, which is part of the $15 billion chiropractic services market, according to IBIS market research report in February 2019. As our model does not focus on the treatment of severe or acute injury, we do not provide expensive and invasive diagnostic tools such as MRIs and X-rays. Instead we refer those with severe or acute symptoms to alternate healthcare providers, including traditional chiropractors. 
 
Our Industry
 
Chiropractic care is widely accepted among individuals with a variety of medical conditions, particularly back pain. It is estimated that chiropractors treat more than 35 million Americans (adults and children) annually. A 2018 Gallup report commissioned by Palmer College of Chiropractic shows that among all U.S. adults, including those who did not have neck or back pain, 16% went to a chiropractor in the last 12 months. These numbers represent a marked increase over the 2012 National Health Interview Survey that measured chiropractic use at 8% of the population. According to the American Chiropractic Association, 80% of Americans experience back pain at least once in their lifetime. According to the same 2018 Gallup report commissioned by the Palmer College of Chiropractic, eight in 10 adults in the United States (80%) prefer to see a health care professional who is an expert in spine-related conditions for neck or back pain care instead of a general medicine professional who treats a variety of conditions (15%).

Chiropractic care is increasingly recognized as an effective treatment for pain and potentially for a variety of other conditions. The American College of Physicians (ACP) now recommends non-drug therapy such as spinal manipulation as a first line of treatment for patients with chronic low-back pain. The ACP states that treatments such as spinal manipulation are shown to improve symptoms with little risk of harm. The National Center for Complementary & Alternative Medicine of the National Institutes of Health has stated that spinal manipulation appears to benefit some people with low-back pain and also may be helpful for headaches, neck pain, upper- and lower-extremity joint conditions and whiplash-associated disorders. The Mayo Clinic has recognized chiropractic as safe when performed by trained and licensed chiropractors, and the Cleveland Clinic has stated that chiropractors are established members of the mainstream medical team.
 
The chiropractic industry in the United States is large and highly fragmented. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that $90 billion is spent on back pain each year in the U.S. According to a report issued by IBIS World Chiropractors Market Research in February 2019, expenditures for chiropractic services in the U.S. are $15.0 billion annually. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics expects employment in chiropractic to grow faster than the average for all occupations. Some of the factors that the Bureau of Labor Statistics identified as driving this growth are healthcare cost pressures, an aging population requiring more health care and technological advances, all of which are expected to increasingly shift services from inpatient facilities and hospitals to outpatient settings. We believe that the demand for our chiropractic services will continue to grow as a result of several additional drivers, such as the growing recognition of the benefits of regular maintenance therapy coupled with an increasing awareness of the convenience of our service and of our pricing at a significant discount to the cost of traditional chiropractic adjustments and, in most cases, at or below the level of insurance co-payment amounts.
 
Today, most chiropractic services are provided by sole practitioners, generally in medical office settings. The chiropractic industry differs from the broader healthcare services industry in that it is more heavily consumer-driven, market-responsive and price sensitive, in large measure a result of many treatment options falling outside the bounds of traditional insurance reimbursable services and fee schedules. According to a First Research report from November 2018, the top 50 companies delivering chiropractic services in the United States generated less than 10% of all industry revenue. We believe these characteristics are evidence of an underserved market with potential consumer demand that is favorable for an efficient, low-cost, consumer-oriented provider.
 
Most chiropractic practices are set up to accept and to process insurance-based reimbursement. While chiropractors typically accept cash payment in addition to insurance, Medicare and Medicaid, they continue to incur overhead expenses associated with maintaining the capability to process third-party reimbursement. We believe that most chiropractors who use this third-party reimbursement model would find it economically difficult to discount the prices they charge for their services to levels comparable with our pricing.
 
Accordingly, we believe these and certain other trends favor our business model. Among these are:
 

• | People, most notably Millennials – the largest portion of our patient base – have increasingly active lifestyles and are living longer, requiring more medical, maintenance and preventative support;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | People are increasingly open to alternative, non-pharmacological types of care; 
• | Utilization of more conveniently situated, local-sited urgent-care or “mini-care” alternatives to primary care is increasing; and 
• | Popularity of health clubs, massage and other non-drug, non-invasive wellness maintenance providers is growing. 

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe the following competitive strengths have contributed to our initial success and will position us for future growth:
 
Retail, consumer-driven approach.  To support our consumer-focused model, we use strong, recognizable retail approaches to stimulate brand-awareness and attract patients to our clinics. We intend to continue to drive awareness of our brand by locating clinics mainly at retail centers and convenience points, displaying prominent signage and employing consistent, proven and targeted marketing tools. We offer our patients the flexibility to visit our clinics without an appointment and receive prompt attention. Additionally, most of our clinics offer extended hours of operation, including weekends, which is not typical among our competitors.
 
We attracted an average of 1,041 new patients per clinic (for all clinics open for the full twelve months of 2018) during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the 2018 chiropractic industry average of 359 new patients per year for traditional insurance-based non-multidisciplinary or integrated practices, according to a 2018 Chiropractic Economics survey.

Quality, Empathetic Service.  Across our system we have a community of approximately 1,200 fully licensed chiropractic doctors, who performed over six million adjustments last year alone. Our doctors provide personal and intuitive patient care focused on pain relief and ongoing wellness to promote healthy, active lifestyles. We provide our doctors one-on-one training, as well as ongoing coaching and mentoring. Our doctors continually refine their skills, as our clinics see an average of 279 patient visits per week (for clinics open for the full twelve months of 2018), as compared to the 2018 chiropractic industry average of 138 patients per week for non-multidisciplinary or integrated practices, according to a 2018 Chiropractic Economics survey. Our service offerings encourage consumer trial, repeat visits and sustainable patient relationships.
 
By limiting the administrative burdens of insurance processing, our model helps chiropractors focus on patient service. We believe the time our chiropractors save by not having to perform administrative duties related to insurance reimbursement allows more time to see more patients, establish and reinforce chiropractor/patient relationships, and educate patients on the benefits of chiropractic maintenance therapy.
 
Our approach has made us an attractive alternative for chiropractic doctors who want to spend more time treating patients than they typically do in traditional practices, which are burdened with greater overhead, personnel and administrative expense. We believe that our model helps us to recruit chiropractors who want to focus their practice principally on patient care.
 
Accessibility.  We believe that our strongest competitive advantages are our convenience and affordability. By focusing on non-acute care in an open-bay environment and by not participating in insurance or Medicare reimbursement, we are able to offer a much less expensive alternative to traditional chiropractic services. We can do this because our clinics do not have the expenses of performing certain diagnostic procedures and processing reimbursement claims. Our model allows us to pass these savings on to our patients. According to Chiropractic Economics in 2018, the average fee for a chiropractic treatment involving spinal manipulation in a cash-based practice in the United States is approximately $77. By comparison, our average fee as of December 31, 2018 was approximately $27, approximately 65% lower than the industry average price.
 
We believe our pricing and service offering structure helps us to generate higher usage. The following table sets forth our average price per adjustment as of December 31, 2018 for patients who pay by single adjustment plans, multiple adjustment packages, and multiple adjustment membership plans. Our price per adjustment as of December 31, 2018 averaged approximately $27 across all three groups.

 | Single Visit | | Package(s) | Membership(s)
Price per adjustment | $ | 39 | | | $20 – $33 | $15 – $20

 
Proven track record of opening clinics and growing revenue at the clinic level.  We have grown our clinic revenue base consistently. From January 2012 through December 31, 2018, we have increased average monthly sales across our clinics from $0.4 million to $13.8 million. During this period, we increased the number of clinics in operation from 33 to 442.
 
We continue to be encouraged by the ability of individual clinics to generate growth. While there is significant variation in results in our system, and the results of our top-performing clinics are not representative of our system overall, we believe it is worth noting that in January 2012, the highest-performing clinic in our system was a franchise clinic which had monthly sales of approximately $45,000, and in December 2018, the highest performing clinic in our system was a franchise clinic which had monthly sales of approximately $119,000.
 
Strong and proven management team.  Our strategic vision is directed by our president and chief executive officer, Peter D. Holt, who has more than 30 years of experience in domestic and international franchising, franchise development and operations. Under his direction we have confirmed our commitment to the continued strengthening of operations, the continued cultivation and management of our franchise community, as well as a strong commitment to future clinic development both domestically and internationally. Mr. Holt was most recently president and chief executive officer of Tasti-D-Lite & Planet Smoothie. He has also served as chief operating officer of 24seven Vending (U.S), where he directed its franchise system in the U.S., and as executive vice president of development for Mail Boxes Etc. and vice president of international for I Can’t Believe It’s Yogurt and Java Coast Fine Coffees. Mr. Holt directs a team of dedicated leaders who are focused on executing our business plan and implementing our growth strategy.
 
Mr. Holt has assembled a strong management team including Jake Singleton as chief financial officer. In addition to valuable institutional memory from his over three years serving as our corporate controller, Mr. Singleton has financial and accounting experience from his time with the public accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP.

In 2016, Eric Simon joined as vice president of franchise sales and development with over 20 years of experience in all aspects of franchising, most recently as director of franchise development for AAMCO Transmissions. Mr. Simon spent five years as a franchisee and area developer with Extreme Pita and previously spent 10 years with Mail Boxes Etc. in franchise sales roles.
 
In 2017, Jorge Armenteros joined as vice president of operations bringing with him more than 30 years of franchise operations leadership experience. For 10 years prior to joining the team, Mr. Armenteros was the executive senior vice president of franchise operations and corporate development for Campero USA, a fast food restaurant chain. Prior to that, he was founder and chief executive officer of Tri-Brands Management Group, which operated franchised Dunkin’ Donuts, Baskin Robbins and Togo restaurants, and was vice president of operations at Dunkin’ Brands. His career also includes a period as a multi-unit franchisee of Dunkin’ Donuts.
 
Amy Karroum was promoted to vice president of human resources in 2017, having joined us in 2015. Prior to working at The Joint, Ms. Karroum was director of human resources for Thermo Fluids, an oil recycling company, and before that, she spent five years in homebuilding with both Taylor Morrison and Pulte Homes.
 
In 2018, Jason Greenwood joined our management team as vice president of marketing. Mr. Greenwood spent the last 10 years at Peter Piper Pizza in progressively responsible roles, most recently as chief marketing officer. Prior to that, he was a multi-unit franchisee for Robeks Juice.
 
Also in 2018, Manjula Sriram joined our management team as vice president of information technology. Prior to working at The Joint, Ms. Sriram spent the last three years at Early Warning Services in progressively responsible roles, most recently as director of customer implementation and support. Prior to that, she performed various senior technical and project management roles at Vail Systems, Inc, US Foods, Walgreens and United Airlines.
 
 We believe that our management team’s experience and demonstrated success in building and operating a robust franchise system will be a key driver of our growth and will position us well for achieving our long-term strategy. 
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
Our goal is not only to capture a significant share of the existing market but also to expand the market for chiropractic care. We are accomplishing this through the rapid geographic expansion of our affordable franchising program and the opportunistic addition of company-owned or managed clinics. Accordingly, our long-term growth tactics include:

• | the continued growth of system sales and royalty income; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | accelerating the opening of clinics already in development; 
• | the sale of additional franchises; 
• | the sale of additional regional developer protected territories; 
• | increasing the capability and capacity of our existing regional developer network; 
• | improving operational margins and leveraging infrastructure; 
• | the opportunistic acquisition of existing franchises – referred to as “buybacks”; and 
• | the development of company-owned clinics – referred to as “greenfields” – in clustered geographies.

 
 Our analysis of data from over 557,000 patient records from 427 clinics across 31 states suggests that the United States market alone can support at least 1,700 of our clinics.

Continued growth of system sales. 
 
System wide comparable same-store sales growth, or “Comp Sales,” for 2018 was 25.2%, reflecting the growing acceptance of The Joint business model. Comp Sales refers to the amount of sales a clinic generates in the most recent accounting period, compared to the amount of sales it generated in a similar period in the past. Comp Sales include the sales from both company-owned or managed clinics and franchised clinics that in each case have been open at least 13 full months and exclude any clinics that have closed. We believe that the experience we have gained in developing and refining management systems, operating standards, training materials and marketing and customer acquisition activities has contributed to our system’s revenue growth. In addition, we believe that increasing awareness of our brand has contributed to revenue growth, particularly in markets where the number and density of our clinics has made cooperative and mass media advertising attractive. We believe that our ability to leverage aggregated and general media digital advertising and search tools will continue to grow as the number and density of our clinics increases. 
  
Selling additional franchises. 
 
We will continue to sell franchises. We believe that to secure leadership in our industry and to maximize our opportunities in our markets, it is important to gain brand equity and consumer awareness as rapidly as possible, consistent with a disciplined approach to opening clinics. We believe that continued sales of franchises in selected markets is the most effective way to drive brand awareness in the short term. As discussed below, consistent with our longer-term strategy, we have resumed the opening or acquiring of company-owned or managed clinics, and we believe that a growth strategy that includes both franchised and company-owned or managed clinics has advantages over either approach by itself.
 
Selling additional Regional Developer rights. 
 
We believe that we can achieve scale faster by using a regional developer model, which is employed by many successful franchisors. We sell a regional developer the rights to open a minimum number of clinics in a defined territory. They in turn help us to identify and qualify potential new franchisees in that territory and assist us in providing field training, clinic openings and ongoing support. In return, we share part of the initial franchise fee and pay the regional developer 3% of the 7% ongoing royalties we collect from the franchisees in their protected territory. In 2017, we sold the rights to an additional 10 regional developer territories for a combined minimum development commitment of 270 clinics over the lifetime of their regional developer agreements. In 2018, we sold the rights to an additional four regional developer territories for a combined minimum development commitment of 111 clinics over the lifetime of their regional developer agreements. In 2018, regional developers were responsible for 89% of the 99 franchise license sales for the year. This growth reflects the power of the regional developer program to accelerate the number of clinics opening across the country.

Opening clinics in development. 
 
In addition to our 442 operating clinics, as of December 31, 2018, we have granted franchises, either directly or through our regional developers, for an additional 136 clinics that we believe will be developed in the future and executed 19 letters-of-intent for future clinic licenses. We will continue to support our franchisees and regional developers to open these clinics and to achieve sustainable performance as rapidly as possible.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we terminated four franchise licenses for undeveloped clinics that were in default.
 
Continue to improve margins and leverage infrastructure. 
 
We believe our corporate infrastructure can support a clinic base greater than our existing footprint. As we continue to grow, we expect to drive greater efficiencies across our operations, development and marketing programs and further leverage our technology and existing support infrastructure. We believe we will be able to control corporate costs over time to enhance margins as general and administrative expenses grow at a slower rate than our clinic base and sales. At the clinic level, we expect to drive margins and labor efficiencies through continued sales growth and consistently applied operating standards as our clinic base matures and the average number of patient visits increases. In addition, we will consider introducing selected and complementary branded products such as nutraceuticals or dietary supplements and related additional services.
 
Acquiring existing franchises. 
 
We believe that we can accelerate the development of, and revenue generation from, company-owned or managed clinics through the further selective acquisition of existing franchised clinics. We will pursue the acquisition of existing franchised clinics that meet our criteria for demographics, site attractiveness, proximity to other clinics and additional suitability factors. Following the completion of the IPO through December 31, 2018, we acquired 35 existing franchises, subsequently closed three, and continue to operate 32 of them as company-owned or managed clinics.
 
Development of company-owned or managed clinics. 
 
We acquired our first company-owned or managed clinic on December 31, 2014. In the first full calendar quarter after that acquisition, total revenue from company-owned or managed clinics was $0.4 million, growing to approximately $4.3 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Total revenue from our 48 company-owned or managed clinics was approximately $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $11.1 million from 47 company-owned or managed clinics for the year ended December 31, 2017. Through December 31, 2018, revenue from company-owned or managed clinics consisted of revenue earned from 32 franchised clinics that we acquired, as well as 16 clinics that we developed.
 
We resumed the development of company-owned or managed clinics in the first quarter of 2019. As of March 1, 2019, we opened two greenfield units, executed two leases for future greenfield clinic locations, and had nine additional letters-of-intent in place for further greenfield expansion. Consistent with our strategies discussed above, we intend to target geographic clusters where we are able to increase efficiencies through a consolidated real estate penetration strategy, leverage cooperative advertisement and marketing, and attain general corporate and administrative operating efficiencies. We also believe that the development timeline and point of break-even for company-owned or managed clinics will be shortened as compared to our previous greenfield openings and that our revenue from company-owned or managed clinics will ultimately exceed revenue that would be generated through royalty income from a franchise-only system.
 
Regulatory Environment
 
HIPAA 
 
In an effort to further combat healthcare fraud and protect patient confidentiality, Congress included several anti-fraud measures in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA created a source of funding for fraud control to coordinate federal, state and local healthcare law enforcement programs, conduct investigations, provide guidance to the healthcare industry concerning fraudulent healthcare practices, and establish a national data bank to receive and report final adverse actions. HIPAA also criminalized certain forms of healthcare fraud against all public and private payors. Additionally, HIPAA mandates the adoption of standards regarding the exchange of healthcare information in an effort to ensure the privacy and security of electronic patient information. Sanctions for failing to comply with HIPAA include criminal penalties and civil sanctions. In February 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was enacted. Title XIII of ARRA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), includes substantial Medicare and Medicaid incentives for providers to adopt electronic health records (“EHR”) and grants for the development of health information exchange (“HIE”) systems. Recognizing that HIE and EHR systems will not be implemented unless the public can be assured that the privacy and security of patient information in such systems is protected, HITECH also significantly expands the scope of the privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Most notable are the new mandatory breach notification requirements and a heightened enforcement scheme that includes increased penalties, and which now apply to business associates as well as to covered entities. In addition to HIPAA, a number of states have adopted laws and/or regulations applicable in the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information that can be more stringent than comparable provisions under HIPAA and HITECH.

We believe that our operations substantially comply with applicable standards for privacy and security of protected healthcare information. We cannot predict what negative effect, if any, HIPAA/HITECH or any applicable state law or regulation will have on our business.
    State regulations on corporate practice of chiropractic. 
 
In states that regulate the “corporate practice of chiropractic,” chiropractic services are provided solely by legal entities organized under state laws as professional corporations, or PCs or their equivalents. Each of the PCs is wholly owned by one or more licensed chiropractors and employs or contracts with chiropractors in one or more offices. We do not own any capital stock of (or have any other ownership interest in) any such PC. We and our franchisees that are not owned by chiropractors enter into management services agreements with PCs to provide the PCs on an exclusive basis with all non-clinical administrative services needed by the chiropractic practice.
 
In February 2019, a bill was introduced in the Arkansas state legislature prohibiting the ownership and management of a chiropractic corporation by a non-chiropractor. While it is questionable whether the proposed prohibition would be applicable to our business model in Arkansas, the bill could be interpreted to challenge that model if passed in its current form. In November 2018, the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners adopted changes to its rules to prohibit a chiropractor from owning or operating a chiropractic practice as a surrogate for a non-chiropractor. As in the case of the proposed Arkansas bill, the rules changes could be interpreted to challenge our business model in Oregon, although it is similarly questionable whether the prohibition would be applicable. Previously in 2018, the Oregon Board exchanged correspondence with us requesting clarification of our business model and separately with one of our franchisees alleging a violation of the rules against the corporate practice of chiropractic. We provided the requested clarification in March 2018, and the Oregon Board has not taken any additional action to date. After a further exchange of correspondence with the franchisee, the Oregon Board notified the franchisee in August 2018 that the case was closed.
 
In November 2015, the California Board of Chiropractic Examiners commenced an administrative proceeding to which we were not a party, in which it claimed that the doctor who owns the PC that we manage in southern California violated California’s prohibition on the corporate practice of chiropractic, among other claims, because our management of the clinics operated by his PC involved the exercise of control over certain clinical aspects of his practice. The California Board of Chiropractic Examiners subsequently dismissed those claims in congruence with findings of the overseeing administrative judge. In June 2015, the New York Attorney General announced that it had entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance with a provider of business services to independently owned dental practices in New York, pursuant to which the provider paid a substantial fine and agreed to change its business and branding practices.
 
While the effect of the Arkansas bill if passed, the Oregon rules changes, the proceeding before the California Board of Chiropractic Examiners and the New York Assurance of Discontinuance may be that our business practices in those states are under stricter scrutiny than elsewhere, we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws relating to the corporate practice of chiropractic.
 
Please see the risk factor in Item 1A beginning with the phrase “Our management services agreements” for a more detailed discussion of state regulations on the “corporate practice of chiropractic” as they relate to our business model.
 
Regulation relating to franchising 
 
We are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The Federal Trade Commission and various state laws require that we furnish a Franchise Disclosure Document or FDD containing certain information to prospective franchisees, and a number of states require registration of the FDD at least annually with state authorities. Included in the information required to be disclosed in our FDD is our business experience, material litigation, all fees due to us from franchisees, a franchisee’s estimated initial investment, restrictions on sources of products and services we impose on franchisees, development and operating obligations of franchisees, whether we provide financing to franchisees, our training and support obligations and other terms and conditions of our franchise agreement. We are operating under exemptions from registration in several states based on our qualifications for exemption as set forth in those states’ laws. Substantive state laws regulating the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in many states. We believe that our FDD and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with both the Federal Trade Commission guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises. As of December 31, 2018, we were registered to sell franchises in every state (where registrations are required); and could sell franchises in all 50 states.

Other federal, state and local regulation 
 
We are subject to varied federal regulations affecting the operation of our business. We are subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, overtime, fringe benefits, workplace safety and other working conditions and citizenship requirements. A significant number of our clinic service personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage and increases in the minimum wage could increase our labor costs. We are continuing to assess the impact of recently-adopted federal health care legislation on our health care benefit costs. Many of our smaller franchisees will qualify for exemption from the mandatory requirement to provide health insurance benefits because of their small number of employees. The imposition of any requirement that we or our franchisees provide health insurance benefits to our or their employees that are more extensive than the health insurance benefits that we currently provide to our employees or that franchisees may or may not provide, or the imposition of additional employer paid employment taxes on income earned by our employees, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Our distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us.
 
In an August 2015 decision, the National Labor Relations Board (or “NLRB”) adopted a more expansive definition of “joint employer” in the case of Browning-Ferris Industries, making it easier for employees of franchisees to organize and bargain collectively. The Browning-Ferris decision, as well as a July 2014 NLRB action holding that McDonald’s Corporation could be held jointly liable for labor and wage violations by its franchisees, also made it easier for a franchisor to be held responsible as an employer for a franchisee’s misconduct. In December 2017, the NLRB reversed itself and expressly reinstated a narrower definition of “joint employer,” an action we believed would be more favorable to us by making it less likely that we would be held accountable for the actions of our franchisees. In February 2018, the NLRB’s action in reverting to the narrower (and thus more favorable to us) definition of “joint employer” was vacated, due to a conflict of interest on the part of one of the NLRB’s commissioners. While this action was taken more on procedural than on policy grounds, it effectively revived the NLRB’s expansive definition of “joint employer” adopted in its 2015 Browning-Ferris ruling. In September 2018, the NLRB issued and solicited comments on a proposed rule to reinstate the narrower (and more favorable to us) pre-Browning Ferris definition of “joint employer.” However, in January 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit partially upheld the 2015 Browning-Ferris expansive definition, thereby bringing into question whether the NLRB’s proposed rules would survive in their current form or could withstand judicial scrutiny if not revised to take into account the D.C. Circuit’s holding. Earlier, in a July 2018 ruling which has been appealed to the NLRB, an administrative law judge rejected a proposed settlement in the 2014 McDonald’s Corporation action, which settlement would have allowed McDonald’s to avoid a ruling that it is a “joint employer” of a franchisee’s employees.
 
We are required to comply with the accessibility standards mandated by the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and related federal and state statutes, which generally prohibit discrimination in accommodation or employment based on disability. We may, in the future, have to modify our clinics to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. While these expenses could be material, our current expectation is that any such actions will not require us to expend substantial funds.
 
We are subject to extensive and varied state and local government regulation affecting the operation of our business, as are our franchisees, including regulations relating to public and occupational health and safety, sanitation, fire prevention and franchise operation. Each franchised clinic is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include zoning, health, safety, sanitation, environmental, building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the clinic is located. We require our franchisees to operate in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable codes and regulations. However, our or our franchisees’ inability to obtain or retain health or other licenses would adversely affect operations at the impacted clinic or clinics. Although we have not experienced and do not anticipate any significant difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining required licenses, permits or approvals, any such problem could delay or prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, a particular clinic. In addition, in order to develop and construct our clinics, we need to comply with applicable zoning and land use regulations. Federal and state regulations have not had a material effect on our operations to date, but more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning and land use could delay or even prevent construction and increase development costs of new clinics. 
 
Competition
 
The chiropractic industry is highly fragmented. According to First Research’s 2018 report, the top 50 providers of chiropractic services in the United States generate less than 10% of industry revenue. Our competitors include approximately 39,000 independent chiropractic offices currently open throughout the United States, according to a 2017 Kentley Insights market research report, as well as certain multi-unit operators. We may also face competition from traditional medical practices, outpatient clinics, physical therapists, med-spas, massage therapists and sellers of devices intended for home use to address back and joint discomfort. Our three largest multi-unit competitors are HealthSource Chiropractic, AlignLife Chiropractic & Natural Health Centers and ChiroOne Wellness Centers, all of which are insurance-based models.
 
We have identified four competitors who are attempting to duplicate our cash-only, low cost, appointment-free model. Based on publicly available information, these competitors each operate fewer than ten clinics as franchises. We anticipate that other direct competitors will join our industry as our visibility, reputation and perceived advantages become more widely known. We believe our first mover advantage, proprietary operations systems, and strong unit level economics will continue to accelerate our growth even with the spawning of additional competition.
