Item 1. Business Overview



authID Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “authID”, “we” or “our”) is a leading provider of secure, authentication solutions delivered by our easy to integrate VerifiedTM platform. Our Verified platform delivers Human Factor AuthenticationTM (“HFA”) that binds strong passwordless authentication with biometric identity, which offers our customers a streamlined path to zero trust architecture. Verified FIDO2 passwordless authentication is certified by the FIDO Alliance to be compliant and interoperable with FIDO specifications. 



The explosive growth in online and mobile commerce, telemedicine, remote working and digital activities of all descriptions is self-evident to everyone who lived through the Covid 19 pandemic since 2020. Yet this has been coupled with a rampant rise in identity theft, phishing attacks, spear-phishing, password vulnerabilities, account takeovers and benefits fraud. Cyberattacks that are the result of compromised credentials are significant impediments to the operations and growth of any business or organization, and dealing with the risks and consequences of these criminal activities has created significant friction in time, cost and lost opportunity. Consider all the outdated methods that organizations have implemented in order to prevent fraud. The requests to receive and enter one-time passwords, that can be easily hijacked. The vulnerable security questions you get asked – whether on-line or when reaching out to a call center – what was your first pet’s name? who was your best friend in high school? These steps all add up to friction, making it difficult for consumers to login, transact and execute daily tasks, with little added protection from fraud. Surely there is a better way to address these challenges. authID believes there is.



authID provides secure, biometric, identity verification, and strong passwordless and biometric authentication for both consumer and workforce applications. We maintain our globally accessible, cloud-based Verified platform for our enterprise customers to enable their users to easily verify and authenticate their identity through a mobile device or desktop, without requiring dedicated hardware, or authentication apps. We can help our customers establish a proven identity, creating a root of trust that ensures the highest level of assurance for our phishing resistant, passwordless login and step-up authentication products. Our patented technology enables participants to consent to transactions using their biometric information with a digitally signed authentication response, embedding the underlying transaction data and each user’s identity attributes within every electronic transaction message processed through our platform.



Digital transformation across all market segments requires trusted identity. Our Verified platform offers innovative solutions that are flexible, fast and easy to integrate and offer seamless user experiences. authID’s products help advance digital transformation efforts without the fear of identity fraud, while delivering frictionless user experiences. We believe that it is also essential that electronic transactions have an audit trail, proving that the identity of the individual was duly authenticated. Our platform provides biometric and multi-factor identity software, which are intended to establish, authenticate and verify identity across a wide range of use cases and electronic transactions.



authID’s products focus on the broad requirement for enabling frictionless commerce by allowing an entity to instantly “Recognise Your Customer” or employees. Organizations of all descriptions require cost-effective and secure means of growing their business while mitigating identity fraud. We aim to offer our enterprise customers products that can be integrated easily into each of their business and organizational operations, in order to facilitate their adoption and enhance the end user customer or employee experience.



Our management believes that some of the advantages of our Verified Platform approach are the ability to leverage the platform to support a variety of vertical markets and the adaptability of the platform to the requirements of new markets and new products. Verified is a cost-effective, secure, and configurable mobile solution. Our target markets include banking, fintech, healthcare and other disrupters of traditional commerce, small and medium sized businesses, and system integrators working with government and Fortune 1000 enterprises. At its core, the Company’s offering, combining its proprietary and acquired biometric and artificial intelligence technologies (or AI), is intended to facilitate frictionless commerce, whether in the physical or digital world. The Company intends to continue its investment in developing, patenting and acquiring the various elements necessary to enhance the platform, including our use of artificial intelligence in proprietary software, which are intended to allow us to achieve our goals.



authID is dedicated to developing advanced methods of protecting consumer privacy and deploying ethical and socially responsible AI. We believe that a proactive commitment to ethical AI presents a strong business opportunity for authID and will enable us to bring more accurate products to market more quickly and with less risk to better serve our global user base. Our methods to achieve ethical AI include engaging the users of our products with informed consent, prioritizing the security of our user’s personal information, considering and avoiding potential bias in our algorithms, and monitoring of algorithm performance in our applications.

Global Market Opportunity



The drive towards digital transformation since 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the rampant growth in fraud that exploits human vulnerability have contributed significantly to several market trends driving growth and demand for stronger, more secure identity verification and authentication solutions and services such as those authID provides. The accelerated pace of digital transformation at the enterprise level has been driven largely by the increased demands for online goods and sharing-economy services by consumers. The shift to working from home, and the remote IT challenges this lifestyle change presents is also driving opportunities for strong workforce identity and application access authentication. Today, even as more companies started return to work in the office, data show that millions of workers will continue to work remotely and hybrid, a long-term shift that will require enhanced security across many industry sectors.



Unfortunately, the increase in remote work and digital, non-face-to-face commerce has also resulted in increased fraud, phishing scams and cyber security risks. These trends, as well as increased regulation mandates by governments, whether Federal, State, local or international, are key drivers of the need for improved processes to verify and authenticate identities.



Digital Transformation



Digital transformation, or the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business, is fundamentally changing how organizations operate and deliver value to customers. The global disruption of the last two years dramatically increased the need for organizations to be more agile to meet changing markets, evolving technology and consumer demands. According to IBM research, more than 60% of surveyed executives are using this period of change to rapidly advance their enterprise’s transformation (IBM Institute for Business Value “Digital Transformation Report” 2021). A McKinsey Global Survey of executives found that companies have accelerated the digitization of their customer and supply-chain interactions and of their internal operations by three to four years (McKinsey, October 2020). According to Statista, spending on digital transformation will grow from $1.8 trillion in 2022 to $3.4 trillion by 2026. Statista also forecasts that as much as 65% of the world’s gross domestic product will be digitalized by 2022 (Statista “Spending on digital transformation technologies and services worldwide from 2017 to 2026” Nov, 2022).



Digital and mobile technologies have significantly changed people’s lives in a remarkably short time, including how we work, shop, socialize and bank. Escalating increases in mobile application downloads for digital goods and services by even the most reluctant consumers, dramatically altered service delivery across broad market segments, creating lasting effects that we believe are likely to stay.



Enterprises that were able to, scrambled to reduce reliance on physical outlets and to drive customers to remote digital channels offering seamless and secure user experiences. Electronic services—from mobile banking to online grocery shopping to tele-medicine—have increased multifold since 2020.



The Increase in Identity Fraud and Social Engineering Attacks



The increased demand for online services, remote working and digital convenience, has created another challenge for organizations– the need to improve cybersecurity measures. We believe that criminals have never been more active in using stolen data or credential-stuffing attacks in attempts to infiltrate corporate networks.



Today, legacy methods of authenticating identity online including passwords and one-time pin codes, or knowledge-based questions no longer create a safe digital world. Nearly every day, we read about significant data breaches at large organizations including Twilio, Cisco, Intuit, and recently PayPal. All of them have one thing in common. The hackers all used social engineering attacks that exploited human behavior and, in particular, vulnerable, legacy MFA technology. As quickly as Chief Technology and Information Officers, and Identity Access Management Architects supplement passwords with phishable, one-time passwords or clunky push MFA apps, hackers are finding new ways to exploit security’s ‘human’ element. In the 2022 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report, the human element was identified as the root cause of 82% of 4,000 data breaches studied. Juniper Research forecasts that the total number of exposed records from data breaches will grow by 33% over the next four years, reaching 27.5 billion in 2027.





2







So, after 60 years of passwords, we believe the market is in the midst of a fundamental evolution in the science of authentication, with a renewed push to replace these hated and insecure credentials with cryptographic FIDO2 passkeys, or a FIDO token bound to a device. According to Research and Markets, the market for Passwordless Authentication is projected to grow over the next 10 years at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of more than 16%, to almost $54 billion by 2030, from approximately $13 billion today. North America is expected to dominate the global passwordless authentication market, currently accounting for at least 38% of the worldwide market. Further, with the data indicating that banking and healthcare are dominating the shift to passwordless authentication, we feel confident that we are targeting the right market segments.



Passwords are not only ripe for compromise. They also cost organizations time and money. Estimates indicate that an organization with 15,000 employees can lose annually up to $4 million in productivity, with employees spending over 12 hours per year on remembering, searching for and resetting passwords. Organizations also allocate significant IT resources to manage and store passwords. Forrester Research has stated that the average help desk labor cost for a single password reset is about $70. (Forrester Research “Best Practices: Selecting, Deploying, And Managing Enterprise Password Managers” 2018) Forrester Research determined that large organizations spend up to $1 million per year on staffing and infrastructure to handle password resets alone.



MarketsandMarkets, the B2B research firm, projects that the global digital identity solutions market will grow from $27.9 billion in 2022 to $70.7 billion by 2027, at a five-year CAGR of 20.4%. The company attributes this significant growth to the increase in identity-related frauds and data breaches, as well as compliance with existing and upcoming regulations. The firm further predicts that the market for digital identity and document verification services, a subset of the digital identity market, offers significant potential for growth opportunities, with revenues to rise from $9.9 billion in 2022 to $18.6 billion by 2027 (MarketsandMarkets “Digital Identity Solutions Market- Global Forecast to 2027” 2022 and “Identity Verification Market Global Forecast to 2027” 2022).



The Drive for Zero Trust Security



The term ‘Zero Trust’ first coined in 2010, by Forrester analyst John Kindervag, declares that all network traffic is untrusted and that any request to access any resource must be done securely. (Forrester Research “Build Security Into Your Network’s DNA: The Zero Trust Network Architecture”, 2010). Zero Trust requires that all users, both inside or outside the organization’s network, be authenticated before being allowed to access applications and data.



In 2021, as the rate of cybercrime, digital fraud and ransomware spiraled upward, the Biden Administration issued an executive order (the “Biden Order”) calling on the U.S. government to institute “bold changes and significant investments” in security measures to better insulate federal networks from attack. This was followed by the White House Office of Management and Budget in October 2021 defining a “zero trust” strategy, outlining the security architecture required to overhaul federal cybersecurity practices. In January 2022, the Administration gave federal agencies until the end of the fiscal year 2024 to “achieve specific zero trust security goals.”



The Zero Trust approach will likely further drive nationwide adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA), the requirement of additional verification factors, so users cannot log in with just a username and password. Solutions for achieving zero trust are not likely to include legacy MFA options like vulnerable one-time pin codes or easy-to-discover, knowledge-based questions like “What was the make of your first car?” The Biden Order specifically stated that “agency systems must discontinue support for authentication methods that fail to resist phishing, including protocols that register phone numbers for SMS or voice calls, supply one-time codes, or receive push notifications” Attacks on these legacy methods have proven enterprises will need stronger authentication alternatives to establish trust and defend against highly sophisticated cybercriminal networks.



The Biden Order is expected to drive deployment of upgraded security methods by both the federal government and private sector businesses that contract with the government. We may also expect to see a change from security vendors and enterprise organizations across a range of market segments, as they look to the Biden Order for guidance. In the post-COVID-19 scenario, the global zero trust security market size is projected to grow from $ 27.4 billion in 2022 to $ 60.7 billion by 2027, recording a CAGR of 17.3% from 2022 to 2027 (MarketsandMarkets, “Zero-Trust Security Market Global Forecast to 2027” ). Furthermore, in a recent survey conducted by Okta, “The State of Zero Trust Security 2022” they predicted that zero trust option rates passed a critical threshold in 2022. The Okta survey found that more than half of the organizations surveyed (55%) have a Zero Trust initiative in place, and the vast majority (97%) plan to have one in the coming 12 to 18 months.



Remote Working



Over the last three years, the pandemic’s stay-at-home mandates accelerated the transition to remote and hybrid work across many industries. Today, even as more companies started return to work in the office, data show that millions of workers will continue to work remotely and hybrid.





3







While remote, decentralized teams and hybrid work environments have become common, remote work can also increase opportunities for hackers to infiltrate corporate networks. Enterprise IT organizations must now address new IT requirements and cyber challenges generated in the work from home environment. Studies have also shown that employees are more likely be distracted when working from home and more susceptible to phishing scams. According to Equifax, cyber- attacks are much more likely to occur through mundane errors like a user choosing an easy-to-guess password or not changing the default password on something like a router.



To meet the increased enterprise security and mobility needs of this expanded remote workforce, IT decision makers are reassessing their data protection strategies in an effort to secure these remote workers and protect company assets. While IT continues to drive password hygiene through security training sessions, we believe legacy tools like one-time pin codes and knowledge-based authentication are no longer effective in mitigating risks.



The result is increased demand for next-generation biometric authentication technology and a greater urgency to transform quickly. According to Ranjit Atwal, Senior Research Director at Gartner, “Through 2024, organizations will be forced to bring forward digital business transformation plans by at least five years. Those plans will have to adapt to a post-COVID-19 world that involves permanently higher adoption of remote work and digital touchpoints



The FIDO Alliance – The Mission To Eliminate Passwords



The reliance on passwords has long been acknowledged as highly frustrating for users, costly for organizations to maintain and reset quickly, as well as one of the weakest security practices for user authentication. The reuse of the same passwords by individuals across multiple sites, the massive data breaches targeting user credentials, and widespread phishing efforts by hackers to entice users to ‘reveal’ passwords create security risks for every organization.



The Fast Identity Online (“FIDO”) Alliance was formed in 2012 to address the security risks to enterprises and the problems individual users face in creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. FIDO compliant solutions eliminate passwords by using the combination of biometric verification and device authentication via cryptographic security, thereby speeding up and securing user login. FIDO Alliance members include global leaders and household names in technology and across enterprise software, payments, banking, telecom, ecommerce, identity, government, and healthcare (https://fidoalliance.org/members/). This cross-industry coalition works jointly to develop interoperable authentication standards that reduce reliance on passwords with authentication that is more secure, private, and easier to use.



In 2022, three of the world’s largest tech companies – Apple, Microsoft, and Google (Alphabet) – each pledged passwordless initiatives and lauded FIDO2 standards that enable passkey technology. As members of the FIDO Alliance, we also have been working towards the same goal. We believe these initiatives enhance prospects for authID’s products, as it indicates the industry is moving to a passwordless future, in which our unphishable Human Factor Authentication could play an integral part.



FIDO, however, has some shortcomings, and this is where we see a tremendous opportunity for authID. FIDO authentication is still vulnerable to first and second-party fraud, and an enterprise still does not know with certainty ‘who is behind that device’. In short – device authentication by itself simply does not provide an indisputable audit trail of “Who” made a purchase, or “Who” transferred funds.



Our Verified platform solves this problem by offering adaptive authentication by combining “Something You Have – your FIDO2 device” with “Something You Are – your Verified Selfie”. Together device biometrics coupled with cloud biometrics eliminate passwords, while delivering the highest identity assurance, secured by a seamless user experience.



Identity Verification Impact Across Sectors



Financial services, ecommerce, the sharing economy, and healthcare businesses are confronted by the challenges of identifying their customers, patients and benefits recipients with ease and certainty in the digital world. Organizations across all sectors need to control access to their data and technology systems by their employees. Governments around the world are imposing new data privacy and authentication regulations, which also impose a “call to action” for many of these businesses and organizations. authID’s approach is to offer our products to enterprises and organizations for their customers in a Customer Identity & Access Management (“CIAM”) model as well as for their employees in a workforce model.

Financial Services & Fintech



Financial services institutions are facing a range of digital transformation challenges and a growth in the embrace of non-traditional fin-tech providers, such as non-bank lending companies, peer-to-peer mobile payment apps and the rapid emergence of cryptocurrencies, NFT’s and other digital assets exchanges. Key to this effort is providing enhanced digital customer experience while balancing the need for high assurance identity authentication to prevent fraud and account take-over throughout the customer journey,



Convenience, however, traditionally opposes stronger identity assurance – the easier it is to open or access an account, the less safeguards there may be to prevent fraud. Javelin Strategy & Research found that in 2021 identity fraud losses in the US financial services industry exceeded $52 billion. (Javelin Strategy & Research “2022 Identity Fraud Report” 2022). The study reported that identity fraud losses due to the use of a consumer’s personal information amounted to $24 billion and impacted 15 million U.S. consumers. Identity fraud scams that involved direct contact with victims by criminals, to steal passwords and other personally identifiable information totaled $28 billion and affected 27 million U.S. consumers.



LexisNexis found that the cost of fraud for U.S. financial services and lending firms has increased, with every $1 of fraud loss now costing U.S. financial services firms $4, up 25% from 2019. Their study also found that fraudsters followed consumer’s pandemic shift towards mobile transactions, with more than half of surveyed financial services firms reporting a 10% or greater increase in fraud in the mobile channel (“LexisNexis® True Cost of Fraud™ Study: Financial Services & Lending”, 2021). And with 40% of all fraudulent activity related to account takeover reported to occur within a day after the attack, the need for strong customer authentication is critical.



Experts recommend that efforts to combat this fraud must focus on moving consumers from static passwords to safer authentication methods. According to Gartner, their clients are increasingly seeking “passwordless” authentication methods such as FIDO2 Strong Authentication to improve user experience and enhance security by eliminating centrally stored passwords—a key target for cyber criminals (Gartner Research Ibid). Goode Intelligence believes that mobile biometrics are key to securely effecting this transformation and forecasts that over $5.8 trillion of mobile biometric payments will be made annually and over three billion biometric payment users by 2026 (Goode Intelligence “Mobile Biometrics for Financial Services; Market and Technology Analysis, Adoption Strategies and Forecasts 2021-2026”2021).



Healthcare



Since 2020, remote healthcare services have expanded exponentially - virtual urgent-care visits spiked by 683% between March and April 2020, while virtual, nonurgent care visits grew by an unprecedented 4,345% (Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association “COVID-19 transforms health care through telemedicine: Evidence from the field” 2020). ResearchAndMarkets predicts that the global telemedicine market will increase from $ 91 billion in 2022 to over $380 billion by 2030. (ResearchAndMarkets “Telemedicine Market Research Report 2022 to 2030”. 2022).



Unfortunately, with this shift to remote care, a record of weak authentication practices such as shared passwords, and a trove of rich personal data, the healthcare market is believed to be even more susceptible to identity fraud. Further, IBM reported that the healthcare sector continued to be the highest data breach cost industry for the 12th year in a row, with the average cost of a breach increasing to $10.10 million in 2022, an increase of 9.4% over 2021(IBM Security “Cost of Data Breach Report 2022” 2022). In 2021, health data breaches impacted more than 40 million people, and over 550 organizations reported such violations to the US Department of Health and Human Services (Health IT Security 2021).



Medical identity theft has an annual economic impact of around $41 billion a year and the value of stolen medical information is 10 times the value of stolen credit cards. Identity thieves can use compromised medical records to acquire medical treatment, receive elective surgery, and even fill prescriptions using the victim’s personal details. In one study, 20 percent of victims indicated they got the wrong diagnosis or treatment, or that their care was delayed because there was confusion about what was true in their records due to identity theft. In addition, because there are currently no regulatory consumer protections in place that limit the financial liabilities for medical identity fraud, the average out-of-pocket cost to victims is $13,500 (Medical Identity Fraud Alliance).



Privacy Regulations (Ethical AI)



All business, governmental and other sectors of society are impacted by the need for organizations to comply with increasing data privacy and authentication regulations. The European Union has led the way with its General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, widely considered the gold standard of data privacy regulation, and other jurisdictions around the world are scrambling to catch up. The United States has been slow and has only limited regulation at the federal level, which applies only to specific industries such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. It is therefore falling to the States and local authorities to adopt data privacy requirements such as the California Consumer Privacy Act or CCP and Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act or BIPA, which are being cloned by other jurisdictions. We believe that this growing trend will impose an urgency on organizations of all descriptions to improve their data security and privacy processes, and we believe that biometric identity verification will be a key part of the solution.

To achieve our goals of increasing our product penetration in the identity authentication market, the following plans comprise our growth strategy. authID intends to expand our focus on channel partners, by signing payment processors, system integrators and additional software suppliers. The Company also intends to increase its investment in developing, patenting and acquiring the various elements necessary to enhance our Verified platform, which are intended to allow us to achieve our growth goals.
Channel Strategy



We intend to expand upon our channel strategy in order to bring our products to a broad market in an efficient and cost-effective way. We have signed and are pursuing channel partners that play a key role in their respective verticals. We are also pursuing additional strategic partners, including payment processors, system integrators and software suppliers.



These channel partners provide access to their wide-ranging enterprise customer portfolios, including new fintech disruptors, merchant services, ecommerce and sharing economy businesses, all of whom we believe could benefit from the use of our identity verification and authentication software products. By entering into agreements with such channel partners and leveraging their relationships, we believe we can expand our footprint much more rapidly and cost effectively, as compared to pursuing direct sales efforts with each customer. We continue to maintain a small, high-touch, strategic sales team to identify new use cases and drive expansion and standardization on authID within our partners’ customer portfolios.



Innovation



As banking, fintech, healthcare providers, traditional and online retailers, continue to drive digital transformation across their channels, we aim to be at the forefront by developing new software products that leverage our platform and core competencies in biometric identity authentication. Our focus on innovation, is intended to add value to and retain our existing customers, as well as attract new customers. authID intends to build on its patented and patent pending solutions by using machine learning to enhance the artificial intelligence capabilities of our Verified software and platform. Our mission is to make the authID biometric Verified platform the fastest and most accurate in the market, and then to continually improve our platform to maintain our leading position.



Consumer frustration with passwords, along with phishing attacks, social engineering and data breaches have driven the need to eliminate passwords and accelerate adoption of multifactor security across all channels. Today there are more than 5 billion smartphones, laptops and tablets around the world that can be used as secure authentication devices to access online services and authorize transactions. These trends are driving the need for a simple, secure, and fast way to manage device registration and deregistration. By combining our patent pending methods for single message authentication, authorization, and audit, and for device registration through strong identity verification, authID has created an Identity Recovery (IDR) software product that puts device management in the control of the account owner. By eliminating the need for users to contact a support center, this product helps our enterprise customers reduce their systems and personnel costs for supporting users attempting to recover their identity or register a new device for authentication.

We are a member of the FIDO Alliance, the leading international organization comprising global leaders in technology that help establish best practices for FIDO authentication deployment. FIDO compliant solutions eliminate passwords by using the combination of biometric verification and device authentication via cryptographic security, thereby speeding up and securing user login. Our Verified FIDO2 passwordless authentication branded HFA is certified by the FIDO Alliance to be compliant and interoperable with FIDO specifications. 



In November 2021, the Company received a US patent for Systems and Methods Using a Primary Account Number to Represent Identity Attributes (the ’777 Patent”). The ’777 Patent is for a method that enables various attributes of the individual, to be securely linked to a Primary Account Number (PAN) to authenticate the user’s identity. The PAN of a user may then be used for identifying a user, without any sensitive data being released, as well as used to provide access, such as accessing a bank account, or other payment method of the user. The PAN has become the most ubiquitous way of processing credit card and other payment transactions, which can be sent over established communications networks between banks and merchants anywhere in the world. Using this invention, identity authentication transactions can be authorized via the individual’s biometrics, such as the user’s unique facial features and routed over the same networks in the same way as payment transactions.



In May 2022, the Company received a US patent for “A Method and System for Transaction Authorization Based on a Parallel Autonomous Channel Multi-User and Multi-Factor Authentication” (the “’299 Patent”). The ’299 Patent protects a core component of authID’s intellectual property relating to its Verified identity verification platform. The patent comprises a method that enables an account holder to authorize a transaction, and at the same time a third-party identity verifier (such as authID) to validate the identity of the account holder, for example through a personal code or biometrics, and confirm the account holder’s consent for the transaction. By orchestrating authentication transactions, authID’s method combines explicit consent for the transaction with identity verification, and creates a permanent record of both, for all parties, secured with a unique digital signature.



Select Acquisitions



As we have done in the past, we intend to selectively pursue acquisitions that will help us achieve our strategic goals, enhance our technology capabilities and accelerate growth. We believe pursuing these types of acquisitions will increase our ability to work with existing customers, add new customers, enter new markets, develop new services and enhance our processing platform capabilities. However, we have no commitments with respect to any such acquisitions at this time.
Marketing and Sales



The Company will primarily target these market segments: 1) fintech and other disrupters of traditional commerce, 2) businesses requiring zero-trust authentication for their workforce and 3) Fortune 1000 enterprises via channel and OEM partnerships established with some of the largest identity access management providers (IAM), privileged access management companies (PAM), risk engines, payment providers, and adjacent software providers. To serve these segments, we have begun to offer turn-key solutions via authID’s Verified CloudConnect program, supporting industry leading IAM, banking and ecommerce platforms to allow our software to be easily deployed with low-code or even no-code implementations.



Our branding and messaging will focus on the fact that all three segments understand the critical requirement to deliver unphishable authentication without friction. The Company’s marketing will emphasize the high return on investment that any business whether for their workforce or consumer applications can achieve if they replace password models with passwordless, biometric authentication software. We intend to draw prospects to authID by our ability to empower them to fight synthetic identities, account takeovers, phishing attacks while achieving their digital transformation goals. The contracts we seek will be of a recurring nature where we receive an annual fee for every active user (who logs into an application, changes their account profile, or attempts a high value transaction).



In order to achieve these goals and thereby drive sales and new revenue, the Company continues to focus on our sales activities, as well as invest in innovative technologies.



Revenue Model



Verified software licenses



The Company provides its new Verified platform services based on a subscription model, with tiered fees per enrolled user Verified Workforce) or active user (Verified Consumer), comprising a periodic subscription and where applicable a per transaction for proof transaction and the number of proof transactions required per year (for example the number of times a consumer is required to present proof of identity).

Competition



authID offers its Verified™ Identity Authentication platform allowing the Company to on-board customers who wish to deploy our services and solutions in order to eliminate passwords and know with biometric certainty the user who is engaging with their systems. authID’s solutions include the ability to verify the identity of a user, via remote identity verification, then enable device and transaction authentication using both device and cloud biometrics and, all digitally signed by the user’s identity. The Company’s platform allows our customers’ users to engage with the Verified platform using commodity, consumer grade mobile or desktop devices via a web-browser or corresponding Android or iOS smartphone app.



The Company’s proprietary, patented Verified platform allows our customers to establish trust in identity, authenticate and verify an identity without a password but with both device and biometric certainty, and not with phishable passwords or one-time pin codes. authID.ai’s Verified platform has several identity verification and authentication products each facing different competitors and incumbent technologies we can replace.



For onboarding users, employees or customers remotely, Verified delivers seamless identity verification with quick, online identity document verification and facial biometric matching of a selfie to the identity credential photo with iBeta-certified liveness confirmation. Our FIDO2 strong customer authentication and passwordless login product leverages strong identity verification during device authenticator registration to create a digital chain of trust between biometrically verified individuals, their accounts, and their devices. Our FIDO2 authentication service also eliminates the risks and costs of legacy passwords and phishable MFA such as one-time pin codes. Rooted to a trusted identity obtained during the identity verification and onboarding process, our Verified biometric multi-factor authentication offers high-assurance, biometric, cloud-based, multi-factor authentication to secure high-risk transactions.



In reviewing the competitors that exist for the Company’s current and planned platform products relating to the three main elements of identity management: the establishing of identity, use of identity through device-based biometric authentication, and use of identity through cloud-based biometric verification, the Company considers a number of factors. authID’s platform utilizes an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) approach which combines the three elements into a single fast, secure, and fully automated, platform. authID believes that this full stack platform approach is exceptional in that it offers documentary identity verification, FIDO device authentication, and cloud based, biometric, multi-factor verification covering digital account access and transaction confirmation use cases for both consumer and workforce applications. The competitive landscape includes several companies that mainly address only one element, with some addressing multiple elements independently without a seamless integration between them.



In looking further at our competition, the Company does not consider providers which are major conglomerates with vertically integrated cybersecurity companies, due to the vast array of services which they offer. Furthermore, some of the competitors which do offer solutions for digital use cases, are major legacy providers offering hardware heavy solutions principally for governmental users. These include Idemia, Thales, and Supercom. This is in contrast to authID’s Identity authentication platform approach which is based on offering app and browser-based software products which are usable on mobile and desktop computing devices without additional hardware requirements.



To further breakdown the competitive landscape into companies that provide identity proofing we consider the following competitors: Jumio, Au10Tix, OnFido, Mitek, Trulioo, ID.me, Veriff, and Acuant. Companies that provide only a single solution may be seeking to combine with authentication and biometric verification technology providers to expand their ID proofing solutions’ capabilities. authID offers Identity Verification, which is used once at enrollment, whereas our authentication service is used over and over in a recurring revenue model. In appropriate cases we may decide to cooperate with these entities and yield the one-time revenue to gain the recurring authentication revenue.



Another aspect of the competitive landscape is device-based authentication products using the FIDO2 passwordless standard. Companies that are believed to be competing with authID in this area are: HYPR, Strongkey, Daon, Trusona, Callsign, Duo and Transmit Security.



authID believes that the added security of combining integrated cloud biometric authentication with device based FIDO2 authentication with integrated cloud biometric authentication meets the Zero Trust mandates for unphishable authentication that provides both device and identity signals of a user. Further the simplicity of looking at your phone to “trust your selfie” should compete well against these incumbents, and offer a more adoptable, ubiquitous, and cost-effective solution without dedicated hardware.



Finally, looking at the competitive landscape for cloud-based biometric identity authentication applications the companies that are believed to be competing with authID in this area are Jumio, Aware, Acuant, Au10Tix, and 1Kosmos.



There are new entrants into each of these markets continually. Each competitor may have a different offering or approach to solve similar problems, which overlap with those of the Company. Some competitors also include manufacturers who provide systems, or platform solutions to third party operators and, therefore, do not directly compete with the Company, which operates its own systems.

Governmental Regulations



The Company does not need or require any approval from government authorities or agencies in order to operate its regular business and operations. However, it is possible that any proposed expansion to the Company’s business and operations in the future would require government approvals.



Due to the security applications and biometric technology associated with the Company’s products and platforms, the activities and operations of the Company are subject to license restrictions and other regulations, such as (without limitation) export controls and other security regulation by government agencies. Expansion of the Company’s activities in payment processing may in due course require government licensing in different jurisdictions and may subject it to additional regulation and oversight.



Data protection legislation in various countries in which the Company does business (including Colombia) may require it to register its databases with governmental authorities in those countries and to comply with additional disclosure and consent requirements with regard to the collection, storage and use of personal information of individuals resident in those countries. In addition, a new privacy law took effect in California at the beginning of 2020, and in Maine in July 2020, and other states, such as New York are considering additional legislation. Specifically, several states have adopted or are considering adopting a Biometric Information Privacy Act, or BIPA modelled on the Illinois statute, which governs the collection, processing, storage and distribution of biometric information such as facial biometric templates and fingerprints. Several of these new statutes give individuals rights of action to sue violators, which have resulted in a number of class action law suits. These regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses.



Human Capital – Employees and Organization



The Company is dedicated to offering an exciting career to the best and brightest technical talent around the globe.

Recent Developments



On March 21, 2022, the Company entered into a Facility Agreement with Stephen J. Garchik, who was and is a shareholder of the Company (“Garchik”), pursuant to which Garchik agreed to provide to the Company a $10.0 million unsecured standby line of credit facility that could be drawn down in several tranches, subject to certain conditions described in the Facility Agreement (the “Original Facility Agreement”). Pursuant to the Original Facility Agreement, the Company paid Garchik a facility commitment fee of 100,000 shares of our common stock (the “Facility Commitment Fee”) upon the effective date of the Original Facility Agreement.

On March 8, 2023, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Facility Agreement with Garchik, pursuant to which the Company and Garchik amended and restated the Original Facility Agreement in its entirety (the “A&R Facility Agreement”), to replace the credit facility contemplated by the Original Facility Agreement with (i) an initial credit facility to the Company in an amount of $900,000 (the “Initial Funding”) and (ii) the parties to use their reasonable best efforts after the Initial Funding to negotiate the terms of a subsequent credit facility in the aggregate amount of $2,700,000 (the “Subsequent Funding”).



On March 9, 2023, pursuant to the A&R Facility Agreement, the Company entered into a promissory note in favor of Garchik (the “Initial Promissory Note”), pursuant to which Garchik loaned $900,000 (the “Principal Amount”) to the Company. At the same time, as a condition to Garchik providing the Principal Amount, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries, ID Solutions, Inc., FIN Holdings, Inc. and Innovation in Motion, Inc. (the “Guarantors”) entered into a guaranty of the Initial Promissory Note with Garchik (the “Guaranty”).



A&R Facility Agreement



Under the A&R Facility Agreement, Garchik agreed to provide the Initial Funding to the Company upon receipt of a fully executed Initial Promissory Note and an executed Release Agreement relating to the Original Facility Agreement (the “Release Agreement”). The Company and Garchik agreed to use reasonable best efforts to negotiate the terms of the Subsequent Funding and negotiations continue, but the A&R Facility Agreement will terminate if definitive documentation for the Subsequent Funding is not entered into before July 1, 2023, for any reason other than breach of a party’s obligations.



While the terms of the Subsequent Funding are subject to due diligence and final documentation, a summary of selected terms of the proposed financing is attached to the A&R Facility Agreement as Exhibit B thereto. The Subsequent Funding would be a $2,700,000 secured note facility with a 12% per annum interest rate, paid in kind, capitalized and added to the balance of the loan on a quarterly basis, calculated on a 360-day year basis, on the outstanding aggregate balance of the Subsequent Facility. The Subsequent Facility will mature twenty-four (24) months after effectiveness. Garchik will be granted a fully perfected, non-avoidable, first-priority security interest and lien on all assets of the Company. The Subsequent Facility would be the senior obligation of the Company and will rank senior in right to payment of the obligations under the existing Senior Secured Convertible Notes entered into between the Company and certain noteholders on March 21, 2022 (the “Convertible Notes”) and the liens granted in connection with the Subsequent Facility shall rank pari passu with the liens granted to holders of the Convertible Notes. Pursuant to this, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of two-thirds of the holders of Convertible Notes.



In satisfaction of a condition precedent to the Initial Funding under the A&R Facility Agreement, Thomas L. Thimot, Phillip L. Kumnick, Philip R. Broenniman, Michael A. Gorriz and Neepa Patel, comprising all directors of the Company’s Board of Directors other than Joseph Trelin, Michael L. Koehneman and Jacqueline L. White (the “Remaining Directors”), delivered to the Company executed resignation letters in escrow (the “Board Resignation Letters”) that became effective as of the Initial Funding. Also in satisfaction of a condition precedent to the Initial Funding under the A&R Facility Agreement, on March 9, 2023, the Board of Directors appointed Joseph Trelin to the Company’s Compensation and Audit Committees, effective as of the Initial Funding. On March 16, 2023, the Board of Directors appointed Joseph Trelin to the Chairman of the Board effective immediately.



The A&R Facility Agreement also provided Garchik with the right to nominate four (4) designees (not counting any Remaining Directors) (the “New Designees”) to be considered for election to the Board of Directors (the “Nomination Right”). In satisfaction of a condition precedent to the Initial Funding under the A&R Facility Agreement, as described in greater detail in Item 5.02 of this Current Report, the Board of Directors appointed four (4) New Designees to the Board, effective as of the Initial Funding. The Company also agreed that the Board of Directors would, promptly following the closing of the Initial Funding, evaluate candidates for appointment as replacement of Mr. Thimot as Chief Executive Officer and that, upon the earlier of appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer or April 3, 2023, Mr. Thimot’s resignation letter as Chief Executive Officer will be declared effective. The Company appointed Rhoniel A Daguro as Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Thimot’s resignation became effective on March 23, 2023. 



Initial Promissory Note



Interest accrues on the Principal Amount until paid in full at a per annum rate equal to 15%, computed on the basis of a 360-day year and twelve 30-day months, payable in arrears on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year commencing March 31, 2023 or the first business day following each such date if any such date falls on a day which is not a business day, in cash. The Principal Amount shall mature on March 31, 2025.



The Company made standard (i) affirmative covenants to Garchik, including, but not limited to, in regard to its existence, payment obligations, business activities, financial information and use of proceeds and (ii) negative covenants to Garchik, including, but not limited to, in regard to the rank of indebtedness, incurrence of indebtedness, maintenance of insurance and properties, transactions with affiliates and disposition of assets.

While the Initial Promissory Note is unsecured, in the event of either (I) the conversion of the Convertible Notes of all amounts outstanding thereunder and the release of all liens over the Company’s assets granted by and through the Transaction Documents (as defined in the Convertible Notes) or (II) receipt of the consent of the requisite holders of the Convertible Notes, in each case, the Company will, as collateral security for the due and punctual payment and performance of all obligations under the Initial Promissory Note, pledge and assign to Garchik a first-priority, continuing security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company, subject to exclusions consistent with those contained in the Transaction Documents. The Company has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Garchik an amendment to the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 21, 2022 (the “SPA”), pursuant to which the Convertible Notes were purchased, permitting the grant of that collateral security to Garchik. Upon the grant of that collateral security, interest will accrue on the outstanding Principal Amount under the Initial Promissory Note at a per annum rate equal to 12%, paid in kind, capitalized and added to the balance of the loan on a quarterly basis, calculated on a 360-day year basis.



The Initial Promissory Note includes customary Events of Default, including, among other things, (i) failing to make payment of any of the Principal Amount or interest due and such failure continues for not less than 5 business days without being cured; (ii) any representation or warranty in the Initial Promissory note being untrue in any material respect and such failure continuing for a period of not less than 5 business days without being cured; or (iii) the Initial Promissory Note shall for any reason cease to be, or shall be asserted by the Company or any affiliate thereof not to be, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company. Upon an Event of Default, Garchik can declare all outstanding amounts under the Initial Promissory Note due, along with any accrued interest.



Guaranty



In connection with the Company and Garchik entering into the Initial Promissory Note, each Guarantor of the Company agreed to, for the benefit and security of Garchik, guarantee the payment and performance all of the Company’s obligations under the Initial Promissory Note and the Guaranty.
