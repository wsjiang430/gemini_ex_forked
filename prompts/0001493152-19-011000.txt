Item 1. Business.
 
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with World Health Energy Holdings, Inc.’s, (“we” “us” “our” the “Company” or “WHEH” or “WHEN”) audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein. We were incorporated on May 21, 1986 in the state of Delaware. WHEH is a diversified energy, health, and security technology company with corporate offices that are located in Boca Raton, Florida and Ramat Gan, Israel.
 
WHEH is a holding company which owns an algae-tech business and various software technology businesses. The company does not have revenues yet but is planning on launching its products in the near future. The Company is actively looking and needs to raise capital for its going concerns until it produces revenues. WHEH’s eventual plan is to spin-off its businesses into subsidiary public companies. However, there can be no assurance that the foregoing can occur as planner, or at all.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2014 up until our July 1, 2015 acquisition of FSC Solutions, Inc. (“FSC”) the Company’s primary focus was the production of algae using their proprietary GB3000 growth system. The system quickly and efficiently grows algae for the production of biofuels and food protein. We also sought to produce and market high-quality, low-cost B100 biodiesel. Though, we believe that the Company has been successful in demonstrating the effectiveness of the GB3000 system on a small-scale the Company has not yet been able to raise the necessary capital to implement their technologies on a commercial scale. The Company continues to pursue all available options for raising the necessary capital in addition to exploring alternative revenue sources including joint ventures and mergers with existing Green Energy organizations.
 
FSC Solutions, Inc. On June 26, 2015, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with FSC and its shareholders which included Uri Tadelis, our former Chief Executive Officer and Director and our former Directors Chaim J. Lieberman and Gal Levy. The Agreement was effective as of July 1, 2015 which served as the closing date for the acquisition. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, we acquired all of the capital stock of FSC in exchange for the issuance of 70 billion shares of our unregistered common stock with the possibility of the issuance of an additional 130 Billion common shares upon FSC meeting certain milestones as outlined in the Agreement. Upon completion of the acquisition of FSC, we intended to employ FSC’s software and trading platform to enter the on-line trading industry. Subsequent to the completion of the acquisition, we determined that FSC did not have control over the trading platform and software we expected to acquire and operate. Consequently, we never commenced operations of this business and we are in discussions with the non-management sellers of FSC to resolve this issue that arose after closing and are evaluating our alternatives.
 
Amid Financial Centre, Ltd. On March 13, 2016, FSC entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Amid Purchase Agreement”) with Natalie Stock, Ltd. for the purchase of all of the outstanding shares of Amid Financial Centre, Ltd. (“Amid”), a Mauritius Company that operates as a broker-dealer. During the first quarter of 2016, an initial deposit of $20,000 was made as part of the Amid Purchase Agreement. Prior to December 31, 2016, we elected to terminate the Amid Purchase Agreement, and, as a result the $20,000 deposit was written off as an expense in 2016.
 
UCG, Inc. On October 23, 2017, the Company entered into definitive agreements (collectively the “Agreements”) to buy 70% of UCG INC, with each of Gaya Anastasia Rozensweig, one of the Company’s current directors and Giora Rozensweig, the Company’s current Interim Chief Executive Officer, as JTWRS (jointly “Gaya”), Uri Tadelis, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and a former director (“Uri”) and Chaim Lieberman, a former Company shareholder and former director (“Chaim” collectively, the “Shareholders” and each a Shareholder), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to the Shareholders an aggregate of six billion shares (the “Initial Share Issuance”) of the Company’s common stock, 0.0007 per share (the “Common Stock”), to be allocated equally among the Shareholders, in exchange for holdings of outstanding shares of UCG Inc., a newly formed Florida corporation (“UCG”), the outstanding shares of which are held by the Shareholders (in equal measure), representing in the aggregate 70% of the outstanding capital of UCG. UCG is engaged in Software development and following the transaction, it was planned that UCG was to become a majority owned subsidiary of the Company. Prior to the Agreements being closed or implemented, Chaim Lieberman, a former Shareholder and Director, passed away and Uri Tadelis, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, resigned from all positions with the Company. Subsequently, all outstanding shares of UCG reverted back to Gaya. As of this date, the Agreements have not closed but continue to be reviewed and revised. The anticipated closing date is expected prior to year-end 2019. However, there can be no assurance that the foregoing can occur as planned or at all.
