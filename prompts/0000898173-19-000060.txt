OUR BUSINESS
Our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy. We remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O’Reilly values, including superior customer service and expense control. Our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve, by providing a higher level of customer service and a better value position than our competitors to both DIY and professional service provider customers.
Competitive Advantages
We believe our effective dual market strategy, superior customer service, technically proficient store personnel, strategic distribution network and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages, which cannot be easily duplicated.
Proven Ability to Execute Our Dual Market Strategy:
For more than 35 years, we have established a track record of effectively serving, at a high level, both DIY and professional service provider customers. We believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage. The execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of automotive aftermarket parts consumers, capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure, operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors, and enhancing service levels offered to DIY customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service provider customers.
In 2018, we derived approximately 57% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 43% of our sales from our professional service provider customers. Historically, we have increased our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to DIY customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business, which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation. We believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business, due to our systems, knowledge and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket, supported by our approximately 790 full-time sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer. We will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on growing our DIY business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy in both existing and new markets.
Superior Customer Service:
We seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant in-store experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products. We believe the satisfaction of DIY and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide, in a timely fashion, the specific automotive products needed to complete their repairs. Accordingly, each O’Reilly store carries, or has same or next day availability to, a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications. We continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores and within our network, based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system, market vehicle registration data, failure rates and management’s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace. We have no material backorders for the products we sell.
We seek to attract new DIY and professional service provider customers and retain existing customers by offering superior customer service, the key elements of which are identified below:

• | superior in-store service through highly-motivated, technically-proficient store personnel (“Professional Parts People”);


• | an extensive selection and availability of products;


• | many enhanced service programs, including battery and electrical testing, battery, wiper and bulb replacement and check engine light code extractions;


• | attractive stores in convenient locations;


• | competitive pricing, supported by a good, better, best product assortment designed to meet all of our customers’ quality and value preferences; and


• | a robust point-of-sale system integrated with our proprietary electronic catalog, which contains a wide variety of product images, schematics and technical specifications and equips our Team Members with highly effective tools to source products in our extensive supply network.

Technically Proficient Professional Parts People:
Our highly-motivated, technically-proficient Professional Parts People provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly over less specialized retail operators. We require our Professional Parts People to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard part repairs, in order to better serve the technically-oriented professional service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis. Such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our DIY customers who value the expert assistance provided by our Professional Parts People. 
Strategic Regional Tiered Distribution Network:
We believe our commitment to a robust, regional, tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hard-to-find parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network. Our strategic, regional, tiered distribution network includes DCs and Hub stores. Our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more DCs, which provides for efficient inventory control and management. We currently operate 27 regional DCs, which provide our stores with same-day or overnight access to an average of 156,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”), many of which are hard-to-find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers. To augment our robust distribution network, we operate a total of 342 Hub stores that also provide delivery service and same-day access to an average of 66,000 SKUs from a Super Hub or 42,000 SKUs from a Hub to other stores within the surrounding area. We believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business.
Experienced Management Team:
Our Company philosophy is to “promote from within” and the vast majority of our senior management, district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the Company. We augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience. We have a strong management team comprised of 194 senior managers who average 20 years of service; 254 corporate managers who average 16 years of service; and 518 district managers who average 13 years of service. Our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 26 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in April of 1993. 
Growth Strategy 
Aggressively Open New Stores:
We intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket. During 2018, we opened 200 net, new stores, and in 2019, we plan to open approximately 200 to 210 net, new stores, which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new, contiguous markets. The sites for these new stores have been identified, and to date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to O’Reilly stores. In addition, after the close of business on December 31, 2018, we acquired the 33 Bennett Auto Supply, Inc. stores that were not included in our 2018 store count and were not operated by the Company in 2018. We typically open new stores by 

(i) | constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory;


(ii) | acquiring an independently owned auto parts store, typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets (other than realty) of such store; or


(iii) | purchasing multi-store chains.

New store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution. Other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns, demographic lifestyle segmentation, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, vehicles in operation, number and type of existing automotive repair facilities and competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius. 
We target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network. While we have, and continue to face, aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets, we believe we have competed effectively, and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively, in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets. We also believe that with our dual market strategy, we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas, which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket. Therefore, we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy.
4

Grow Sales in Existing Stores:
Profitable comparable store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy. To achieve improved sales and profitability at existing O’Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers. We believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business, it is customer satisfaction, whether of the DIY consumer or professional service provider, resulting from superior customer service, that generates increased sales and profitability.
Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions:
The automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented, and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains, like O’Reilly, to operate more efficiently and effectively than smaller independent operators, will result in continued industry consolidation. Our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new markets.
Continually Enhance Store Design and Location:
Our current prototype store design features optimized square footage, high ceilings, convenient interior store layouts, in-store signage, bright lighting, convenient ingress, egress and parking, and dedicated counters to serve professional service provider customers, each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies to enhance overall customer service. We continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance. During 2018, we relocated 18 stores and performed minor to major updates or renovations to approximately 1,000 additional stores. We believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in comparable store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network, which is strategically located to best serve our customers. 
Enhance and Improve Customer Omnichannel Experience:
Regardless of how our customers begin their interaction, whether in-store, over the telephone or digitally, and complete their transaction, whether in-store or delivery to their home or business, our goal is to provide excellent customer service and a seamless experience. Our user-friendly websites, www.OReillyAuto.com and www.FirstCallOnline.com, allow our customers to search product and repair content, check the in-store availability of our products, and place orders for either delivery or in-store pickup. We continue to improve the functionality of our websites to provide our customers with a user-friendly and convenient shopping experience, as well as a robust product and repair content information resource, which will continue to enhance the O’Reilly Brand.
Team Members
As of January 31, 2019, we employed 79,174 Team Members (49,476 full-time Team Members and 29,698 part-time Team Members), of whom 67,369 were employed at our stores, 8,372 were employed at our DCs and 3,433 were employed at our corporate and regional offices. A union represents 48 stores (506 Team Members) in the Greater Bay Area in California and has for many years. In addition, approximately 62 Team Members who drive over-the-road trucks in two of our DCs are represented by labor unions. Except for these Team Members, our Team Members are not represented by labor unions. Our tradition for 62 years has been to treat all of our Team Members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our “Live Green” culture, which emphasizes the importance of each Team Member’s contribution to the success of O’Reilly. This focus on professionalism and respect has created an industry-leading team, and we consider our relations with our Team Members to be excellent.
Store Network 
New Store Site Selection:
In selecting sites for new stores, we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution. Other key factors we consider in the site selection process are 

• | population density;


• | demographics, including age, ethnicity, life style and per capita income;


• | market economic strength, retail draw and growth patterns;


• | number, age and percent of makes and models of registered vehicles;


• | the number, type and sales potential of existing automotive repair facilities;


• | the number of auto parts stores and other competitors within a predetermined radius;


• | physical location, traffic count, size, economics and presentation of the site;


• | financial review of adjacent existing locations; and


• | the type and size of store that should be developed.

5

When entering new, more densely populated markets, we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale. After opening this initial cluster of new stores, we begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas. As these store clusters mature, we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas. This strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market.
Store Locations and Size:
As a result of our dual market strategy, we are able to profitably operate in both large, densely populated markets and small, less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket. Our stores, on average, carry approximately 23,000 SKUs and average approximately 7,400 total square feet in size. At December 31, 2018, we had a total of approximately 38 million square feet in our 5,219 stores. Our stores are served primarily by the nearest DC, which averages 156,000 SKUs, but also have same-day access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 342 Hub stores, which are comprised of 84 Super Hubs that average approximately 15,600 square feet and carry an average of 66,000 SKUs and 258 Hubs that average approximately 10,000 square feet and carry an average of 42,000 SKUs. 
We believe that our stores are “destination stores’’ generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity. Consequently, most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking, easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers.

Store Layout:
We utilize a computer-assisted store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent front room retail merchandise presentation and customize our hard-parts inventory assortment to meet the specific needs of each particular market area. Front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access, maximum selling space and to prominently display high-turnover products and accessories to customers. To ensure the best customer experience possible, we have selectively implemented bilingual, in-store signage based on the demographics in each store’s geographic area. Aisle displays and end caps are used to feature high-demand, seasonal merchandise, new items and advertised specials.
Store Automation:
To enhance store-level operations and provide consistently high levels of customer service, we operate exclusive store automation systems that deliver quick point-of-sale transaction processing times, reduce our customers’ checkout time, ensure accuracy and provide our Professional Parts People with immediate access to our proprietary electronic parts catalog, part images, technical schematics and pricing information based on each individual customer’s specific vehicle make, model and year.  These systems track in-store inventory availability and, through connectivity with our DC and corporate systems, allow real-time access to inventory available in nearby stores and DCs throughout our network.  Our systems also capture detailed sales information, which assists management in strategic planning, inventory control and distribution efficiency, and provide a mechanism to deliver ongoing Team Member training through our integrated digital learning platform.
Management Structure
Each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers, in addition to parts specialists, retail and/or installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store. Each of our 518 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 10 stores, which provides our stores with a strong operational support. 
Store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service, leadership, inventory management and store profitability, as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model. Store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position, including attending a week-long manager development program at the corporate headquarters in Springfield, Missouri. Store and district managers also receive continuous training through online training, field workshops, regional meetings and our annual leadership conference.
We provide financial incentives to all store Team Members through incentive compensation programs. Under our incentive compensation programs, base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based on individual and store sales and profitability. In addition, each of our district managers participates in our stock option and bonus programs, and store managers participate in bonus programs based on their store’s performance. We believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our store Team Members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.
Professional Parts People
We believe our highly trained team of Professional Parts People is essential in providing superior customer service to both DIY and professional service provider customers. A significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers; therefore, our Professional Parts People are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products. In addition, we have found that the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance from Professional Parts People, particularly when purchasing hard parts. The ability of our Professional Parts People to provide such assistance to the DIY customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat DIY business.
We screen prospective Team Members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs, or automotive aptitude. New store Team Members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our Company, as well as the requirements for their specific position. Additionally, during their first year of employment, our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide high levels of service to our customers. Once all of the required training has been satisfied, our parts specialists become eligible to take the O’Reilly Certified Parts Professional test. Passing the O’Reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (“ASE”).
All of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers. For this reason, select Team Members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager. These Team Members then spend at least one day 
8

per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers. Additionally, each Team Member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development.
Distribution Systems 
We believe that our tiered distribution model provides industry-leading parts availability and store in-stock positions, while lowering our inventory carrying costs by controlling the depth of our inventory. Moreover, we believe our ongoing, significant capital investments made in our DC network allow us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network. Our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores, and additional penetration into existing markets, in the regions surrounding each DC. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total growth capacity of more than 615 stores in our distribution center network, which will increase by approximately 275 stores with the completion of our Twinsburg, Ohio, DC in 2019. Further enhancing our distribution capabilities in 2020, we plan to relocate and merge our existing Nashville, Tennessee, and Knoxville, Tennessee, DCs into a larger facility located in Lebanon, Tennessee, providing a larger, more efficient facility to serve both markets, while also allowing us to convert the existing Knoxville, Tennessee, DC into a large Hub that will continue to provide same day parts availability in the attractive Knoxville market.
Distribution Centers:
As of December 31, 2018, we operated 27 DCs comprised of approximately 10.8 million operating square feet (see the “Properties” table in Item 2 of this annual report on Form 10-K for a detailed listing of DC operating square footages). Our DCs stock an average of 156,000 SKUs and most DCs are linked to and have the ability to access multiple other regional DCs’ inventory. Our DCs provide five-night-a-week delivery, primarily via a Company-owned fleet, to all of our stores in the continental United States. In addition, stores within an individual DC’s metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the DC’s “city counter,” many of which receive this service seven days per week. Our DCs provide weekend service to not only the stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic Hub locations, which redistribute products to surrounding stores. Our national Hub store network provides additional service throughout the week, and on weekends, to surrounding stores. With our planned DC expansion during 2019, we expect to end the year in 2019 operating 28 DCs comprised of approximately 11.2 million operating square feet.
As part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2019, we plan to

• | continue to enhance our distribution network through the engineering, design, expansion or relocation of new or current DCs;


• | continue to utilize routing software to continue to enhance logistics efficiencies;


• | continue to implement labor management software to improve DC productivity and overall operating efficiency;

•continue to define and implement best practices in all DCs; and

• | make proven, return-on-investment based capital enhancements to material handling equipment in DCs, including conveyor systems, picking modules, lift equipment and computer hardware.

Hub stores:
We currently operate a total of 342 strategically located Hub stores. In addition to serving DIY and professional service provider customers in their markets, Hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area and access to an expanded selection of SKUs on a same-day basis. Our Hub store network consists of 84 Super Hubs that average approximately 15,600 square feet and carry an average of 66,000 SKUs and 258 Hubs that average approximately 10,000 square feet and carry an average of 42,000 SKUs. 
Products and Purchasing
Our stores offer DIY and professional service provider customers a wide selection of products for domestic and imported automobiles, vans and trucks. Our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized, well-advertised, premium name brand products, such as AC Delco, Armor All, Bosch, Castrol, Dorman, Fel-Pro, Gates Rubber, Monroe, Moog, Pennzoil, Prestone, Quaker State, Standard, STP, Turtle Wax, Valvoline, Wagner, and Wix, and a wide selection of quality proprietary private label products, which span the entire good, better and best value spectrum, under our BestTest®, BrakeBest®, Import Direct®, MasterPro®, MicroGard®, Murray®, Omnispark®, O’Reilly Auto Parts®, Precision®, Power Torque®, Super Start®, and Ultima® brands. Our proprietary private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers, meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and consist of house brands and nationally recognized proprietary bands, which we have acquired or developed over time. Our “good” proprietary brands provide a great combination of quality and value, a characteristic important to our DIY customers, while our “better” and “best” proprietary brands offer options for our more heavy-duty DIY customers, as well as our professional service provider customers, who often prefer higher quality products that can be relied upon to support and grow their businesses.

We have no long-term contracts with material purchase commitments with any of our suppliers, nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts. We believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell. It is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers. We have entered into various programs and arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases. As a whole, we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good.
We purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 815 suppliers, the five largest of which accounted for approximately 24% of our total purchases in 2018. Our largest supplier in 2018 accounted for approximately 8% of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3% to 5% of our total purchases. 
Marketing 
Marketing to the DIY Customer:
We use an integrated marketing program, which includes radio, in-store, digital and social media promotions, as well as sports and event sponsorships and direct mail and newspaper promotional distributions, to aggressively attract DIY customers. The marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to a measurable increase in awareness of the O’Reilly Brand across our geographic footprint. We utilize a combination of brand, product and price messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases, which frequently coincide with key sales events. We also utilize a problem-resolution communication strategy, which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance on their vehicles, protecting their long-term automotive investment and establishing O’Reilly as their partner for auto parts needs.
To stimulate sales among racing enthusiasts, who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public, we sponsored multiple nationally-televised races and over 700 grassroots, local and regional motorsports events throughout 45 states during 2018. We were the title sponsor of two National Association for Stock Car Racing (NASCAR) National series events, in 2018.
During the fall and winter months, we strategically sponsor National Collegiate Athletic Association (“NCAA”) basketball. Our relationships with over 25 NCAA teams and tournaments have resulted in prominently displayed O’Reilly logos on TV-visible signs throughout the season.
We target Spanish-speaking auto parts customers through marketing efforts that include the use of Spanish language radio, print, and outdoor advertising, as well as sponsorships of local and regional festivals and events.
We invest in digital channels to expand the O’Reilly brand presence online and through mobile devices, as this continues to be an important point of contact with our customers. Search engine optimization and paid search strategies are used to drive traffic to our website, and popular social media platforms are used to provide excellent customer service through interaction and dialogue with our customers.
To show appreciation for our DIY customers for their continued business, we maintain our O’Reilly O’Rewards customer loyalty program. The program provides members with the opportunity to earn points through purchases and other special events and allows members to redeem those points for coupons, which provide discounts on future merchandise purchases in our stores. The programs allow us to reward our customers for their continued business, as well as enhance engagement with our customers to earn more of their business with targeted promotions tailored to their specific needs and purchasing patterns.
Marketing to the Professional Service Provider Customer:
We have approximately 790 full-time O’Reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas as part of our First Call program. Each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon, selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers. Targeted marketing materials such as flyers, quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers, paint and body shops and fleet customers. Our industry-leading First Call program enables our sales representatives, district managers, and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider customers by providing the products and services identified below:

• | broad selection of merchandise at competitive prices;


• | dedicated Professional Service Specialists in our stores;


• | multiple, daily deliveries from our stores;


• | same-day or overnight access to thousands of SKUs through seven days a week store inventory replenishments;


• | separate service counter and phone line in our stores dedicated exclusively to service professional service provider customers;

10


• | trade credit for qualified accounts;


• | First Call Online, a dedicated proprietary Internet based catalog and ordering system designed specifically to connect professional service provider customers directly to our inventory system;


• | Mitchell 1 shop management systems;


• | training and seminars covering topics of interest, such as technical updates, safety and general business management;


• | access to a comprehensive inventory of products and equipment needed to operate and maintain their shop; and


• | Certified Auto Repair Center Program, a program that provides professional service provider customers with business tools they can utilize to profitably grow and market their shops.

Marketing to the Independently Owned Parts Store:
We also sell automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores (“jobber stores”) in certain market areas. These jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an O’Reilly store. We administer a proprietary, dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores called Parts City Auto Parts that currently provides automotive products to approximately 180 jobber stores, with total annual sales of approximately $62 million. As a participant in this program, a jobber store, which meets certain financial and operational standards, is permitted to indicate its Parts City Auto Parts membership through the display of a trademarked logo owned by us. In return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from us, we provide computer software for business management, competitive pricing, advertising, marketing and sales assistance to Parts City Auto Parts affiliate stores.
Pricing 
We believe that competitive pricing is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business. Product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing of competitors in the market area served by each store. Most products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of internal gross margin targets and competitive reviews, with additional savings offered on some items through special promotional pricing and volume discounts. Consistent with our low price guarantee, each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any in-stock, locally available product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors.
Customer Payments and Returns Policy
Our stores accept cash, checks, debit and credit cards. We also grant credit to many professional service provider customers who meet our pre-established credit requirements. Some of the factors considered in our pre-established credit requirements include customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer and current economic and industry trends. No customer accounted for greater than one percent of our consolidated net sales, nor do we have any dependence on any single customer.
We accept product returns for new products, core products and warranty/defective products. 
INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT
The automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavy-duty vehicles after the original sale. The total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately $296 billion, according to The Auto Care Association. This market is made up of four segments: labor share of professional service provider sales, auto parts share of professional service provider sales, DIY sales and tire sales. O’Reilly’s addressable market within this industry is approximately $93 billion, which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales at wholesale and DIY sales at retail. We do not sell tires or perform for-fee automotive repairs or installations.
Competition 
The sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas, including customer service, product availability, store location, brand recognition and price. We compete in both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market. We compete primarily with 

• | national retail and wholesale automotive parts chains (such as AutoZone, Inc., Advance Auto Parts, CARQUEST, NAPA and the Pep Boys - Manny, Moe and Jack, Inc.);


• | regional retail and wholesale automotive parts chains;


• | wholesalers or jobber stores (some of which are associated with national automotive parts distributors or associations such as NAPA, CARQUEST, Bumper to Bumper and Auto Value);


• | automobile dealers; and

11


• | mass merchandisers and online retailers that carry automotive replacement parts, maintenance items and accessories (such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc.).

We compete on the basis of customer service, which includes merchandise selection and availability, technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel, price, store layout, continually enhancing the omnichannel experience and convenient and accessible store locations. Our dual market strategy requires significant capital, such as the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket. 
Inflation and Seasonality
We have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition costs increase due to price increases industry wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation.
To some extent our business is seasonal, primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. Store sales, profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.
Regulations
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business, including, but not limited to, those related to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, the recycling of batteries and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property. 
As part of our operations, we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with, for example, our oil and battery recycling programs. We currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third-party suppliers. The batteries and used lubricants are collected by our Team Members, deposited into supplier-provided containers and pallets, and then recycled by the third-party suppliers. In general, our agreements with such suppliers contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination, which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off-site properties (including as a result of waste disposal) and to our properties, when caused by the supplier.
Compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date. However, we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations.
