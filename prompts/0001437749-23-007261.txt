Competition
 
Superior competes in its Branded Products segment with a multitude of national and regional companies, such as, BDA, Inc., HALO Branded Solutions, Inc., Staples, Inc., Cimpress PLC, HH Global Group Limited, and Lands’ End, Inc. Superior also competes with local firms in most major metropolitan areas. The nature and degree of competition varies with the customer and the market. We believe our creative services, product development, proprietary web platforms and extensive global sourcing network, along with our major brands, enable us to be competitive and grow in this market. 
 
Major competitors for our Healthcare Apparel segment include companies such as Medline Industries, Inc., Careismatic Brands, Barco Uniforms, Inc., FIGS, Inc., Encompass Medical and Standard Textile Co., Inc. We are a significant supplier of scrubs and patient apparel to hospitals. We believe that the strength of our brands and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products, allow us to compete effectively.
 
The market in which our Contact Centers segment operates has evolved into a global multi-billion dollar marketplace that is highly competitive and fragmented. TOG’s competitors in the Contact Centers segment range in size from very small firms offering specialized services or short-term project completion to very large independent firms, and include the in-house operations of many customers and potential customers. We compete directly and indirectly with various companies that provide contact center and other business process solutions on an outsourced basis such as TaskUs, Transparent BPO, WebHelp, Focus Services, Ubiquity, CCI and RDI. TOG also competes with local entities in other offshore locations. The list of potential competitors includes both publicly traded and privately held companies.
 
Customers
 
The Branded Products segment has a substantial number of customers, none of which accounted for more than 10% of the segment’s 2022 net sales. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Healthcare Apparel segment's 2022 net sales. The Contact Centers segment’s largest customer represented 12% of the segment’s 2022 net sales.
Resources Material to Our Business
 
Raw Materials
 
The principal fabrics used in the manufacture of finished apparel goods for Superior's Branded Products segment and Healthcare Apparel segments are cotton, polyester, spandex, cotton-synthetic and poly-synthetic blends. The majority of such fabrics are sourced in China. If Superior or its suppliers are unable to source raw materials from China, it could significantly disrupt Superior’s business.
 
Superior does not have a concentration of suppliers of finished apparel goods in any single country or region of the world, however, it does manufacture the majority of its products in Bangladesh, China, Haiti, Madagascar, and Vietnam. Additionally, the Company’s suppliers generally source or manufacture finished goods in parts of the world that may be affected by economic uncertainty, political unrest, labor disputes, health emergencies, or the imposition of duties, tariffs or other import regulations by the United States. The Company believes that its redundant network of suppliers, including its own manufacturing facilities in Haiti, provide sufficient capacity to mitigate any dependency risks on a single supplier.
 
The Branded Products segment also relies on the supply of other types of raw materials, including plastic, glass and metal. The vast majority of these raw materials are principally sourced from China, either directly by BAMKO or its suppliers. If we are unable to continue to obtain our raw materials and finished products from China or if our suppliers are unable to source raw materials from China, it could significantly disrupt our business.
 
Prices within the promotional products industry are directly affected by the cost of raw materials. The market for promotional products is price sensitive and has historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. The Branded Products segment has flexibility in its suppliers, as other suppliers of the same or similar products are widely available. Additionally, the nature of the promotional products industry is such that should specific types of raw materials undergo significant cost increases, it is possible that alternative products using different materials could be utilized for similar promotional activities. However, if cost increases cannot be entirely passed on to customers and alternative suppliers or suitable product alternatives are unavailable, profit margins could decline.

Intellectual Property
 
Superior owns and uses several trade names, trademarks and service marks relating to its brands that have significant value and are instrumental to its ability to market its products. Superior’s most significant trade names are BAMKO® and HPI® within the Branded Products segment and The Office Gurus® within the Contact Centers segment. Superior’s most significant trademarks, which are critically important to the marketing and operation of Superior’s Healthcare Apparel segment, are Fashion Seal Healthcare® and WonderWink®. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Fashion Seal Healthcare (presently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office until 2029) and WonderWink (presently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office until August 2030) represented approximately 41% and 38%, respectively, of sales in that segment.
Seasonal Fluctuations
 
Our results of operations have not historically reflected material seasonal tendencies and we do not believe that seasonal fluctuations will have a material impact on us in the foreseeable future.
Effects of Compliance with Government Regulations
 
Trade Regulations
 
As disclosed above, the Company’s suppliers generally source or manufacture finished goods in parts of the world that may be affected by the imposition of duties, tariffs or other import regulations by the United States. The Company believes that its redundant network of suppliers, including its own manufacturing facilities in Haiti, provide sufficient capacity to mitigate any dependency risks on a single supplier.
 
The Branded Products segment relies on raw materials that are principally sourced from China, either directly by BAMKO or its suppliers. If we are unable to continue to obtain our raw materials and finished products from China or if our suppliers are unable to source raw materials from China, it could significantly disrupt our business. Further, we are affected by economic, political and other conditions in China and the United States, including those resulting in the imposition or increase of import duties, tariffs and other import regulations and those relating to widespread health emergencies and deteriorating diplomatic relations with China, which could have a material adverse effect on this business segment.
 
Environmental Matters
 
In view of the nature of our business, compliance with federal, state, and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has had no material effect upon our operations or earnings, capital expenditures or competitive position and we do not expect it to have a material impact in the foreseeable future.
Human Capital Resources
 
The Company’s key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop quality talent. To support these objectives, the Company’s human resources initiatives are designed to: keep people safe and healthy; enhance the Company’s culture; acquire and retain diverse talent; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefits and other programs; and develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions.
 
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 6,800 employees worldwide, of which approximately 6,600 were full-time employees and approximately 200 were part-time employees. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 900 employees were employed in the U.S. and approximately 5,900 employees were employed in foreign countries. The Contact Centers segment has the Company’s largest labor force at approximately 4,300 full-time employees as of December 31, 2022.
