Envestnet serves clients from its headquarters based in Chicago, Illinois, as well as other locations throughout the United States, India and other international locations. 
Segments
Envestnet is organized around two primary, complementary business segments. Financial information about each business segment is contained in “Note 21 – Segment Information” to the notes to consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. Our business segments are as follows:

• | Envestnet – a leading provider of unified wealth management software and services to empower financial advisors and institutions.


• | Envestnet | Yodlee – a leading data aggregation and data intelligence platform powering dynamic, cloud-based innovation for digital financial services.

Envestnet Segment
Envestnet empowers financial advisors at broker-dealers, banks and RIAs with all the tools they require to deliver holistic wealth management to their end clients. In addition, the firm provides advisors with practice management support so that they can grow their practices and operate more efficiently. At the end of 2018, Envestnet’s platform assets grew to approximately $2 trillion in nearly 11 million accounts overseen by more than 96 thousand advisors. 
Services provided to advisors include: financial planning, risk assessment tools, investment strategies and solutions, asset allocation models, research, portfolio construction, proposal generation and paperwork preparation, model management and account rebalancing, account monitoring, customized fee billing, overlay services covering asset allocation, tax management and socially responsible investing, aggregated multi‑custodian performance reporting and communication tools, plus data analytics.  Envestnet has access to a wide range of leading third‑party asset custodians.
We offer these solutions principally through the following product/services suites:

• | Envestnet | Enterprise – provides an end-to-end open architecture wealth management platform, through which advisors can construct portfolios for clients. It begins with aggregated household data which then leads to a financial plan, asset allocation, investment strategy, portfolio management, rebalancing and performance reporting. Advisors have access to over 19,100 investment products. Envestnet | Enterprise also sells data aggregation and reporting, data analytics and digital advice capabilities to customers. 


• | Envestnet | Tamarac™ provides leading trading, rebalancing, portfolio accounting, performance reporting and client relationship management software, principally to high‑end RIAs.

• | Envestnet | Retirement Solutions (“ERS”) offers a comprehensive suite of services for advisor-sold retirement plans. Leveraging integrated technology, ERS addresses the regulatory, data, and investment needs of retirement plans and delivers the information holistically.


• | Envestnet | PMC®, or Portfolio Management Consultants (“PMC”) – provides research and consulting services to assist advisors in creating investment solutions for their clients. These solutions include nearly 4,000 vetted third party managed account products, multi-manager portfolios, fund strategist portfolios, as well as over 1,200 proprietary products, such as quantitative portfolios and fund strategist portfolios. PMC also offers an overlay service, which includes patented portfolio overlay and tax optimization services.

 As the tables below indicate, Envestnet’s wealth management solutions have experienced steady and significant growth over the last several years. We believe this growth is attributable to secular trends in the wealth management industry, the uniqueness and comprehensiveness of our products, as well as acquisitions.
The following charts show growth in the number of advisors, accounts and assets supported by Envestnet, distinguishing those metrics between assets under management or administration (“AUM/A”) and subscription. Beginning March 31, 2018 and for periods thereafter, subscription metrics include assets, accounts and advisors associated with Envestnet | Tamarac performance reporting, where applicable. Previously, Envestnet | Tamarac’s metrics were limited to those associated with its rebalancer solution. Prior period metrics have been conformed to the new definition in the tables shown below:

Envestnet | Yodlee Segment
Envestnet | Yodlee is a leading data aggregation and data intelligence platform. As an artificial intelligence (“AI”) and data specialist, Envestnet | Yodlee gathers, refines and aggregates a massive set of end-user permissioned transaction level data, combines them with financial applications, reports, market research analysis, and application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for its customers.
More than 1,100 financial institutions, financial technology innovators and financial advisory firms, including 15 of the 20 largest U.S. banks, subscribe to the Envestnet | Yodlee platform to underpin personalized financial apps and services for over 23 million paid subscribers.
Envestnet | Yodlee serves two main customer groups: financial institutions (“FI”) and financial technology innovators, which we refer to as Yodlee Interactive (“YI”) customers.

• | The Financial Institutions group provides customers with secure access to open APIs, end-user facing applications powered by our platform and APIs (“FinApps”), and reports. Customers receive end user-permissioned transaction data elements that we aggregate and cleanse. Envestnet | Yodlee also enables customers to develop their own applications through its open APIs, which deliver secure data, money movement solutions, and other functionality. FinApps can be subscribed to individually or in combinations that include personal financial management, wealth management, card, payments and small-medium business solutions. They are targeted at the retail financial, wealth management, small business, card, lenders, and other financial services sectors. These FinApps help consumers and small businesses simplify and manage their finances, review their financial accounts, track their spending, calculate their net worth, and perform a variety of other activities. For example, Yodlee’s Expense FinApp helps consumers track their spending, and a Payroll FinApp from a third party helps small businesses process their payroll. The suite of reports is designed to supplement traditional credit reports by utilizing consumer permissioned aggregated data from over 20,000 sources, including banking, investment, loan, and credit card information.


• | The Yodlee Interactive group enables customers to develop new applications and enhance existing solutions. These customers operate in a number of sub-vertical markets, including wealth management, personal financial management, small business accounting, small business lending and authentication. They use the Envestnet | Yodlee platform to build solutions that leverage our open APIs and access to a large end user base. In addition to aggregated transaction-level account data elements, we provide YI customers with secure access to account verification, money movement and risk assessment tools via our APIs. We play a critical role in transferring innovation from financial technology innovators to financial institutions. For example, YI customers use Yodlee applications to provide working capital to small businesses online; personalized financial management, planning and advisory services; e-commerce payment solutions; and online accounting systems for small businesses. We provide access to our solutions across multiple channels, including web, tablet and mobile.

Both FI and YI channels benefit customers by improving end-user satisfaction and retention, accelerating speed to market, creating technology savings and enhancing their data analytics solutions and market research capabilities. End users receive better access to their financial information and more control over their finances, leading to more informed and personalized decision making. For customers who are members of the developer community, Yodlee solutions provide access to critical data and payments solutions, faster speed to market and enhanced distribution.
We believe that our brand leadership, innovative technology and intellectual property, large customer base, and unique data gathering and enrichment provide us with competitive advantages that have enabled us to generate strong growth.

• | Envestnet Analytics provides data analytics, mobile sales solutions, and online education tools to financial advisors, asset managers and enterprises. These tools empower financial services firms to extract key business insights to run their business better and provide timely and focused support to advisors. Our dashboards deliver segmentation analytics, multi-dimensional benchmarking, and practice pattern analyses that provide mission-critical insights to clients.

Market Opportunity
The wealth management industry has experienced significant growth in terms of assets invested by retail investors in the past several years. According to the Federal Reserve, U.S. household financial assets totaled approximately $90 trillion as 
9

of September 30, 2018, representing a sizeable wealth management opportunity. According to Capgemini's 2018 World Wealth report, global high-net-worth financial wealth is on course to exceed $100 trillion by 2025, up $30 trillion from 2017.
In the next 5-10 years, fewer firms will manage far more assets at a significantly lower cost. Industry margins will be squeezed making scale and operational efficiency far more important. Firms will need to integrate technology in all areas of the business and develop a clear strategy for the future. As low-cost products gain share and larger firms benefit from scale economies, there will likely be further consolidation and new forms of collaboration.
A number of significant trends are impacting the wealth management industry. Market forces are converging to bring about changes in wealth management, including those described below:

• | More consumers are recognizing the need for advice and are willing to pay for it. Consumers are also becoming more cost conscious and tech savvy. They want advice to be objective and non-conflicted.


• | Investment advice will be rooted in financial planning and centered on achieving investor goals.


• | There are significant gaps between the services investors actually receive and the wealth management services they would like to receive. The key change that wealth managers must deliver today is personalization.


• | Federal and state regulations and investor demand are changing, and a fiduciary standard is expected to become more broadly applicable in the investor-advisor relationship. According to Cerulli Associates Managed Accounts Qualitative Update 2018, fiduciary assets represented approximately 45% of industry assets as of 2017.


• | Based on data from Cerulli Associates, fee-based financial advisory services topped $10 trillion in 2017 and advisors had discretion over 57% of managed account assets in 2017 which is expected to climb to 59% by 2021.


• | Advisors are personally managing $2.8 trillion in assets but as Envestnet’s September 2018 Envestat showed, those advisors who attempt to “do it all” are experiencing mixed results, at best. Only a small percentage of advisors succeed at outperforming the market, and those advisors who do so have relatively fewer accounts and assets in their care. This opens the door to potentially more outsourcing of investment management by advisors to professional money managers and strategists.


• | According to various media sources, a massive wealth transfer estimated at $30 trillion is expected to take place over the next 30 to 40 years as baby boomers transition assets to their offspring (Gen X and Gen Y), who tend to favor greater use of technology in their engagement with advisors and prefer access to advice and their assets anywhere, anytime, and on any device.


• | Technology is transforming the financial advice industry. Control is shifting from manufacturers and distributors of products to consumers. As consumers become better informed in an increasingly complex market, they not only seek guided advice, but they seek unbiased advisors who put their best interest first. They demand greater transparency in product pricing.


• | Digital technology is revolutionizing the way financial advisors can do business as they increasingly employ technology to service clients.


• | Financial services firms will need to be able to interact with customers on a digital basis via investor portals and other technology.


• | Regulations and digital advice start-ups are putting pressure on advisor and firm fees and profit margins. To survive and thrive, advisors will need to increasingly rely on technology to achieve efficiency and scale to serve a growing client base.


• | We are entering a new era of the unified advisory platform (“UAP”), a single, all-encompassing platform, which creates one advisory superstructure. The UAP will drive profound changes throughout the financial services industry and will remove structural silos. The most important feature of a UAP is the aggregation of all programs on a unified technology architecture. The UAP gives advisors a comprehensive view of a client's entire household portfolio. It simplifies portfolio management by allowing the advisor to organize all the client's advisory accounts from a single desktop portal. Nearly half of managed account sponsors are moving towards a single account architecture, but three-quarters of firms say this could take more than a year or two to achieve.

These trends are impacting Envestnet’s business and creating a significant market opportunity for technology‑enabled investment solutions and services like ours.
A technological shift is also underway in the broader financial services industry. Outdated enterprise hardware and software are being replaced by cloud-driven solutions that are easier and less expensive to implement, update and manage. Banks continue to spend heavily on IT in order to compete effectively in an increasingly competitive environment. The addressable market opportunity is large.

• | As financial institutions continue to spend on technology, we believe a growing proportion of that spending will shift to cloud-based solutions.

10


• | In addition to the opportunity that exists with traditional financial institutions, we believe that we also have a significant opportunity with Internet services companies providing innovative financial solutions.


• | Open platforms and application-level developer ecosystems are driving innovation forward. New technology platforms are leveraging big data.


• | As mentioned in PwC’s Asset and Wealth Management report, investors want solutions for specific needs, not products that fit style boxes. Technology is enabling outcome-based planning. It can quickly identify important life goals and solutions to match. Technology and data analytics are expected to be used to construct multi-asset outcome-based solutions using low-cost building blocks such as ETFs or index trackers. For just a small fee, computer algorithms will be able to create customized solutions.


• | It is widely believed that technology is set to disrupt all areas of wealth management. Studies have shown that:


◦ | 58% of an advisor’s occupation can be digitized using AI;


◦ | 73% of 18 to 34 year olds would try a tech firm’s credit card, deposit account, investment or mortgage; and


◦ | 69% of advisory firms’ websites are optimized for mobile use.


• | A report from Roubini Thought Lab indicated that by 2022, the “SMAC” stack (social, mobile, analytics, and cloud) will become a necessity for investment providers, and over half of those surveyed plan to use a cloud platform to replace their legacy systems. Digitally advanced firms now spend approximately 17% of their revenue on technology and plan to increase that investment to 24% by 2022.


• | Given that clients expect to be able to access their account information from any device at any time, advisors (and financial services firms in general) must be prepared to interact with clients through a wider range of communication channels. New technologies are being adopted by wealth management firms to better communicate with clients and give them the same type of experience they receive in other aspects of their lives, such as using devices like Amazon’s Alexa and video performance reports.

As we continue to expand our presence in the markets outlined above, the number of potential end users who use our solutions increases dramatically. Our potential end user base includes any consumer of financial services on the Internet—and this end user could be a paid user of Envestnet | Yodlee many times over across multiple customers and products. 
Business Model
Envestnet’s business model lends itself to a high degree of recurring and predictable revenues. Envestnet provides asset-based, subscription-based and professional services on a business-to-business-to-consumer (“B2B2C”) basis to financial services clients, whereby customers offer solutions based on our platform to their end users. On a business-to-business (“B2B”) basis, we deliver an open platform to customers and third-party developers through an open API framework. We believe that a number of characteristics contribute to the success of our business model, including:

• | Favorable trends with respect to growth in fee-based assets and need for advanced technology;


• | Recurring and resilient revenue base; and


• | Strong customer retention.

Revenue is generated in the following three categories:
Asset-based recurring revenues
Asset-based recurring revenues primarily consist of fees for providing customers continuous access to platform services through the Company’s uniquely customized platforms. These platform services include investment manager research, portfolio diagnostics, proposal generation, investment model management, rebalancing and trading, portfolio performance reporting and monitoring solutions, billing and back office and middle-office operations and administration and are made available to customers throughout the contractual term from the date the customized platform is launched. 
The asset-based fees the Company earns are generally based upon variable percentages of assets managed or administered on our platforms. The fee percentage varies based on the level and type of services the Company provides to its customers, as well as the values of existing customer accounts. The values of the customer accounts are affected by inflows or outflows of customer funds and market fluctuations.
In approximately 90% of asset‑based fee arrangements, customers are billed at the beginning of each quarter based on the market value of customer assets on our wealth management platforms as of the end of the prior quarter, providing for a high degree of revenue visibility in the current quarter. Revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on changes in asset values, fee rates on those asset values and asset flows. 
11

Subscription-based recurring revenues
Subscription-based recurring revenues primarily consist of fees for providing customers continuous access to the Company’s platform for wealth management and financial wellness. The subscription-based fees generally include fixed fees and or usage-based fees.
Envestnet’s subscription fees are also highly predictable because they are generally established in multi‑year contracts providing longer‑term visibility regarding that portion of total revenues.
Subscription fees vary based on the scope of technology solutions and services being used, and are priced in a variety of constructs based on the size of the business, number of users or number of accounts, and in many cases can increase over time based on the growth of these factors.
Professional Services and Other
Envestnet also generates revenue from professional services for client onboarding, technology development and other project related work.
 Growth Strategy
Envestnet intends to increase revenue and profitability by continuing to pursue the following strategies:

• | Add new enterprise clients;


• | Increase our advisor base;


• | Extend the account base within a given advisor relationship;


• | Expand the services utilized by each advisor or enterprise client, including the cross selling of services across Envestnet’s business lines where applicable;


• | Continue to invest in our technology platforms and data analytics capabilities; and


• | Continue to pursue strategic transactions and other relationships.

Technology Platforms
Our technology platforms feature a three‑tier architecture integrating a Web‑based user interface, an application tier that houses the business logic for all of the platforms’ functionality and a SQL Server databases. The application tier resides behind load balancers which distribute the workload demands across our servers. We believe our technology design allows for significant scalability.
Envestnet undergoes an annual SSAE 16 SOC 1 Type II audit to validate the continued operation of our internal controls on three of its main technology platforms; the Unified Managed Platform, the Unified Managed Platform (Institutional) and Tamarac platforms. The SOC reports confirm design and operating effectiveness of internal controls. We maintain multiple redundancies, back up our databases and safeguard technologies and proprietary information consistent with industry best practices. We also maintain a comprehensive business continuity plan and company‑wide risk assessment program that is consistent with industry best practices and that complies with applicable regulatory requirements.
We have historically made significant investments in platform development in order to enhance and expand our technology platforms and expect to continue to make significant investments in the future. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred technology development costs totaling approximately $52,840, $40,800 and $38,100, respectively. Of these costs, we capitalized approximately $24,000, $12,600 and $8,600, respectively, as internally developed software. We expect to continue focusing our technology development efforts principally on adding features to increase our market competitiveness, enhancements to improve operating efficiency, address regulatory demands and reduce risk and client‑driven requests for new capabilities.
Our proprietary Web‑based platforms provide financial advisors with access to investment solutions and services that address, in one unified, centrally‑hosted platform, based on our knowledge of the industry, the widest range of front‑, middle‑ and back‑office needs in our industry. The “open architecture” design of our technology platforms provide financial advisors with flexibility in terms of the investment solutions and services they access, and configurability in the manner in which the financial advisors utilize particular investment solutions and services. The multi‑tenant platform architecture ensures that this level of flexibility and customization is achieved without requiring us to create unique applications for each client, thereby reducing the need for additional technology personnel and associated expenses. In addition, though our technology platforms 
12

are designed to deliver a breadth of functions, financial advisors are able to select from the various investment solutions and services we offer, without being required to subscribe to or purchase more than what they believe is necessary.
Our data aggregation platform collects a wide variety of end user-permissioned transaction-level data from over 20,000 sources and puts it in a common repository. Envestnet | Yodlee developed robust proprietary technology and processes and established relationships that allow us to curate these data sources and expand our access to new data sources. Over 60% of this data is collected through structured feeds from our FI customers and other FIs. These structured feeds, which consist of either batch files pushed to us or real-time access, provide this critical data efficiently and at scale. Where we do not have direct connections, we capture data using our proprietary information-gathering techniques.
Beyond collecting data, our data aggregation platform performs a data refining process and augments the data with additional information from a variety of other sources. We enrich the data with a proprietary twelve-step process, adding such elements as categorization and merchant identification for bank or credit card account data and security identification, classification and normalization for investment data. As our platform usage grows and is exposed to more users and use cases, the system benefits from machine learning algorithms to better normalize, categorize and process large amounts of data, allowing our network to become more effective, efficient and valuable to our customers. Utilizing this enhanced data, including consolidated data from within our FI customers and account data regarding accounts at other FIs, our data intelligence organizes, analyzes and presents it in a manner that helps our customers offer personalized solutions that enable their consumers to achieve better financial outcomes.
Our analytics platform provides a highly scalable cloud based environment that supports a cost effective and secure way of handling very large data sets, permitting us to develop and test new machine learning algorithms and transform these data sets using the resulting models. The results of the computations can be accessed interactively, as files, or via API access through our data aggregation platform.
Our money movement solutions facilitate payment flows. Our customers can debit and credit consumer and small business accounts in real time or in batches and route payments between accounts (funds transfer), to billers (bill pay), or to other individuals (peer to peer). Designed to be run as a service, our money movement solutions allow us to operate these functionalities in the cloud and quickly adapt to new payment systems. Our payment engine, which is a principal component of our money movement solutions, is a task-based payment processing platform that controls all payment activity across cobrands, originators, processors and billers.
Customers

• | Financial advisors that are working alone or as part of financial advisory firms. Our principal value proposition aimed at financial advisors working alone or as part of financial advisory firms is that our technology platforms allow them to compete effectively with financial advisors employed by large financial institutions. Envestnet can provide these advisors with access to as many or more of the investment solutions and services that are typically available to financial advisors working at the largest firms.


• | Enterprise clients in wealth management. We provide enterprise clients with customized, private‑labeled technology platforms that enable them to support their affiliated financial advisors with a broad range of investment solutions and services.

Sales and Marketing
Our sales teams are organized based on our customers.

• | Our advisor-facing sales teams are field sales professionals supported by internal consultants, organized regionally, responsible for supporting firms and investment advisors who are customers of Envestnet. They help advisors create investment proposals, navigate Envestnet’s wealth management platform and facilitate new business. Our Platform Consulting Group helps advisors utilize Envestnet’s wealth management platform effectively and efficiently. They are subject matter experts on advisor managed programs, unified managed accounts (“UMA”), proposal guidance and site navigation. They provide consulting services to a number of large clients. Envestnet’s PMC Consulting team of investment professionals provide a variety of portfolio and investment management consulting services to RIAs and broker-dealer advisors using Envestnet’s wealth management platform.


• | Enterprise Consultants are the main point of contact for enterprise clients with respect to day-to-day platform matters as well as contractual and pricing efforts. This includes support for advisors and firm management with regard to the overall relationship. The enterprise consultant is essentially the client’s relationship manager who serves as the liaison between the firm and Envestnet.


• | We have a direct sales and pre-sales team servicing the leading global financial institutions. The FI sales team is divided geographically. Each regional sales and pre-sales team is responsible for acquiring new FI customers. Within the North America region, direct sales and pre-sales representatives are further divided into teams that focus on specific accounts, on a named-account basis, depending on size, location, product specialization and/or brand. These sales teams are supported by customer advocacy teams who specialize in customer account management and expansion. Together, sales, pre-sales and customer advocacy representatives are responsible for growing our customer relationships in terms of account penetration (cross-selling additional products and services into the same or additional groups within a FI) and expanding use of existing products and services (increasing usage).


• | We have a direct sales and technical pre-sales team covering financial technology providers in each region. Each regional sales and technical pre-sales team is responsible for acquiring new customers and channel partners. From time to time, we assign specific accounts based upon sales or domain expertise. These teams are supported by a customer success and developer relations team who specialize in customer API integration, and account management and expansion, including services to our channel partners. Together, sales, technical pre-sales, customer success and developer relations representatives are responsible for growing our direct customer and channel partner relationships in terms of account penetration and API usage.

Our marketing efforts are focused on initiatives to drive global company, brand and solutions awareness and significant lead generation and sales acceleration across our whole business. These initiatives include educating the market about our solutions, achieving recognition as the industry leader through awards, speaking engagements, thought leadership articles, data trends and metrics and high profile interviews. We use advertising and public relations to communicate our message to our target markets.
To implement our marketing efforts, we generally employ paid print and online advertisements in a variety of industry publications, as well as promotions that include e-blast campaigns and sponsored webinars for financial advisors. We also partner with independent broker‑dealers on direct mail campaigns targeting such firms’ financial advisors to describe the investment solutions and services that we offer, produce brochures and presentations for financial advisors to use with their clients and we create Internet pages or sites to promote our investment solutions and services. Envestnet | Yodlee employs a variety of integrated sales and marketing initiatives, including hosted demand generation webinars, sponsorship and partnership of key industry conferences, customer and developer-focused events and programs, incubator efforts and other high-profile activities designed to demonstrate thought leadership and engage new audiences in actionable and measurable ways. We employ many tools, including web and social properties, integrated creative campaigns consisting of online advertising, digital content marketing, direct mail and blogs. Envestnet | Yodlee also supports industry analyst relations and media relations activities. In addition, our marketing efforts develop FI customer best practices tools to drive deeper consumer activity and engagement.

Competition
Within wealth management, we compete on the basis of several factors, including:

• | The breadth and quality of investment solutions and services to which we provide access through our technology platform;


• | The number of custodians that are connected through our technology platforms;


• | The price of our investment solutions and services;

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors. 
Regulation
Overview
The financial services industry is among the most extensively regulated industries in the United States. We operate investment advisory, broker-dealer and mutual fund advisory businesses, each of which is subject to a specific regulatory scheme, including regulation at the federal and state level, as well as regulation by self-regulatory organizations and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations of general application.
Our subsidiaries Envestnet Asset Management, Inc. (“EAM”), Envestnet Portfolio Solutions, Inc. (“EPS”) and, FDX Advisors, Inc. and ERS operate investment advisory businesses. These subsidiaries are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as “investment advisers” under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and are regulated thereunder. They may also provide fiduciary services as defined in Section 3(21)(A)(ii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), including acting as an “investment manager” (as defined in Section 3(38) of ERISA). As described further below, many of our investment advisory programs are conducted pursuant to the non-exclusive safe harbor from the definition of an “investment company” provided for under Rule 3a-4 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). If Rule 3a-4 were to cease to be available, or if the SEC were to modify the rule or its interpretation of how the rule is applied, it could have a substantial effect on our business. EAM serves as the investment adviser to two mutual funds. Mutual funds are registered as “investment companies” under the Investment Company Act. The Advisers Act, Investment Company Act and ERISA, together with related regulations and interpretations of the SEC, impose numerous obligations and restrictions on investment advisers and mutual funds, including recordkeeping requirements, limitations on advertising, disclosure and reporting obligations, prohibitions on fraudulent activities and detailed operating requirements, including restrictions on transactions between an adviser and its clients, and between a mutual fund and its advisers and affiliates. The fiduciary obligations of investment advisers to their clients require advisers to, among other things, consider the suitability of the investment products and advice they provide, seek “best execution” for their clients’ securities transactions, conduct due diligence on third-party products offered to clients, consider the appropriateness of the adviser’s fees and provide extensive and ongoing disclosure to clients. The application of these 
15

requirements to wrap fee programs is particularly complex and the SEC has in the past scrutinized firms’ compliance with these requirements. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose fines and sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act and has the power to restrict or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Although we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act and the rules and interpretations promulgated thereunder, our failure to comply with such laws, rules and interpretations could have a material adverse effect on us.
Portfolio Brokerage Services, Inc., (“PBS”), our broker-dealer subsidiary, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC under the Exchange Act, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, PBS is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the securities industry self-regulatory organization that supervises and regulates the conduct and activities of broker-dealers. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of their business, including sales practices, market making and trading among broker-dealers, use and safekeeping of customers’ funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping and the conduct of directors, officers, employees, representatives and associated persons. FINRA and the SEC conduct periodic examinations of the operations of its members, including PBS. Violation of applicable regulations can result in the suspension or revocation of a broker-dealer’s registration, the imposition of censures or fines and the suspension or expulsion of the broker-dealer from FINRA. PBS is subject to minimum net capital requirements under the Exchange Act, SEC and FINRA rules and conducts its business pursuant to the exemption from the SEC’s customer protection rule provided by Rule 15c3-3(k)(2)(i) under the Exchange Act. As of December 31, 2018, PBS was required to maintain a minimum of $100 in net capital and its actual net capital was $1,259.
Envestnet | Yodlee is examined on a periodic basis by various regulatory agencies. For example, Envestnet | Yodlee is a supervised third-party technology service provider subject to multi-agency supervisory examinations in a wide variety of areas based on published guidance by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. These examinations include examinations of Envestnet | Yodlee’s management, acquisition and development activities, support and delivery, IT and disaster preparedness and business recovery planning. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) is the agency in charge of these examinations.
Either as a result of direct regulation or obligations under customer agreements, our subsidiaries are required to comply with certain provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, related to the privacy of consumer information and may be subject to other privacy and data security laws because of the solutions we provide. In addition, numerous regulations have been proposed and are still being written to implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), for enhanced due diligence of the internal systems and processes of companies like ours by their financial institutions customers.
Our subsidiaries are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations that grant supervisory agencies, including the SEC and OCC, broad administrative powers. In the event of a failure to comply with these laws and regulations, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on the permissibility of our regulated subsidiaries and our other subsidiaries to engage in business for specified periods of time, censures, fines and the revocation of registration as a broker-dealer or investment adviser, as applicable. Additionally, the securities laws and other regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries provide for certain private rights of action that could give rise to civil litigation. Any litigation could have significant financial and non-financial consequences including monetary judgments and the requirement to take action or limit activities that could ultimately affect our business.
Many of the laws and regulations to which our subsidiaries are subject are evolving, unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions, and ensuring compliance with them is difficult and costly. We continually develop improvements to our existing products and services as well as new products and services. Many of these improvements or new products and services may implicate regulations to which we may not already be subject or with which we may not have experience. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, including those relating to the activities of our investment adviser, broker-dealer and financial institution clients, may occur that could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business, require significant changes to our systems or solutions or substantially change the way that our clients operate their businesses. Compliance with any new or revised regulatory requirements may divert internal resources, be expensive and time-consuming and may require increased investment in compliance functions or new technologies. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we and our subsidiaries are subject could result in fines, penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our business, or federal or state actions, any of which could significantly harm our reputation, and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

Investment Advisory Program Conducted Under Rule 3a-4
Under the Investment Company Act, an issuer that is engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities may be deemed an “investment company,” in which case the issuer may be subject to registration requirements and regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. In order to provide assurance that certain discretionary investment advisory programs would not be considered investment companies, the SEC adopted Rule 3a-4 under the Investment Company Act, which provides a non-exclusive safe harbor from the definition of an investment company for programs that meet the requirements of the rule. We conduct the following programs pursuant to the Rule 3a-4 safe harbor:

• | Separately managed accounts;


• | Unified managed account portfolios;


• | Mutual fund portfolios and exchange-traded fund portfolios; and


• | Advisor as portfolio manager.

We believe that, to the extent we exercise discretion over accounts in any of these programs, these programs qualify for the safe-harbor because all of the programs have the following characteristics, which are generally required in order for a program to be eligible for the Rule 3a-4 safe harbor:

• | Each client account is managed on the basis of the client’s financial situation, investment objectives and reasonable client-imposed investment restrictions;


• | At the opening of the account, the client’s financial advisor obtains information from the client and provides us with the client’s financial situation, investment objectives and reasonable restrictions;


• | On no less than an annual basis, the client’s financial advisor contacts the client to determine whether there have been any changes in the client’s financial situation or investment objectives, and whether the client wishes to impose any reasonable restrictions on the management of the account or reasonably modify existing restrictions. This information is communicated to us and reflected in our management of client accounts;


• | On a quarterly basis, we or another designated person (in most cases this will be the client’s financial advisor) notify the client to contact us or another designated person if there have been any changes to the client’s financial position or investment objectives or if the client wishes to impose any reasonable restrictions on the management of the account;


• | We, the client’s financial advisor and the manager of the client’s account, all of whom are knowledgeable about the account and its management, are reasonably available to the client for consultation;


• | All of the programs allow each client to impose reasonable restrictions on the management of his or her account;


• | On at least a quarterly basis, the client is provided with a statement containing a description of all activity in the client’s account during the preceding period, including all transactions made on behalf of the account, all contributions and withdrawals made by the client, all fees and expenses charged to the account and the value of the account at the beginning and end of the period; and


• | For all of the programs, each client retains, with respect to all securities and funds in the client’s account, the right to withdraw securities or cash, vote securities, or delegate the authority to vote securities to another person, receive written confirmation or other notification of each securities transaction by the client’s independent custodian and proceed directly as a security holder against the issuer of any security in the client’s account without the obligation to include us or any other client of the program in any such action as a condition precedent to initiating such proceeding.
