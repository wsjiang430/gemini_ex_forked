Item 1. | Business

Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and acquiring technologies that help pharmaceutical companies discover and develop medicines. Over our more than 30 year history, we have employed research technologies such as nuclear receptor assays, high throughput computer screening, formulation science, liver targeted pro-drug technologies and antibody discovery technologies to assist companies in their work toward securing prescription drug approvals. We currently have partnerships and license agreements with over 110 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Over 200 different programs under license with us are currently in various stages of commercialization and development. We have contributed novel research and technologies for approved medicines that treat cancer, osteoporosis, fungal infections and low blood platelets, among others. Our partners have programs currently in clinical development targeting seizure, coma, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, muscle wasting, liver disease, and kidney disease, among others. We have over 1,200 issued patents worldwide.
We have assembled our large portfolio of fully-funded programs either by licensing our own proprietary drug development programs, licensing our platform technologies such as Captisol or OmniAb to partners for use with their proprietary programs, or acquiring existing partnered programs from other companies. Fully-funded programs, which we refer to as "shots on goal," are those for which our partners pay all of the development and commercialization costs. For our internal programs, we generally plan to advance drug candidates through early-stage drug development or clinical proof-of-concept and then seek partners to continue development and potential commercialization.
Our business model creates value for stockholders by providing a diversified portfolio of biotech and pharmaceutical product revenue streams that are supported by an efficient and low corporate cost structure. Our goal is to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the promise of the biotech industry in a profitable, diversified and lower-risk business than a typical biotech company. Our business model is based on doing what we do best: drug discovery, early-stage drug development, product reformulation and partnering. We partner with other pharmaceutical companies to leverage what they do best (late-stage development, regulatory management and commercialization) to ultimately generate our revenue. We believe that focusing on discovery and early-stage drug development while benefiting from our partners’ development and commercialization expertise will reduce our internal expenses and allow us to have a larger number of drug candidates progress to later stages of drug development.
Our revenue consists of three primary elements: royalties from commercialized products, license and milestone payments and sale of Captisol material. In addition to discovering and developing our own proprietary drugs, we selectively pursue acquisitions to bring in new assets, pipelines, and technologies to aid in generating additional potential new revenue streams.

Technologies
A variety of technology platforms that enable elements of drug discovery or development form the basis of our portfolio of fully-funded shots on goal. Platform technologies or individual drugs discovered by Ligand are related to a broad estate of intellectual property that includes over 1,200 patents issued worldwide.
OmniAb Technologies
Our OmniAb technology includes our OmniRat, OmniMouse, OmniFlic and OmniChicken technology platforms for use in discovering fully human antibodies. The OmniRat, OmniMouse, and OmniFlic platforms consist of genetically-engineered transgenic animals that produce a broadly diversified repertoire of antibodies and enable novel fully-human antibody drug discovery and development by our OmniAb partners. Fully-human OmniAb antibodies provide advantages to our partners in that fully-human antibodies have reduced immunogenicity, streamlined development timelines and costs, and accelerated novel antibody discovery. The OmniChicken platform consists of genetically-engineered transgenic chickens which enable the generation of novel antibodies against targets that are not immunogenic in mammals like mice and rats. Currently, more than 40 partners are utilizing OmniAb animals in their drug discovery and development efforts. We acquired these technologies through the acquisition of OMT in January 2016 and Crystal in October 2017.
Vernalis Design Platform (VDP)
The VDP technology leverages our leadership in structure-guided drug discovery in which protein structure, drug fragment screening and modeling are integrated with medicinal chemistry to enable the rapid discovery of novel drugs. The VDP approach establishes structural information via x-ray crystallography and NMR methods and develops reliable assay systems to test biophysical, functional and cellular properties. The VDP has proven success with highly-challenging pharmaceutical targets and has generated a broad portfolio, with over 5,000 novel drug/target complexes determined and over 400 granted and pending patents. We acquired the VDP technology through our acquisition of Vernalis in October of 2018, and maintain state-of-the-art laboratories in Cambridge, UK.
Captisol Technology
Captisol is our patented, uniquely-modified cyclodextrin that is specifically designed to maximize safety, while improving the solubility, stability and bioavailability of APIs. Captisol can enable faster and more efficient development paths for our partners, given its known regulatory acceptance. We maintain both Type IV and Type V DMFs with the FDA. These DMFs contain manufacturing and safety information relating to Captisol that our licensees can reference when developing
 Captisol-enabled drugs. We also filed a DMF in Japan in 2015. Captisol-enabled drugs are marketed in more than 60 countries, and over 40 partners have Captisol-enabled drugs in development.
LTP Technology Platform
The LTP Technology platform is a novel prodrug technology designed to selectively deliver a broad range of pharmaceutical agents to the liver. A prodrug is a biologically inactive compound that can be metabolized in the body to produce an active drug. The LTP Technology works by chemically modifying biologically active molecules into an inactive prodrug, which will be administered to a patient and later activated by specific enzymes in the liver. The technology can be used to improve the safety and/or activity of existing drugs, develop new agents to treat certain liver-related diseases, and treat diseases caused by imbalances of circulating molecules that are controlled by the liver. The technology is especially applicable to metabolic and cardiovascular indications, among others. Currently 3 programs are utilizing the LTP Technology or related platform(s).
SUREtechnology Platform (owned by Selexis)
We acquired economic rights to over 30 SUREtechnology Platform programs from Selexis in two separate transactions in 2013 and 2015, granting us rights to downstream economics on novel biologics and biosimilars programs. The SUREtechnology Platform, developed and owned by Selexis, is a novel technology that improves the way that cells are utilized in the development and manufacturing of recombinant proteins and drugs. The technology is based on novel DNA-based elements that control the dynamic organization of chromatin within mammalian cells and allow for higher and more stable expression of recombinant proteins. The technology creates advantages over traditional approaches including accelerated development and manufacturing times, high yields and increased compound stability.

Selected Commercial Programs
We have multiple programs under license with other companies that have products that are already being commercialized. The following programs represent components of our current portfolio of revenue-generating assets and potential for near-term growth in royalty and other revenue. For information about the royalties owed to us for these programs, see “Royalties” later in this business section.
Promacta (Novartis)
We are party to a license agreement with Novartis related to Promacta, which is an oral medicine that increases the number of platelets in the blood. Platelets are one of the three components of blood and facilitate clotting in the blood. Individuals with low platelets can be at significant risk of bleeding or death. Because of the importance of having a sufficient number of platelets, Promacta has broad potential applicability to a number of medical situations where low platelets exist.
Promacta is currently approved for four indications: (1) the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult and pediatric patients 1 year and older with ITP who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins or splenectomy; (2) thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C to allow the initiation and maintenance of interferon-based therapy; (3) in combination with standard immunosuppressive therapy for the first-line treatment of adult and pediatric patients 2 years and older with SAA; and (4) patients with SAA who have had an insufficient response to immunosuppressive therapy. Promacta was initially approved in 2008, and the product has been generating royalty revenue for Ligand since 2009. Promacta is known as Revolade in the EU and other non-US markets.

Novartis has been and continues to pursue globalization of the brand and currently markets Promacta in multiple countries for the approved indications. Specifically, Promacta is currently approved for ITP in more than 100 countries, for the Hepatitis C-related indication in more than 50 countries, and for post-immunosuppressive therapy SAA indication in more than 45 counties. Approval of Promacta in the U.S. for the first-line treatment of SAA was obtained in November of 2018. | | 
Beyond the currently-approved indications, Novartis has also disclosed that is performing or supporting development activities to expand the brand into new indications, including as a counter measure for the hematopoietic effects of acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS), and has been granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation. As of January 2019, there are 46 open clinical trials related to Promacta (listed as recruiting or open, and not yet recruiting) on the clinicaltrials.gov website. | Promacta (Novartis) | 
 | < $100 million | 4.7%
 | $100 to $200 million | 6.6%
 | $200 to $400 million | 7.5%
 | $400 million to $1.5 billion | 9.4%
 | >$1.5 billion | 9.3%
We are entitled to receive royalties related to Promacta during the life of the relevant patents or following patent expiry, at a reduced rate for ten years from the first commercial sale, whichever is longer, on a country-by-country basis. Novartis has listed a patent in the FDA’s Orange Book for Promacta with an expiration date in 2028, and absent early termination for bankruptcy or material breach, the term of the agreement expires upon expiration of the obligation to pay royalties. There are no remaining milestones to be paid under the agreement. | | 

Kyprolis (Amgen)
Ligand supplies Captisol to Amgen for use with Kyprolis, and granted Amgen an exclusive product-specific license under our patent rights with respect to Captisol. Kyprolis is formulated with Ligand’s Captisol technology and is approved in the United States for the following:
•In combination with dexamethasone or combination with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three lines of therapy.
•As a single agent for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one or more lines of therapy.

Kyprolis is also approved in multiple countries outside the U.S. and Amgen continues to invest significantly in Kyprolis to further expand its label and geography. Amgen’s obligation to pay royalties does not expire until four years after the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering Captisol. Our patents and applications relating to the Captisol component of Kyprolis are not expected to expire until 2033. | Kyprolis (Amgen) |

Evomela (Spectrum and CASI)
Ligand supplies Captisol to Spectrum for use with Evomela, which is a Captisol-enabled melphalan IV formulation. The FDA approved Evomela for use in two indications:
•A high-dose conditioning treatment prior to ASCT in patients with multiple myeloma. 
•For the palliative treatment of patients with multiple myeloma for whom oral therapy is not appropriate.
Evomela has been granted Orphan Designation by the FDA for use as a high-dose conditioning regimen for patients with multiple myeloma undergoing ASCT. The Evomela formulation avoids the use of propylene glycol, which has been reported to cause renal and cardiac side-effects that limit the ability to deliver higher quantities of therapeutic compounds. The use of the Captisol technology to reformulate melphalan is anticipated to allow for longer administration durations and slower infusion rates, potentially enabling clinicians to safely achieve a higher dose intensity of pre-transplant chemotherapy.
Under the terms of the license agreement, we granted an exclusive license to Spectrum under our patent rights to Captisol relating to the product. We are eligible to receive over $50 million in potential milestone payments under this agreement and royalties on global net sales of the Captisol-enabled melphalan product. Spectrum’s obligation to pay royalties will expire at the end of the life of the relevant patents or when a competing product is launched, whichever is earlier, but in no event within ten years of the commercial launch. Our patents and applications relating to the Captisol component of melphalan are not expected to expire until 2033. Absent early termination, the agreement will terminate upon expiration of the obligation to pay royalties. The agreement may be terminated by either party for an uncured material breach or unilaterally by Spectrum by prior written notice.
Spectrum sub-licensed Evomela rights for Greater China to CASI in 2014. In December 2018, CASI announced China marketing approval of Evomela and a plan to launch the drug in China in 2019.

Manufacturing
We contract with a third party manufacturer, Hovione, for Captisol production. Hovione is a global supplier with over 50 years of experience in the development and manufacture of APIs and Drug Product Intermediates. Hovione operates FDA-inspected sites in the United States, Macau, Ireland and Portugal. Manufacturing operations for Captisol are currently performed at two sites, in both of Hovione's Portugal and Ireland facilities with distribution operations also performed from Hovione's Portugal and Ireland sites. Additionally, we also store and distribute Captisol from a subterranean warehouse controlled by us and located in Kansas. We believe we maintain adequate inventory of Captisol to meet our current and future partner needs.
In the event of a Captisol supply interruption, we are permitted to designate and, with Hovione’s assistance, qualify one or more alternate suppliers. If the supply interruption continues beyond a designated period, we may terminate the agreement. In addition, if Hovione cannot supply our requirements of Captisol due to an uncured force majeure event, we may also obtain Captisol from a third party and have previously identified such parties.
The current term of the agreement with Hovione is through December 2024. The agreement will automatically renew for successive two year renewal terms unless either party gives written notice of its intention to terminate the agreement no less than two years prior to the expiration of the initial term or renewal term. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach or bankruptcy of the other party or an extended force majeure event. We may terminate the agreement for extended supply interruption, regulatory action related to Captisol or other specified events. We have ongoing minimum purchase commitments under the agreement.
For further discussion of these items, see below under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Competition
Some of the drugs we and our licensees and partners are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our competitors.
Our Captisol business may face competition from other suppliers of similar cyclodextrin excipients or other technologies that are aimed to increase solubility or stability of APIs. Our OmniAb antibody technology faces competition from suppliers of other transgenic animal systems that are also available for antibody drug discovery.
Our competitive position also depends upon our ability to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes. For a discussion of the risks associated with competition, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Government Regulation
The research and development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. We and our partners, depending on specific activities performed, are subject to these regulations. In the United States, pharmaceuticals are subject to regulation by both federal and various state authorities, including the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act govern the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products and there are often comparable regulations that apply at the state level. There are similar regulations in other countries as well. For both currently marketed and products in development, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in delays, the suspension of regulatory approvals, as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect on us or our partners. For a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to our inventions that are considered important to the development of our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Patents are issued or pending for the following key products or product families. The scope and type of patent protection provided by each patent family is defined by the claims in the various patents. The nominal patent expiration dates have been provided. The actual patent term may vary by jurisdiction and depend on a number of factors including potential patent term adjustments, patent term extensions, and terminal disclaimers. For each product or product family, the patents and/or applications referred to are in force in at least the United States, and for most products and product families, the patents and/or applications are also in force in European jurisdictions, Japan and other jurisdictions.
Promacta
Patents covering Promacta are owned by Novartis. The United States patent listed in the FDA’s Orange Book relating to Promacta with the latest expiration date is not expected to expire until 2027. Six months of additional exclusivity to each of the U.S. expiration dates listed in the table has been granted due to pediatric studies conducted by GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK), thereby taking the latest expiration date into 2028. The type of patent protection (e.g., composition of matter or use) and the expiration date for each unexpired patent listed in the Orange Book are provided in the following table. In addition, certain related patents in the commercially important jurisdictions of Europe and Japan are identified in the following table.
