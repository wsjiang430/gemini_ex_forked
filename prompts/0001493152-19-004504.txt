Item 1. Business.
Business Overview
 
Barfresh is a leader in the creation, manufacturing and distribution of ready to blend frozen beverages. The current portfolio of products includes smoothies, shakes and frappes. Products are packaged in two distinct formats.
 
The Company’s original single serve format features portion controlled and ready to blend beverage ingredient packs or “beverage packs”. The beverage packs contain all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage, including the base (either sorbet, frozen yogurt or ice cream), real fruit pieces, juices and ice – five ounces of water are added before blending.
 
The Company’s bulk “Easy Pour” format also contains all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage, packaged in gallon containers in a concentrated formula that is mixed “one to one” with water. The Company has a “no sugar added” version of the bulk “Easy Pour” format that is specifically targeted for the USDA national school meal program, including the School Breakfast Program, the National School Lunch Program, and Smart Snacks in Schools Program. The Company is currently in contract to sell its bulk Easy Pour products into over three hundred schools. In addition, the Company received approval from the United States Defense Logistics Agency (“DLA”) to sell its smoothie products into all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, and is currently in contract with and selling its bulk Easy Pour products into over one hundred military bases in the United States.
 
Domestic and international patents and patents pending are owned by Barfresh, as well as related trademarks for all of the single serve products. Patent rights have been granted in 13 jurisdictions including the United States. In addition, the Company has purchased all of the trademarks related to the patented products.
 
The Company conducts sales through several channels, including National Accounts, Regional Accounts, and Broadline Distributors. Barfresh’s primary broadline distribution arrangement is through an exclusive nationwide agreement with Sysco Corporation (“Sysco”), the U.S.’s largest broadline distributor, which was entered into during July 2014.


Pursuant to that agreement, all Barfresh products are included in Sysco’s national core selection of beverage items, making Barfresh its exclusive single-serve, pre-portioned beverage provider. The agreement is mutually exclusive; however, Barfresh may also sell the products to other foodservice distributors, but only to the extent required for such foodservice distributors to service multi-unit chain operators with at least 20 units and where Sysco is not such multi- unit chain operator’s nominated distributor for our products. On October 2, 2017, the Sysco agreement was extended for an additional two year period, and expanded to cover bulk easy pour products, on a non-exclusive basis.
 
During 2016 and 2017 the Company announced that it had signed supply agreements with several of the major global on-site foodservice operators. On March 8, 2018, the Company announced that it had signed a new supply agreement with one of the largest of these foodservice operators, for exclusive distribution of four of Barfresh’s single serve sku’s. On November 14, 2018, the Company announced that it had received approval for multiple products to be rolled out to a national restaurant chain with over 2,500 locations.


On October 26, 2015, Barfresh signed a five year agreement with PepsiCo North America Beverages, a division of PepsiCo, to become its exclusive sales representative within the food service channel to present Barfresh’s line of ready-to-blend smoothies and frozen beverages throughout the United States and Canada. Through this agreement, Barfresh’ products are included as part of PepsiCo’s offerings to its significant customer base. The agreement facilitates access to potential National customer accounts, through introductions provided by PepsiCo’s one-thousand plus person foodservice sales team. Barfresh products have become part of PepsiCo’s customer presentations at national trade shows and similar venues.
 
Barfresh utilizes contract manufacturers to manufacture all of its products in the United States. Production lines are currently operational at two locations. The first location is in Salt Lake City, which currently produces both bulk easy pour and single serve products. Annual production capacity with this contract manufacturer is 14 million units per year. The second location is with Yarnell Operations, LLC., a subsidiary of Shulze and Burch, located in Arkansas. The Yarnell’s agreement, which was signed during February, 2016, and secures the capacity to ramp up to an incremental production capacity of 100 million units. Yarnell’s location enhances the company’s ability to efficiently move product throughout the supply chain to destinations in the eastern United States, home to many of the country’s large foodservice outlets.

Reorganization and Recapitalization
 
During January, 2012, the Company entered into a series of transactions pursuant to which Barfresh Inc., a Colorado corporation (“Barfresh NV”), was acquired, spun-out prior operations to the former principal shareholder, completed a private offering of securities for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1,000,000, conducted a four for one forward stock split and changed the name of the Company. The following describes the steps of this reorganization:

● | Acquisition of Barfresh NV. We acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Barfresh NV in exchange for the issuance of 37,333,328 shares of our $0.000001 par value common stock pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement between us, our former principal shareholder, Barfresh NV and the former shareholders of Barfresh NV. As a result of this transaction, Barfresh NV became our wholly owned subsidiary and the former shareholders of Barfresh NV became our controlling shareholders. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Spinout of prior business. Immediately prior to the acquisition of Barfresh NV, we spun-out our previous business operations to a former officer, director and principal shareholder, in exchange for all of the shares of our common stock held by that person. Such shares were cancelled immediately following the acquisition. 
● | Financing transaction. Immediately following the acquisition of Barfresh, we sold an aggregate of 1,333,332 shares of our common stock and five-year warrants to purchase 1,333,332 shares of common stock at a per share exercise price of $1.50 in a private offering for gross proceeds of $999,998, less expenses of $26,895. 
● | Change of name. Subsequent to the merger, we changed the name of the Company from Moving Box Inc. to Barfresh Food Group Inc. Barfresh Food Group Inc., has two direct subsidiaries; Barfresh Corporation, Inc, (formerly known as Smoothie, Inc.) and Barfresh, Inc. 
● | Forward stock split. Subsequent to the merger, we conducted a four for one forward stock split of the Company’s common stock. 

Products
 
The Company’s products are made in two formats. The first is in portion controlled single serving beverage ingredient packs, suitable for smoothies, shakes and frappes that can also be utilized for cocktails and mocktails. These packs contain all of the ingredients necessary to make a smoothie, shake or frappe, including the ice. Simply add water, empty the packet into a blender, blend and serve. The second format is the bulk “Easy Pour” format. The Company’s bulk “Easy Pour” format also contains all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage, packaged in gallon containers in a concentrated formula that is mixed “one to one” with water.

Competition
 
There is significant competition in the smoothie market at both the consumer purchasing level and also the product level.
 
The competition at the consumer level is primarily between specialized juice bars (e.g. Jamba Juice) and major fast casual and fast food restaurant chains (such as McDonalds). Barfresh does not compete specifically at this level but intends to supply its product to customers that fall within these segments to enable them to compete for consumer demand.
 
There may also be new entrants to the smoothie market that may alter the current competitor landscape.
 
The existing competition from a product perspective can be separated into three categories:
 
● Specialized juice bar products: The product is made in-store and each ingredient is added separately.
 
● Syrup based products: The fruit puree is supplied in bulk and not portion controlled for each smoothie. These types of products still require the addition of juice, milk or water and/or yogurt and ice. While there are a number of competitors for this style of product, the two dominant competitors are Island Oasis and Minute Maid.
 
● Portion pack products: These products contain only the fruit and yogurt and require the addition of juice or milk and ice. The dominant competitor is General Mills’ Yoplait Smoothies.
 
The Company believes that its single serve products afford a very significant competitive advantage based on ease of use, portion control, premium quality, and minimal capital investment required to enable a customer to begin to carry Barfresh beverage products. The Company also believes that its bulk “Easy Pour” product represents an attractive alternative delivery method for customers that serve high volume locations, where speed of service over extended periods is a critical requirement. The Company has recently launched a “no sugar added” version of the bulk “Easy Pour” format that is specifically targeted for the USDA national school meal program, including the School Breakfast Program, the National School Lunch Program, and Smart Snacks in Schools Program.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Barfresh owns the domestic and intellectual property rights to its products’ sealed pack of ingredients used in its single serve products.
 
In November 2011, the Company acquired patent applications filed in the United States (Patent Application number 11/660415) and Canada (Patent Application number 2577163) from certain related parties. The United States patent was originally filed on December 4, 2007 and it was granted during August of 2017. The Canadian patent was originally filed on August 16, 2005 and it was granted on May 27, 2014.
 
On October 15, 2013, the Company acquired all of the related international patent rights, which were filed pursuant to the Patent Cooperation Treaty, have been granted in 13 jurisdictions and are pending in the remainder of the jurisdictions that have signed the PCT. In addition, the Company purchased all of the trademarks related to the patented products.
 
Governmental Approval and Regulation
 
The Company is not aware of the need for any governmental approvals of its products.
 
The Company utilizes contract manufacturers. Before entering into any manufacturing contracts, the Company determines that the manufacturer meets all government requirements.
 
Environmental Laws
 
The Company does not believe that it will be subject to any environmental laws, either state or federal. Any laws concerning manufacturing will be the responsibility of the contract manufacturer.
