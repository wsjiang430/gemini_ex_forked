 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
     Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” or “Lamb Weston”), along with its joint venture partners, is a leading global producer, distributor, and marketer of value-added frozen potato products and is headquartered in Eagle, Idaho. We, along with our joint venture partners, are the number one supplier of value-added frozen potato products in North America. We are also a leading supplier of value-added frozen potato products internationally, with a strong and growing presence in high-growth emerging markets. We, along with our joint venture partners, offer a broad product portfolio to a diverse channel and customer base in over 100 countries. French fries represent the majority of our value-added frozen potato product portfolio.
     We were organized as a Delaware corporation in July 2016, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Conagra Brands, Inc. (formerly, ConAgra Foods, Inc., “Conagra”). On November 9, 2016, we separated from Conagra and became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by Conagra of 100% of our outstanding common stock to Conagra stockholders (“Separation” or “spinoff”). As a result of the Separation, approximately 146 million shares of our common stock were distributed on November 9, 2016, to Conagra stockholders. On November 10, 2016, our common stock began trading under the ticker symbol “LW” on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”).
     In connection with the Separation, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and several other agreements with Conagra, including a transition services agreement, tax matters agreement, employee matters agreement, and trademark license agreement. These agreements governed the relationship between us and Conagra following the Separation and provided for the allocation of various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations of the parties. These agreements also included arrangements for transition services provided by Conagra to Lamb Weston. For a discussion of these agreements, see the section entitled “Relationship with ConAgra After the Spinoff” in our registration statement on Form 10, as amended, as filed with the SEC on October 17, 2016 (“Form 10”), and Note 14, Related Party Transactions,

of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K. In April 2018, we concluded our transition services agreement with Conagra.
     In connection with the Separation, Conagra transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of the Lamb Weston business to us. Combined financial statements for Lamb Weston for periods prior to the Separation were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from Conagra’s consolidated financial statements and accounting records. The combined financial statements for Lamb Weston contained in this report for periods prior to the Separation reflect our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, and cash flows as our business was operated as part of Conagra prior to the Separation and include allocations for a portion of Conagra’s shared corporate general and administrative expenses. The combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as of dates and for periods prior to the Separation may not be indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate stand-alone public company during the periods presented, nor are they indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be in the future. Information related to the Separation and its effect on our financial statements are discussed throughout this Form 10‑K.
     Following the Separation, our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. 
     Segments
     We have four reportable segments: Global, Foodservice, Retail, and Other. For segment financial information see Note 15, Segments, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10‑K.     Global
     Our Global segment includes branded and private label frozen potato products sold in North America and international markets. This segment includes the top 100 North American based restaurant chains and international customers comprised of global and regional restaurant chains, foodservice distributors, and retailers. We have included non-U.S. and non-Canadian retail and foodservice customers in the Global segment due to efficiencies associated with coordinating sales to all customer types within specific markets, as well as due to these customers’ smaller scale and dependence on local economic conditions. The Global segment’s product portfolio includes frozen potatoes, sweet potatoes, and appetizers sold under the Lamb Weston brand, as well as many customer labels.     Foodservice
     Our Foodservice segment includes branded and private label frozen potato products sold throughout the United States and Canada. The Foodservice segment’s primary products are frozen potatoes, sweet potatoes, commercial ingredients, and appetizers sold under the Lamb Weston brand, as well as many customer labels. Our products are sold primarily to commercial distributors, restaurant chains outside the top 100 North American based restaurant chains, and non-commercial channels.     Retail
     Our Retail segment includes consumer facing retail branded and private label frozen potato products sold primarily to grocery, mass merchants, club, and specialty retailers. The Retail segment’s primary products are frozen potatoes and sweet potato items sold under our owned or licensed brands, including Grown in Idaho and Alexia, other licensed equities comprised of brand names of major North American restaurant chains, and the retailers’ own brands.

 Other
     The Other reporting segment primarily includes our vegetable and dairy businesses. 
     Joint Venture Relationships
     We conduct business through two unconsolidated joint ventures and include our share of the earnings of these affiliates as equity method investment earnings in our combined and consolidated financial statements based on our economic ownership interest in each of these joint ventures. These two joint ventures produce and market value-added frozen potato products for our customers:
· | We hold a fifty percent ownership interest in Lamb-Weston/Meijer v.o.f. (“Lamb-Weston/Meijer”), a joint venture with Meijer Frozen Foods B.V. Lamb-Weston/Meijer, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, manufactures and sells frozen potato products principally in Europe.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We hold a fifty percent ownership interest in Lamb-Weston/RDO Frozen (“Lamb-Weston/RDO”), a potato processing venture with RDO Frozen Co. We provide all sales and marketing services to Lamb-Weston/RDO and receive a fee for these services based on a percentage of the net sales of the venture.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      On November 2, 2018, we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “BSW Agreement”) with Ochoa Ag Unlimited Foods, Inc. (“Ochoa”) to acquire the remaining 50.01% interest in Lamb Weston BSW, LLC, a potato processing joint venture (“Lamb Weston BSW”). Prior to entering into the BSW Agreement, we were the primary beneficiary of Lamb Weston BSW, a variable interest entity, and accordingly, we consolidated the financial statements of Lamb Weston BSW and deducted 50.01% of the operating results of the noncontrolling interests to arrive at “Net income attributable to Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.” on our Combined and Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Our Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings include 100% of Lamb Weston BSW’s earnings beginning November 2, 2018. For more information, see Note 7, Investments in Joint Ventures, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. 
     Sales, Distribution and Customers
     We benefit from strong relationships with a diverse set of customers. We sell our products through a combined network of internal sales personnel and independent brokers, agents, and distributors to chain restaurants, wholesale, grocery, mass merchants, club, specialty retailers, and foodservice distributors and institutions, including businesses, educational institutions, independent restaurants, regional chain restaurants, and convenience stores. We have long-tenured relationships with leading quick service and fast casual restaurants, global foodservice distributors, large grocery retailers, and mass merchants.
     Our largest customer, McDonald’s Corporation, accounted for approximately 10% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019 and 11% of our consolidated net sales in both fiscal 2018 and 2017. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017 consolidated net sales. Accounts receivable from one customer accounted for 12% of our consolidated accounts receivable at May 27, 2018. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated accounts receivable as of May 26, 2019.
    
Research and Development
     We leverage our research and development resources for both growth and efficiency initiatives. We seek to drive growth through innovation by creating new products, enhancing the quality of existing products, and participating in joint menu planning exercises with our customers. We also emphasize sustainability in our research and development activities and continue to drive processing innovations aimed at reducing waste and water usage and improving food safety. Research

and development expenses were $15.4 million, $13.5 million, and $10.6 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
     Trademarks, Licenses and Patents
     Our trademarks are material to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the United States and most other geographic markets where the related food items are sold. Depending on the country, trademarks generally remain valid for as long as they are in use and their registrations are maintained. Trademark registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. Our significant trademarks include: Lamb Weston, Lamb’s Supreme, Lamb Weston Seeing Possibilities in Potatoes (and design), Lamb’s Seasoned, LW Private Reserve, Stealth Fries, and Sweet Things. We also sell certain products, such as Grown in Idaho and Alexia, which we license from third parties. 
     We own numerous patents worldwide. We consider our portfolio of patents, patent applications, patent licenses, proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations. Patents, issued or applied for, cover inventions, including packaging, manufacturing processes, equipment, formulations, and designs. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. While we consider our patent portfolio to be material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business. 
     Raw Materials and Packaging
     Our primary raw materials are potatoes, edible oils, and packaging. We source a significant amount of our raw potatoes under both strategic, long-term grower relationships and shorter-term annual contracts. In the United States, most of the potato crop used in our products is grown in Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. For Lamb-Weston/Meijer, European growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. We also have growing regions in China and Australia. We believe that the grower networks to which we have access provide a sufficient source of raw potato inputs year-to-year. We source edible oils through strategic relationships with key suppliers, and we source energy and packaging materials through multiple suppliers under a variety of agreement types.
     The prices paid for these raw materials, as well as other raw materials used in making our products, generally reflect factors such as weather, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, tariffs, and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply.
     From time to time, we have faced increased costs for our significant raw materials, packaging and energy inputs. We seek to mitigate higher input costs through long-term relationships, contract strategies, and hedging activities where an active market for an input exists, as well as through our productivity and pricing initiatives. 
     Manufacturing
     We operate 17 manufacturing facilities for our products. See "Item 2. Properties" for more information about our manufacturing facilities.
     In addition to our own manufacturing facilities, we source a portion of our products under “co-packing” agreements, a common industry practice in which manufacturing is outsourced to other companies. We regularly evaluate our co-packing arrangements to ensure the most cost-effective manufacturing of our products and to utilize company-owned manufacturing facilities most effectively.

International Operations 
     At May 26, 2019, we had operations in twelve countries, with manufacturing and processing facilities in four countries. Foreign net sales, including sales by domestic segments to customers located outside of the United States, were approximately $742.7 million, $665.8 million, and $663.5 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Our long-lived assets located outside of the United States are not significant. See Note 15, Segments, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for additional information on our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Also see “Item 2. Properties,” for more information on our manufacturing and other facilities. For a discussion of risks related to our operations outside the United States, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.      Backlog 
     We manufacture primarily to fill customer orders from finished goods inventories. While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders due to the seasonal nature of our manufacturing activities and associated inventory, such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales, and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant.     Competition
     The value-added frozen potato products industry in North America, Europe and other international markets is highly competitive. Competitors include large North American and European frozen potato product companies that compete globally, as well as local and regional companies. Significant competitors include McCain Foods Limited, J.R. Simplot Company, Cavendish Farms Corporation, The Kraft Heinz Company, Clarebout Potatoes NV, Aviko B.V., Agristo NV, Farm Frites International B.V. and Mydibel S.A. Some of our competitors are larger and have substantially more financial, sales and marketing, and other resources. We compete with producers of similar products on the basis of, among other things, customer service, value, product innovation, product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, price, and the ability to identify and satisfy customer preferences. The markets in which we operate are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits” of this Form 10-K.     Seasonality
     Our product contribution margin percentage, inventory levels, net sales and cash flows are affected by seasonality. In general, our product contribution margin percentage tends to be highest in our fiscal third quarter, reflecting the benefit of freshly-harvested potatoes. We typically harvest potatoes in the Pacific Northwest of the United States in July through October, which is primarily in our fiscal second quarter. Freshly-harvested potatoes process more efficiently in our production lines and are not subject to storage or secondary transport costs. We typically hold about 60 days of finished goods inventory on a first-in-first-out basis, so the relatively favorable costs primarily incurred from our fiscal second quarter harvest flow through our income statement in our fiscal third quarter. Inventory levels also tend to be higher in our fiscal third quarter, requiring more working capital at that time. In general, net sales and cash flows tend to be higher in our fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting customer and consumer buying patterns.     Employees 
     As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately 7,600 employees, excluding our joint ventures. Approximately 700 of these employees work outside of the United States. Approximately 32% of our hourly employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements on terms that we believe are typical for the industry in which we operate. Most of the union workers at our facilities are represented under contracts that expire at various times throughout the next several years. Approximately 32% expire in fiscal 2020. As these agreements expire, we believe they will be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to us.

     Food Safety and Labeling
     We are subject to extensive regulation, including, among other things, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Food Safety Modernization Act, the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).
