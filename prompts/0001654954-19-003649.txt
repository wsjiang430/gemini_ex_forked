 QuoteMedia has developed a full range of financial data and market information solutions which are licensed to our clients on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis.

QMod is an extensible market data component JavaScript library used to deliver market data content to Web platforms powered by JSON back-ends. With extensibility in mind, QMod can be utilized to build custom applications on demand for clients as well as continue to improve existing and new components with ease. The resulting widgets are mobile-ready, because they automatically re-size and optimize based on the type of device they are viewed on – whether a laptop, tablet, or any model of mobile phone. And, unlike competitive products, QMod is SEO friendly, providing self-generating, automatically updating content that is optimized for search engine indexing – whereas the content and associated links delivered through most competitors’ widgets are essentially invisible to search engine web crawlers.

 QuoteMedia offers three leading edge portfolio managements systems: Quotestream™ Desktop and Mobile; Quotestream™ Professional; and a Web Portfolio Management product.
