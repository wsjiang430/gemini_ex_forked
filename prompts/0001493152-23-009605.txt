Item 1. Business.
Overview of Yoshiharu
 
Yoshiharu is a fast-growing Japanese restaurant operator and was borne out the idea of introducing the modernized Japanese dining experience to customers all over the world. Specializing in Japanese ramen, Yoshiharu gained recognition as a leading ramen restaurant in Southern California within six months of our 2016 debut and has continued to expand our top-notch restaurant service across Southern California, currently operating 8 restaurants with an additional 5 new restaurant stores under construction/development and an additional 6 restaurant stores expected to open in 2023. We take pride in our warm, hearty, smooth, and rich bone broth, which is slowly boiled for over 12 hours. Customers can taste and experience supreme quality and deep flavors. Combining the broth with the fresh, savory, and highest-quality ingredients, Yoshiharu serves the perfect, ideal ramen, as well as offers customers a wide variety of sushi rolls, bento menu and other favorite Japanese cuisine. Our acclaimed signature Tonkotsu Black Ramen has become a customer favorite with its slow cooked pork bone broth and freshly made, tender chashu (braised pork belly).
 
Our mission is to bring our Japanese ramen and cuisine to the mainstream, by providing a meal that customers find comforting. Since the inception of the business, we have been making our own ramen broth and other key ingredients such as pork chashu and flavored eggs from scratch, whereby upholding the quality and taste of our foods, including the signature texture and deep, rich flavor of our handcrafted broth. Moreover, we believe that slowly cooking the bone broth makes it high in collagen and rich in nutrients. Yoshiharu also strives to present food that is not only healthy, but also affordable. We feed, entertain and delight our customers, with our active kitchens and bustling dining rooms providing happy hours, student and senior discounts, and special holiday events. As a result of our vision, customers can comfortably enjoy our food in a friendly and welcoming atmosphere.
 
In September 2022, the Company consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 2,940,000 shares of its class A common stock at a public offering price of $4.00 per share, generating gross proceeds of $11,760,000. Net proceeds from the IPO were approximately $10.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $1.5 million.
 
The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 441,000 additional shares (equal to 15% of the shares of class A common stock sold in the IPO) to cover over-allotments, if any, which the underwriters did not exercise. In addition, the Company issued to the representative of the underwriters warrants to purchase a number of shares of class A common stock equal to 5.0% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock sold in the IPO (including shares of Class A common stock sold upon exercise of the over-allotment option). The representative’s warrants will be exercisable at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, during the four-and-½-year period commencing six months from the date of commencement of the sales of the shares of Class A common stock in connection with the IPO, at an initial exercise price per share of $5.00 (equal to 125% of the initial public offering price per share of class A common stock). No representative’s warrants have been exercised.
 
On September 9, 2022, the Company’s stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “YOSH.”  
 
Supply Chain Disruption and Inflation
 
Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs, especially in light of recent supply chain disruptions. We believe we have experienced higher costs due to increased commodity prices and challenges sourcing our supplies due in part to global supply chain disruptions. Although historically and as of December 31, 2022, global supply chain disruptions have not materially adversely affected our business, a substantial increase in the cost of, or inability to procure, the food products most critical to our menu, such as canola oil, rice, meats, fish and other seafood, as well as fresh vegetables, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results from operations. Because we provide moderately priced food, we may choose not to, or may be unable to, pass along commodity price increases to consumers. These potential changes in supply costs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Historically and as of the date hereof, inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations. Severe increases in inflation, however, could affect the global and U.S. economies and could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, future volatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions and recessionary periods or periods of significant inflation may adversely impact consumer spending at our restaurants, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such effects can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth. To the extent that we are unable to offset such cost inflation through increased menu prices or increased efficiencies in our operations and cost savings, there could be a negative impact on our business, sales and margin performance, net income, cash flows and the trading price of our common shares. We have been able to offset to some extent these inflationary and other cost pressures through actions such as increasing menu prices and supply chain initiatives, however, we expect these inflationary and other cost pressures to continue into year 2023.
 
Our Strengths
 
Experienced Management Team Dedicated to Growth.
 
Our team is led by experienced and passionate senior management who are committed to our mission. We are led by our Chief Executive Officer, James Chae. Mr. Chae founded Yoshiharu in 2016 and has helped grow the business since that time. Mr. Chae leads a team of talented professionals with deep financial, operational, culinary, and real estate experience.
Compelling Value Proposition with Broad Appeal.
 
Guests can enjoy our signature ramen dishes or select from our variety of fresh sushi rolls, bento, and other Japanese cuisine. The high-quality dishes at affordable prices are the result of our efficient operations. In addition, we believe our commitment to high-quality and fresh ingredients in our food is at the forefront of current dining trends as customers continue to seek healthy food options.
Attractive Restaurant-Level Economics.
 
At Yoshiharu, we believe our rapid customer turnover, combined with our ability to deliver in 2 major dayparts with lunch and dinner, allows for robust and efficient sales in each of our restaurants. Our average unit volume (“AUV”, as defined herein) was $1.2 million in 2021 and $1.2 million in 2022.
Quality of Food and Excellence in Customer Service.
 
We place a premium on serving high-quality, authentic Japanese cuisine. We believe in customer convenience and satisfaction and have created strong, loyal and repeat customers who help expand the Yoshiharu network to their friends, family and co-workers.
 
Flexibility to Pivot to Online and Delivery.
 
During the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, we were able to efficiently transition from primarily in-store sales to a diversified mix of channels including takeout and delivery. As our customers’ habits adapt post-pandemic, we intend to invest further in our delivery and takeout programs, which currently rely on third-party providers. .

Our Growth Strategies
 
Pursue New Restaurant Development.
 
We have pursued a disciplined new corporate owned growth strategy. Having expanded our concept and operating model across varying restaurant sizes and geographies, we plan to leverage our expertise opening new restaurants to fill in existing markets and expand into new geographies. While we currently aim to achieve in excess of 100% annual unit growth rate over the next three to five years, we cannot predict the time period of which we can achieve any level of restaurant growth or whether we will achieve this level of growth at all. Our ability to achieve new restaurant growth is impacted by a number of risks and uncertainties beyond our control, including those described under the caption “Risk Factors.” In particular, see “Risk Factors—Our long-term success is highly dependent on our ability to successfully identify and secure appropriate sites and timely develop and expand our operations in existing and new markets” for specific risks that could impede our ability to achieve new restaurant growth in the future. We believe there is a significant opportunity to employ this strategy to open additional restaurants in our existing markets and in new markets with similar demographics and retail environments.
Deliver Consistent Comparable Restaurant Sales Growth.
 
We have achieved positive comparable restaurant sales growth in recent periods. We believe we will be able to generate future comparable restaurant sales growth by growing traffic through increased brand awareness, consistent delivery of a satisfying dining experience, new menu offerings, and restaurant renovations. We will continue to manage our menu and pricing as part of our overall strategy to drive traffic and increase average check. We are also exploring initiatives to grow sales of alcoholic beverages at our restaurants, including the potential of a larger format restaurant with a sake bar concept. In addition to the strategies stated above, we expect to initiate sales of franchises in 2023  .
Increase Profitability.
 
We have invested in our infrastructure and personnel, which we believe positions us to continue to scale our business operations. As we continue to grow, we expect to drive higher profitability both at a restaurant-level and corporate-level by taking advantage of our increasing buying power with suppliers and leveraging our existing support infrastructure. Additionally, we believe we will be able to optimize labor costs at existing restaurants as our restaurant base matures and AUVs increase. We believe that as our restaurant base grows, our general and administrative costs will increase at a slower rate than our sales.
Heighten Brand Awareness.
 
We intend to continue to pursue targeted local marketing efforts and plan to increase our investment in advertising. We also are exploring the development of instant ramen noodles which we would distribute through retail channels. We intend to explore partnerships with grocery retailers to provide for small-format Yoshiharu kiosks in stores to promote a limited selection of Yoshiharu cuisine.
Experienced Management Team Dedicated to Growth.
 
Our team is led by experienced and passionate senior management who are committed to our mission. We are led by our Chief Executive Officer, James Chae. Mr. Chae founded Yoshiharu in 2016 and leads a team of talented professionals with deep financial, operational, culinary, and real estate experience.
Properties
 
As of June 30, 2022, we operated 7 restaurants in California and opened 1 new location in July 2022 in California. We operate a variety of restaurant formats, including in-line and end-cap restaurants located in retail centers of varying sizes. Our restaurants currently average approximately 1,578 square feet. We lease the property for our corporate offices and all of the properties on which we operate our restaurants.

*1 Opened in July 2022.
 *2 Under construction.
 
We are obligated under non-cancelable leases for the majority of our restaurants, as well as our corporate offices. The majority of our restaurant leases have lease terms of 10 years, inclusive of customary extensions which are at the option of the Company. Our restaurant leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance charges, and other operating costs. Some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we generally do not expect to pay significant rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases. We do not own any real property.
 
We opened one restaurant in each year from 2019 through 2021, and we have opened two restaurants so far in 2022. We currently have 5 new locations under construction/development, and we expect to begin operations of the 5 new locations in 2023. Also, we are expecting to open an additional 6 new restaurants in 2023 by utilizing the net proceeds from the IPO.
 
With respect to the 5 new locations under construction/development, the Company has entered into construction agreements with various developers for certain tenant improvements to the store locations in Corona, Garden Grove, Menifee, Laguna Niguel and San Clemente.
 
We have finalized site selection for 6 of the upcoming 2023 restaurants for the following sites in Southern California: Cypress, Santa Ana, Ontario, Dana Point and Tustin; and one location in Washington: Seattle. We have executed commercial lease terms for Cypress, and we are in the process of negotiating a lease agreement for Santa Ana, Ontario, Tustin, Dana Point and Seattle. Site selection is ongoing for the other upcoming locations.
 
The Company anticipates approximately $350,000 in costs per a new location in development, and has spent approximately $490,000 for the 5 locations under construction/development as of December 31, 2022.
 
Assuming the Company is successful in opening the 11 locations in 2023 as set forth above, based on the anticipated development costs of the 1 location, the total anticipated costs of opening the11 locations in 2023 is approximately $3.4 million.
 
In 2019, we closed West Hollywood and Lynwood, California restaurants due to underperformance. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to open any specific number of restaurants in any year. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our long-term success is highly dependent on our ability to successfully identify and secure appropriate sites and timely develop and expand our operations in existing and new markets.”
 
Site Development and Expansion
 
Site Selection Process
 
We consider site selection to be instrumental to our success. As part of our strategic site selection process, we receive potential site locations from networks of local brokers, which are then reviewed by our Development Team. This examination consists of an analysis of the lease terms and conditions, a profitability evaluation, as well as multiple site visits during all times of the day, e.g., lunch, late afternoon, dinner, weekdays and weekends, to test for traffic. The Development Team holds regular meetings for site approval with other members of our senior management team in order to get a balanced perspective on a potential site.

Our current real estate strategy focuses on high-traffic retail centers in markets with a diverse population and above-average household income for the state. We believe we are attractive lessees for landlords given our ability to drive strong traffic comprised of above-average household income guests, and we imagine our bargaining power will become stronger as we accumulate more stores. In site selection, we also consider factors such as residential and commercial population density, restaurant visibility, traffic patterns, accessibility, availability of suitable parking, proximity to highways, universities, shopping areas and office parks, the degree of competition within the market area, and general availability of restaurant-level employees. We also invest in site analytics tools for demographic analysis and data collection for both existing and new market areas, which we believe allows us to further understand the market area and determine whether to open new restaurants in that location.
 
Our flexible physical footprint, which has allowed us to open restaurants in size ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 square feet, allows us to open in-line and end-cap restaurant formats at strip malls and shopping centers and penetrate markets in both suburban and urban areas. We believe we have the ability to open additional restaurants in our existing metropolitan areas. We also believe there is significant opportunity to employ the strategy in new markets with similar demographics across the U.S. and globally.
 
Expansion Strategy
 
We plan to pursue a multi-facet expansion strategy by opening new corporate restaurants in both new and existing markets, as well as utilizing the franchise market. We believe this expansion will be crucial to executing our growth strategy and building awareness of Yoshiharu as a leading Japanese casual dining brand. Expansion into new markets occurs in parallel with ongoing evaluation of existing markets, with the goal of maintaining a pipeline of top-tier development opportunities. As described under Site Selection Process, we use a systematic approach to identify and review existing and new markets.
 
Upon selecting a new market, we typically build one restaurant to prove concept viability in that market. We have developed a remote management system whereby our senior operations team is able to monitor restaurants in real-time from our headquarters using approximately 8 cameras installed in each restaurant. We utilize this remote management system to maintain operational quality while minimizing inefficiencies caused by a lack of economies of scale in new markets.
 
Due to our relatively small restaurant count, new restaurants have an outsized impact on our financial performance. In order to mitigate risk, we look to expand simultaneously in new and existing markets. We base our site selection on our most successful existing restaurants and frequently reevaluate our strategy, pacing and markets. We believe we are in the early stages of our growth story and that our restaurant model is designed to generate strong cash flow, attractive restaurant-level financial results and high returns on invested capital, which we believe provides us with a strong foundation for expansion.
 
Restaurant Design
 
Restaurant design is handled by our Development Team in conjunction with outsourced vendor relationships, e.g., architects and general contractors. Our restaurant size currently averages approximately 1,500 square feet. Seating in our restaurant is comprised of a combination of table seating and bar seats with an average seating capacity of 40-50 guests.
 
We are developing two main restaurant layouts. The standard restaurants will be built using our current layout and design which we believe evokes a modern and on-trend Japanese dining atmosphere. The second layout is the larger plan where we will utilize a full service restaurant and bar. We believe the new layout achieves this atmosphere. We believe our see-through kitchens reflecting the cooks preparing first hand meals, amplify the lively bustle provided by the great casual atmosphere, and serve to highlight the ambiance of getting great food in a modern Japanese style ambiance.

Construction
 
Construction of a new restaurant takes approximately 12 to 24 weeks once construction permits (e.g., Health and City) are issued. Our Development Team oversees the build-out process from engaging architects and contractors to design and build out the restaurant. The capital resources required to develop each new restaurant are significant. On average, we estimate our restaurant build-outs to cost approximately $350,000 - $550,000 per standard location, net of tenant allowances and pre-opening costs and assuming that we do not purchase the underlying real estate, but this figure could be significantly higher depending on the market, restaurant size, and condition of the premises upon delivery by landlord. On average, we estimate that our restaurants require a cash build-out cost of approximately $350,000-$550,000 per restaurant, net of landlord tenant improvement allowances and pre-opening costs and assuming that we do not purchase the underlying real estate. Actual costs may vary significantly depending upon a variety of factors, including the site and size of the restaurant and conditions in the local real estate and labor markets.
Restaurant Management and Operations
 
Restaurant Management and Employees
 
Our restaurants typically employ one restaurant manager, one or two supervisors, and approximately 8 to 12 additional team members. Managers, supervisors and management trainees are cross-trained throughout the restaurant in order to create competency across critical restaurant functions, both in the dining area and in the kitchen.
 
In addition, our senior operations team monitors restaurants in real-time from our headquarters using our remote management system of approximately 8 cameras installed in each restaurant. These team members are responsible for different components of the restaurant: cleanliness, service, and food quality.
 
Training and Employee Programs
 
We devote significant resources to identifying, selecting, and training restaurant-level employees. Our training covers leadership, team building, food safety certification, alcohol safety programs, sexual harassment training, and other topics. Management trainees undergo training for approximately 8 to 16 weeks in order to develop a deep understanding of our operations. In addition, we are developing extensive training manuals that cover all aspects of restaurant-level operations.
 
Our traveling “opening team” provides training to team members in advance of opening a new restaurant. We believe the opening team facilitates a smooth opening process and efficient restaurant operations from the first day a restaurant opens to the public. The opening team is typically on-site at new restaurants from two weeks before opening to four weeks after opening.
 
Food Preparation, Quality and Safety
 
We are committed to consistently providing our guests high quality, freshly prepared food. For other items we believe hand preparation achieves the best quality. Hand preparation of menu items includes, but is not limited to, frying tempura, slicing meat and fish and making pork bone broth. We believe guests can taste the difference in freshly prepared food and that adhering to these standards is a competitive advantage for our brand.
 
Food safety is essential to our success and we have established procedures to help ensure that our guests enjoy safe, quality food. We require each employee to complete food handler safety certification upon hiring. We have taken various additional steps to mitigate food quality and safety risks, including undergoing internal safety audits. We also consider food safety and quality assurance when selecting our distributors and suppliers.
 
Menu
 
We offer a diverse menu, including our signature ramen dishes, as well as sushi rolls, bento boxes, and other Japanese cuisine. The menu appeals to a wide range of customers, and we continue to improve upon the quality, taste and presentation. Additionally, we are able to serve the menu in a delivery and pickup format, as our food is designed to be enjoyed on premise or at customers’ homes or offices. We have entered the catering business through relationships with businesses who place large format orders (i.e., Bento boxes for corporate meetings or office lunches), for delivery or pick-up. We expect that our catering business, which has a higher-than-average order value, to grow due to the early success we have experienced in the corporate channel.

New Menu Introductions
 
We focus advertising efforts on new menu offerings to broaden our appeal to guests and drive traffic. Our menu changes twice per year to introduce new items and remove underperforming items. We promote these new menu additions through various social media platforms, our website and in-restaurant signage.
Marketing and Advertising
 
We use a variety of marketing and advertising channels to build brand awareness, attract new guests, increase dining frequency, support new restaurant openings, and promote Yoshiharu as an authentic Japanese restaurant with high-quality cuisine and a distinctive dining experience. Our primary advertising channels include digital, social, and print.
Social Media
 
We maintain a presence on several social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram, allowing us to regularly communicate with guests, alert guests of new offerings, and conduct promotions. Our dining experience is built to provide our guests social media shareable moments, which we believe extends our advertising reach.
Suppliers
 
We carefully select suppliers based on product quality and authenticity and their understanding of our brand, and we seek to develop long-term relationships with them. All supply arrangements are negotiated and managed at the Yoshiharu corporate-level.
 
Food. Our Vice President of Operations identifies and procures high-quality ingredients at competitive prices. Each store separately makes an order to the specific vendor, and the invoices are submitted and paid by Yoshiharu at the corporate-level. We source mainly through the following Japanese-related distributors: JFC, a subsidiary of Kikkoman Corporation, Wismettac, a subsidiary of Nishimoto Co., Ltd., and Mutual Trading Co., Inc., a California corporation.
 
Paper. Our Vice President of Operations negotiates long term supply agreements for our logo-branded paper including takeout bags and bowls, chopsticks, as well as uniforms. We make a portion of our purchases annually in bulk at fixed prices, and deliver them to our warehouse in Anaheim, California. Each restaurant Manager receives the necessary paper supplies from our warehouse.
 
Management Information Systems
 
We utilize systems provided by Toast, Inc. for point of sale, contactless ordering, handheld ordering, online ordering and delivery, as well as marketing and payroll management. We believe that Toast’s systems provide us and our customers with streamlined operations and allows us to efficiently turn tables and improve the sales conversion cycle, while reducing third-party commissions for online orders.
Restaurant Industry Overview
 
According to the National Restaurant Association (the “NRA”), U.S. restaurant industry sales in calendar year 2021 were $799.0 billion and are expected to grow at a growth rate of 12.4% to $898 billion in calendar year 2022 and reach $997 billion in calendar year 2023.
 
The restaurant industry is divided into several primary segments, including limited-service and full-service restaurants, which are generally categorized by price, quality of food, service, and location. Yoshiharu sits at the intersection of these two segments offering the experience and food quality of a full-service restaurant and the speed of service of a limited-service restaurant. We primarily compete with other full-service restaurants, which, according to the NRA, had approximately $285 billion of sales in calendar year 2019, prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase of 3.8% over 2019. The limited-service segment generated $309 billion in calendar year 2019, or 3.2% over the prior year. COVID-19 had a material impact on consumer spending at restaurants in 2020, resulting in a decrease compared to the prior year.

-


However, for 2021, full-service restaurant sales increased to $261 billion in calendar year 2021, an increase of 31.2% over 2020, while limited-service restaurants generated $329 billion in sales, or 10.8% over the prior year due to rising vaccination numbers and consumers’ pent-up demand. Full-service restaurant sales are expected to increase to $289 billion in calendar year 2022, an increase of 10.9% from 2021 and the limited-service segment is forecast to reach $355 billion in 2022, resulting in a 7.9% increase from 2021.
 
We believe that increased multiculturalism in the United States, driven in part by growth in the Asian demographic, contributes to a favorable macro environment for Yoshiharu’s future growth. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Asian population is projected to be one of the fastest growing demographics in the United States, increasing in size from 20 million people in calendar year 2020 to 24.4 million people by calendar year 2030. During this time, the Asian population’s share of the nation’s total population is projected to increase by 15%, from approximately 6% to 6.9%.
 
Additionally, we believe that Yoshiharu is well-positioned to grow our share of the restaurant market as consumers seek quality, value, healthier options, and authentic global and regional cuisine in their dining choices. According to the National Restaurant Association 2019 State of the Industry report, more than 60% of customers cite the availability of healthy menu options as a key factor in restaurant choice when eating out. In addition, as referenced in the same report, ethnic spices, ethnic condiments, and Asian soups were among the projected top 25 food trends for limited-service restaurants in calendar year 2019  .
 
We cannot provide assurance that we will benefit from these long-term demographic trends, although we believe the projected growth in the Asian population and the Asian influence on dining trends will result in an increase in demand for Japanese and Asian foods.
 
Competition
 
We face significant competition from a variety of locally owned restaurants regional, and national chain restaurants offering both Asian and non-Asian cuisine, as well as takeaway options from grocery stores. Direct competition for Yoshiharu comes primarily from Asian restaurants including other ramen noodles restaurants. Jinya Ramen Bar operates approximately 40 locations in the United States and also franchises their restaurants. We believe that we compete primarily based on product quality, dining experience, ambience, location, convenience, value perception, and price. Our competition continues to intensify as competitors increase the breadth and depth of their product offerings and open new restaurants.
Seasonality
 
Due to Yoshiharu’s menu breadth and diversification of offerings, we do not experience significant seasonality.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022  , we had approximately 130 employees, of whom 24 were exempt employees and the remainder were non-exempt employees. None of our employees are unionized or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our current employee relations to be good.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to extensive and varied federal, state and local government regulation, including regulations relating, among others, to public and occupational health and safety, nutritional menu labeling, healthcare, the environment, sanitation and fire prevention. We operate each of our restaurants in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable codes and regulations. However, an inability to obtain or retain health department or other licenses would adversely affect our operations. Although we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, any significant difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining required licenses, permits or approvals, any such problem could delay or prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, a particular restaurant or group of restaurants. Additionally, difficulties, delays or failure to retain or renew licenses, permits or approvals, or increased compliance costs due to changed regulations, could adversely affect operations at existing restaurants.

In addition, in order to develop and construct restaurants, we must comply with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. Federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on our operations to date, but more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or even prevent construction and increase development costs for new restaurants. We are also required to comply with the accessibility standards mandated by the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, which generally prohibits discrimination in accommodation or employment based on disability. We may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example, by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. While these expenses could be material, our current expectation is that any such actions will not require us to expend substantial funds.
 
Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities for a license that must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of daily operations of our restaurants, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, trade practices, wholesale purchasing, other relationships with alcohol manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. We are also subject in certain states to “dram shop” statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance.
 
Further, we are subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various other federal and state laws governing similar matters including minimum wages, overtime, workplace safety and other working conditions. Significant numbers of our food service and preparation personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage, and further increases in the minimum wage or other changes in these laws could increase our labor costs. Our ability to respond to minimum wage increases by increasing menu prices will depend on the responses of our competitors and guests. Our distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards, which could result in higher costs of goods and services supplied by us. We may also be subject to lawsuits from our employees, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or others alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters.
 
There has been increased regulation of certain food establishments in the United States, such as the requirements to maintain a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (“HACCP”) system. HACCP refers to a management system in which food safety is addressed through the analysis and control of potential hazards from production, procurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product. Many states have required restaurants to develop and implement HACCP systems and the U.S. government continues to expand the sectors of the food industry that must adopt and implement HACCP programs. We cannot assure you that we will not have to expend additional time and resources to comply with new food safety requirements either required by current or future federal food safety regulation or legislation. Additionally, our suppliers may initiate or otherwise be subject to food recalls that may impact the availability of certain products, result in adverse publicity or require us to take actions that could be costly for us or otherwise harm our business.
 
A number of states, counties and cities have enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to disclose to consumers certain nutritional information, or have enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. Many of these requirements are inconsistent or interpreted differently from one jurisdiction to another. These requirements may be different or inconsistent with requirements that we are subject to under the ACA, which establishes a uniform, federal requirement for certain restaurants to post nutritional information on their menus. Specifically, the ACA requires chain restaurants with 20 or more locations in the United States operating under the same name and offering substantially the same menus to publish the total number of calories of standard menu items on menus and menu boards, along with a statement that puts this calorie information in the context of a total daily calorie intake. The ACA also requires covered restaurants to provide to consumers, upon request, a written summary of detailed nutritional information for each standard menu item, and to provide a statement on menus and menu boards about the availability of this information upon request. While our ability to adapt to consumer preferences is a strength of our concepts, the effect of such labeling requirements on consumer choices, if any, is unclear at this time.

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning waste disposal, pollution, protection of the environment, and the presence, discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous or toxic substances (“environmental laws”). These environmental laws can provide for significant fines and penalties for non-compliance and liabilities for remediation, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances. We are not aware of any environmental laws that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position, or result in material capital expenditures relating to our restaurants. However, we cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future, how existing or future environmental laws will be administered, interpreted or enforced, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with, or to satisfy claims relating to, environmental laws. It is possible that we will become subject to environmental liabilities at our properties, and any such liabilities could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments, gift cards and consumer credit, protection and fraud, and any failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could harm our reputation or lead to litigation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Furthermore, we are subject to import laws and tariffs which could impact our ability to source and secure food products, other supplies and equipment necessary to operate our restaurants.

Intellectual Property and Trademarks
 
Yoshiharu Holdings Co., our wholly owned subsidiary, owns a number of patents, trademarks and service marks registered or pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”). The Company has registered the following marks with the PTO: YOSHIHARU RAMEN (Trademark Reg. No. 5030823) and Design Mark YOSHIHARU RAMEN (Trademark Reg. No. 5045588). In addition, we have registered the Internet domain name www.yoshiharuramen.com. The information on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of this Report.
 
We believe that the trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property rights that we license from Yoshiharu Holdings Co. have significant value and are important to the marketing and reputation of our brand. It is our policy to pursue registration of our intellectual property whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement thereof. However, we cannot predict whether steps taken to protect such rights will be adequate or whether Yoshiharu Holdings Co. will take steps to enforce such rights with regard to any intellectual property that we license from them. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may become involved in lawsuits involving Yoshiharu Holdings Co. as the owner of intellectual property, or us as a licensee of intellectual property from Yoshiharu Holdings Co., to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful.” We are aware of third-party restaurants with names similar to our restaurant name in certain limited geographical areas such as in California. However, we believe such uses will not adversely affect us.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
We are currently not involved in litigation that we believe will have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self- regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our company’s or our company’s subsidiaries’ officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision is expected to have a material adverse effect.
