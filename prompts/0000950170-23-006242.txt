Item 1. Business
In this Annual Report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Orthofix,” and “the Company” refer to the combined operations of Orthofix Medical Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, unless the context requires otherwise.
Company Overview
Following our recent merger with SeaSpine Holdings Corporation ("SeaSpine"), the newly merged Orthofix-SeaSpine organization is a leading global spine and orthopedics company with a comprehensive portfolio of biologics, innovative spinal hardware, bone growth therapies, specialized orthopedic solutions and a leading surgical navigation system. Our products are distributed in approximately 68 countries worldwide through a combination of direct and indirect sales representatives and stocking distributors.
 We are headquartered in Lewisville, Texas and have primary offices in Carlsbad, CA, with a focus on spine and biologics product innovation and surgeon education, and Verona, Italy, with an emphasis on product innovation, production, and medical education for orthopedics. Our combined global R&D, commercial and manufacturing footprint also includes facilities and offices in Irvine, CA, Toronto, Canada, Sunnyvale, CA, Wayne, PA, Olive Branch, MS, Maidenhead, UK, Munich, Germany, Paris, France and Sao Paulo, Brazil.
The Company originally was formed in 1987 in Curaçao as “Orthofix International N.V.” In 2018, we completed a change in our jurisdiction of organization from Curaçao to the State of Delaware (the “Domestication”) and changed our name to “Orthofix Medical Inc.” As a result, we are a corporation existing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
 Our merger with SeaSpine was completed on January 5, 2023, with SeaSpine continuing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orthofix following the transaction. Orthofix, as the corporate parent entity in the combined company structure, continues to trade on NASDAQ under the symbol “OFIX.” The parent company will be renamed at a later date, and until then, will continue to be known as Orthofix Medical Inc. The disclosures in this Item 1 of this Annual Report under the heading “Business” speak to the combined company subsequent to the merger unless otherwise noted. However, the financial results described herein relate, except as otherwise expressly noted herein, to Orthofix on a standalone basis without to giving effect to merger and, accordingly, do not include the results of SeaSpine. Future filings, beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023, will reflect the results of the combined Orthofix-SeaSpine organization.

Business Segments
Historically, Orthofix has managed the business by two reporting segments, Global Spine and Global Orthopedics, which account for 77% and 23%, respectively, of Orthofix's total net sales in 2022. The chart below presents Orthofix's net sales, which includes product sales and marketing service fees, by reporting segment for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. As noted above, these amounts do not include the net sales of SeaSpine.




SeaSpine has historically managed its business as one operating segment, but with revenue reported in two product categories: (i) Biologics (formerly recognized as Orthobiologics) and (ii) Spinal Implants and Enabling Technologies. For purposes of this Annual Report, SeaSpine's historical business description is included within this discussion of Business Segments as a separate segment. Following the merger with SeaSpine, which was completed on January 5, 2023, we expect to reassess our reporting segments in the first quarter of 2023 based on how the operations of the newly combined company will be managed.
 Financial information regarding our reportable business segments and certain geographic information is included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Global Spine Principal Products
 The Global Spine reporting segment is largely represented by three principal product categories, i) Bone Growth Therapies, ii) Spinal Implants, and iii) Biologics. Each of these product categories are further described below:
Bone Growth Therapies
 Within the Bone Growth Therapies product category, we manufacture, distribute, and provide support services for market-leading bone growth stimulation devices that enhance bone fusion. These class III medical devices are indicated as an adjunctive, noninvasive treatment to improve fusion success rates in the cervical and lumbar spine as well as a therapeutic treatment for non-spinal, appendicular fractures that have not healed ("nonunions"). Several devices in our portfolio utilize our patented pulsed electromagnetic field (“PEMF”) technology, the safety and efficacy of which is supported by basic mechanism of action data in the scientific literature, as well as published data from level one randomized controlled clinical trials. A new addition to our stimulation portfolio utilizes our low intensity pulsed ultrasound ("LIPUS"), a technology also supported by strong basic science and published clinical literature. Orthofix is the only manufacturer which offers both PEMF and LIPUS technologies. We sell these products almost exclusively in the U.S. using distributors and direct sales representatives to provide our devices to healthcare providers and their patients.
Spinal Implants
 Within the Spinal Implants product category, we design, develop, and market a portfolio of motion preservation and fixation implant products used in surgical procedures of the spine. We distribute these products globally through a network of distributors and sales representatives to sell spine products to facilities that conduct spine care, including hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and out-patient hospitals.
Biologics
 Within the Biologics product category, we offer a portfolio of products and tissue forms that allow physicians to successfully treat a variety of spinal and orthopedic conditions. We market tissue forms provided by MTF Biologics (“MTF”) to spine care facilities and surgeons, primarily in the U.S., through a network of independent distributors and sales representatives. Our partnership with MTF allows us to exclusively market the Virtuos Lyograph, Trinity ELITE, FiberFuse Advanced, FiberFuse Strip, and certain other tissue forms for musculoskeletal defects to enhance bony fusion. In addition, we market regenerative non-tissue biologic solutions derived from synthetic materials. Opus BA, and Opus MG Set represent our current synthetic, biologic offering.

Bone Growth Therapies — Spinal Therapy
 Our bone growth therapy devices used in spinal applications are designed to enhance bone growth and improve the success rate of certain spinal fusion procedures by stimulating the body’s own natural healing mechanism post-surgically. These non-invasive portable devices are intended to be used as part of a home treatment program prescribed by a physician.
We offer two spinal fusion therapy devices: the SpinalStim and CervicalStim devices. Our stimulation products use a PEMF technology designed to enhance the growth of bone tissue following surgery and are placed externally over the site to be healed. Research data shows that our PEMF signal induces mineralization and results in a process that stimulates new regeneration at the spinal fusion site. Some spine fusion patients are at greater risk of not achieving a solid fusion of new bone around the fusion site. These patients typically have one or more risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, or diabetes, or their surgery involves the revision of a failed fusion or the fusion of multiple levels of vertebrae in one procedure. For these patients, post-surgical bone growth therapy has been shown to significantly increase the probability of fusion success.
 The SpinalStim device is a non-invasive spinal fusion stimulator system designed for the treatment of the lumbar region of the spine. The device uses proprietary technology and a wavelength to generate a PEMF signal. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has approved the SpinalStim system as a spinal fusion adjunct to increase the probability of fusion success and as a non-operative treatment for salvage of failed spinal fusion at least nine months post-operatively.
Our CervicalStim product remains the only FDA-approved bone growth stimulator on the market indicated for use as an adjunct to cervical spine fusion surgery. It is indicated for patients at high-risk for non-fusion.
The SpinalStim and CervicalStim systems are accompanied by an application for mobile devices called STIM onTrack. The mobile app includes a first-to-market feature that enables physicians to remotely view patient adherence to prescribed treatment protocols and patient reported outcome measures. Designed for use with smartphones and other mobile devices, the STIM onTrack tool helps patients follow their prescription with daily treatment reminders and a device usage calendar. The app is free and available through the Android and Apple App Stores.
Bone Growth Therapies — Orthopedic Therapy
 Our PhysioStim bone healing therapy products use PEMF technology similar to that used in our spine stimulators. The primary difference is that the PhysioStim devices are designed for use on the appendicular skeleton.
A bone’s regenerative power results in most fractures healing naturally within a few months. However, in the presence of certain risk factors, some fractures do not heal or heal slowly, resulting in “nonunions.” Traditionally, orthopedists have treated such nonunion conditions surgically, often by means of a bone graft with fracture fixation devices, such as bone plates, screws, or

intramedullary rods. These are examples of “invasive” treatments. Our patented PhysioStim bone healing therapy products are designed to use a low level of PEMF signals to noninvasively activate the body’s natural healing process. The devices are anatomically designed, allowing ease of placement, patient mobility, and the ability to cover a large treatment area.
Similar to our SpinalStim and CervicalStim systems, the PhysioStim device is also accompanied by the STIM onTrack mobile app, enabling physicians treating patients with nonunion fractures to remotely view and assess patient adherence to prescribed treatment protocols and patient reported outcome measures.
 The AccelStim device provides a safe and effective nonsurgical treatment to improve nonunion fracture healing and accelerate the healing of indicated fresh fractures. The device stimulates the bone’s natural healing process through LIPUS waves to the fracture site.
 Spinal Implants — Motion Preservation Solutions
 Our M6-C cervical and M6-L lumbar artificial discs are used to treat patients suffering from degenerative disc disease of the spine. The M6 discs are the only FDA-approved artificial discs that mimic the anatomic structure of a natural disc by incorporating an artificial viscoelastic nucleus and fiber annulus into their design. Like a natural disc, this unique construct allows for shock absorption at the implanted level, as well as provides a controlled range of motion when the spine transitions in its combined complex movements. Both discs have European Commission CE mark approval and in February 2019, we received FDA approval of the M6-C artificial cervical disc to treat patients with a single-level cervical disc degeneration. We released the M6-C artificial cervical disc in the U.S. in 2019 through a controlled market launch accompanied by an extensive training and education curriculum for surgeons. The M6-C disc has become our leading spinal implant device and has contributed significantly to our growth in recent years. In addition, we have initiated a U.S. 2-level investigational device exemption (“IDE”) study for the M6-C artificial cervical disc, which is currently enrolling.
 Spinal Implants — Spinal Fixation Solutions
We provide a wide array of implants designed for use primarily in cervical, thoracic, and lumbar fusion surgeries. These implants are made of either metal or a thermoplastic compound called PEEK. The majority of the implants that we offer are made of titanium metal. The Firebird Spinal Fixation System, the Phoenix Minimally Invasive Spinal Fixation System, and the Centurion POCT Systems are sets of rods, cross connectors, and screws that are implanted during posterior fusion procedures. The Firebird Modular and pre-assembled Spinal Fixation Systems are designed to be used in either open or minimally-invasive posterior lumbar fusion procedures. To complement our plates, rods, and screw fixation options, we offer an entire portfolio of cervical and thoracolumbar Titanium and PEEK interbody devices within our Pillar and Forza product lines. We have recently introduced two, new 3D printed interbody solutions, Construx Mini Ti for cervical and Forza Ti for posterior lumbar implantation. This interbody portfolio includes two stand-alone devices, Lonestar and Pillar SA, as well as the Construx Mini PTC system, a novel titanium composite spacer, which offers a superior alternative to other plasma spray coated options currently available on the market. We also offer specialty plates and screws that are used in less common procedures.
 Biologics — Regenerative Solutions
The premium biologics tissues we market include the Virtuos Lyograft and Trinity ELITE tissue forms, which are cortico-cancellous allografts that retain the inherent growth factors and viable cells found in bone. They are used during surgery in the treatment of musculoskeletal defects for bone reconstruction and repair. These allografts are intended to offer a viable alternative to an autograft procedure, as harvesting autograft has been shown to add risk of an additional surgical procedure and related patient discomfort in conjunction with a repair surgery. Virtuos Lyograft is particularly unique in that it is a first-of-its-kind, shelf-stable and complete autograft substitute for spine and orthopedic procedures provided in a room-temperature, ready-to-use, moldable form.
 The FiberFuse Advanced tissue is a tissue form with handling characteristics analogous to the Trinity ELITE product without compromising bone content. It provides an advanced demineralized bone offering that leverages fiber technology with the advantages of ingrowth that cancellous bone provides and expands the offering to address a broader scope of surgical applications. FiberFuse Strip is a preformed allograft form of FiberFuse Advanced that consists of mineralized cancellous bone and demineralized cortical fibers, providing an ideal matrix for bone healing. Legacy DBM is a ready-to-use, flowable, demineralized bone putty and provides a cost-effective option without compromising clinical experience.
 We receive marketing fees through our collaboration with MTF for the Virtuos, Trinity ELITE, FiberFuse Advanced, FiberFuse Strip, Legacy DBM and certain other tissues. MTF processes the tissues, maintains inventory, and invoices hospitals, surgery centers, and other points of care for service fees, which are submitted by customers via purchase orders. We have exclusive worldwide rights to market the Virtuos and Trinity ELITE and exclusive rights to market the FiberFuse Advanced and FiberFuse Strip tissues in the U.S.

Regarding synthetic, biologic solutions, we offer Opus BA and Opus Mg Set. Opus BA is a synthetic bioactive solution that is easily hydrated and flexible. A carefully selected trifecta of components creates an ideal environment for bone growth building on the earlier generations of synthetic bone grafts. Opus Mg Set is an injectable, moldable, and biocompatible bone void filler that will harden in-situ at the defect site.
 To date, our Biologics products are offered primarily in the U.S. market due in part to restrictions on providing U.S. human donor tissue in other countries.
 Global Spine Future Product Applications
 We remain very active with multiple internal developments to support future, new technology commercialization efforts. These new technologies will apply to both the cervical and thoracolumbar spinal anatomy. In addition, we remain active in evaluating external licensing and acquisition opportunities to add implant, biologics, and other emerging technologies to our spine portfolio. We expect that the contribution of new, internally developed technologies and undefined external acquisitions will be the primary driver of future growth.
Regarding our Bone Growth Therapy business, we have participated in research at the Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Chinese University of Hong Kong, and University of California San Francisco, where scientists conducted animal and cellular studies to identify the mechanisms of action of our PEMF signals on bone, cartilage, meniscus, nerve, and efficacy of healing. From these efforts, some studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Among other insights, the studies illustrate positive effects of PEMF on callus formation and bone strength, meniscus and nerve injury repair, as well as proliferation and differentiation of cells involved in tissue regeneration and healing. Furthermore, we believe that the previous research work with Cleveland Clinic, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the University of Pennsylvania, allowing for characterization and demonstration of the Orthofix new PEMF waveform, is paving the way for signal optimization for a variety of new applications and indications. This collection of pre-clinical data, along with additional clinical data, could represent new clinical indication opportunities for our regenerative stimulation solutions. In addition, we also have initiated a U.S. 2-Level IDE study for the M6-C artificial cervical disc.

OrthoNext Digital Platform | A digital platform software developed specifically for use with the JuniOrtho Plating System and Fitbone Intramedullary Limb Lengthening System, which enables the surgeon to accurately plan the deformity correction and osteotomy position as well as visualize the implant in relation to the anatomy 

 We provide internal and external fixation solutions for extremity repair and deformity correction, both for adults and children. Our fracture repair products consist of fixation devices designed to stabilize a broken bone until it can heal. With these devices, we can treat simple and complex fracture patterns, along with achieving deformity corrections.
External Fixation
External fixation devices are used to stabilize fractures and offer an ideal treatment for complex fractures, fractures near the joints, and in patients with known risk factors or co-morbidities. The treatment is minimally invasive and allows external manipulation of the bone to obtain and maintain final bone alignment (reduction). The bone is fixed in this way until healing occurs. External fixation allows small degrees of micromotion (dynamization), which promotes blood flow at the fracture site, and accelerates the bone healing process. External fixation devices may also be used temporarily in complex trauma cases to stabilize the fracture prior to treating it definitively. In these situations, the device offers rapid fracture stabilization, which is important in life-saving as well as limb salvage procedures.
We offer most of our products in sterile packaging, which fulfills the need of a streamlined and ready-to-use set of products, particularly in trauma applications where timing is crucial.
 Examples of our external fixation devices include the TrueLok, TL-HEX, TrueLok Evo, the Galaxy and Galaxy Gemini Fixation Systems, and the LRS Advanced Limb Reconstruction System.


Internal Fixation
 Internal fixation devices consist of either long rods, commonly referred to as nails, or plates that are attached to the bone with the use of screws. Nails and plates come in various sizes, depending on the bone that requires treatment. A nail is inserted into the medullary canal of a fractured long bone of the human arm or leg (e.g., humerus, femur, or tibia). Alternatively, a plate is attached by screws to an area such as a broken wrist, hip, or foot. Examples of our internal fixation devices include Chimaera, AHN, and the G-BEAM Fusion Beaming System.
Acquired in March 2020, the FITBONE Intramedullary Limb Lengthening System provides an internal option for limb lengthening of the femur and tibia and provides Orthofix with the most complete limb reconstruction portfolio on the market. We are continuing to invest in the FITBONE technology platform in order to offer surgeons more solutions for deformity correction.
 In addition to treating bone fractures, we also design, manufacture, and distribute devices intended to treat congenital bone conditions, such as angular deformities (e.g., bowed legs in children), degenerative diseases, and conditions resulting from a previous trauma. An example of a product offered in this area is the eight-Plate Plus Guided Growth System.

 •Continue to pursue strategic alliances and acquisition opportunities to enhance our product offerings
 SeaSpine Principal Products
 SeaSpine is largely represented by two principal product categories, i) Biologics and ii) Spinal Implants and Enabling Technologies. Each of these product categories are further described below:
Biologics
 Our Biologics products are used in orthopedic and dental procedures and consist of a broad range of bone graft substitutes intended to address the key elements of bone regeneration. Bone graft substitutes are composed of natural biologic proteins and synthetic materials. They are designed to reduce the amount of autologous bone grafts needed for spinal fusion procedures. Bone graft substitutes, depending on their design, can be used entirely in place of the patient’s own bone tissue, called an autograft, or by extending the volume of bone graft material from the patient by combining it with the bone graft substitute. Our Biologics portfolio includes fibers-based and particulate DBM, collagen ceramic matrices, demineralized cancellous allograft bone and synthetic bone void fillers. We offer our Biologics products in the form of fibers, putties, pastes, strips and DBM in a resorbable mesh for a range of surgical applications.
Spinal Implants and Enabling Technologies
 Our Spinal Implants and Enabling Technology portfolio consists of an extensive line of products for spinal decompression, alignment, stabilization and image-guided surgical solutions as well as a surgical navigation system designed for broad spectrum use throughout the entire spinal column. Such products are typically used to facilitate fusion in degenerative, minimally invasive, and complex spinal deformity procedures throughout the lumbar, thoracic and cervical regions of the spine. Our products are increasingly focused on restoring adequate spinal balance and profile in the sagittal (front to back) plane, which we believe is widely recognized as an important factor to improve the quality of life in patients undergoing surgery for spinal degeneration or deformity.

Enabling Technologies
 Our machine vision FLASH navigation platform is used in a variety of posterior spinal procedures, including degenerative, deformity, tumor, trauma, and revision surgery. The platform can be utilized in MIS/Percutaneous, Mini-Open, or Open techniques. The technology also offers a comprehensive cranial platform for use in cranial neurosurgery.
Our innovative FLASH Navigation System with 7D Technology delivers a comprehensive navigation platform that utilizes visible light, machine-vision cameras, and intelligent software algorithms to create a 3D image within seconds for surgical navigation. The novel technology allows for a fast image reconstruction for surgical navigation with no disruption to surgeon workflow and eliminates radiation exposure during the procedure to the patient, surgeon, and operating room staff.
Our Spine Module is our leading product in the FLASH Navigation Portfolio with over 104 installations globally. In 2022, we further enhanced the Spine Module by adding preplanning features, as well as fully integrating the Mariner Posterior Fixation System, Mariner MIS Posterior Fixation System, and the Northstar OCT Posterior Cervical Fixation System into the platform with both hardware and software enhancements. We also released our commercial FLASH Percutaneous Spine Module in 2022 for the navigation of minimally invasive spinal procedures. This application, accompanied by new instrumentation, addresses an important part of the spine navigation market to round out the FLASH Navigation Platform and is a valuable enhancement for both hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers. Further enhancements and new features to the Spine Module and Percutaneous Module are in development and are expected to launch in 2023.
 In addition to these new products focused on spine, the FLASH Navigation Portfolio also consists of our Cranial Module for use in cranial surgeries. The technology uses a completely contactless workflow, acquiring hundreds of thousands of virtual fiducials using the patient’s own anatomy, and results in nearly instantaneous cranial registrations to the skin or skull in almost any surgical position. New developments are also underway and expected to launch in 2023 which leverage the 7D Technology to further expand cranial applications and enter the neurocritical care market with the launch of FLASH EVD ("Extra Ventricular Drainage"), a mobile bed-side navigational system designed for fast and reliable EVD placement.
SeaSpine Future Product Applications and Development
 We believe that our future success and ability to continue to drive revenue growth depends on our ability to sustain a similar cadence of launching new and next-generation products as we have demonstrated over the last few years. We continue to aggressively develop differentiated new products that we believe will allow the entrance into new markets and be even more competitive in markets in which we are underrepresented.
We expect to launch the next iteration of the FLASH Percutaneous Module and FLASH Spine Module with additional enhancements to our preplanning software as well as developing the framework for navigating interbody procedures. We also plan to launch FLASH EVD, a small mobile bed-side navigational system designed for fast and reliable EVD placement that will expand our total addressable market with this first entry into the neurocritical care market.
Product Development
 Our primary research and development facilities are located in Lewisville, Texas, Carlsbad, California, Toronto, Canada, and Verona, Italy.
We have a research and development organization dedicated to advancing our portfolio of spinal implants, biologics, orthopedic implants and external fixation devices, and machine vision image guidance innovations through product development and clinical affairs programs. Our product development efforts employ an integrated team approach that involves collaboration between surgeons, our engineers, our machinists, as well as our regulatory personnel. We also work with leading hospital research institutions and certain non-profit organization, such as MTF Biologics, surgeons, and other consultants, on the long-term scientific planning and evolution of our products and therapies. Several of the products that we market have been developed through these collaborations. In addition, we periodically receive suggestions for new products and product enhancements from the scientific and medical community, some of which result in us entering into assignment or license agreements with physicians and third parties.
 For our spine and orthopedics products, our product development teams, in consultation with design surgeons, formulate a design for the product and then our machinists build prototypes for testing our prototyping development and testing operation at our facilities. We use a broad scope of technologies designed to allow us to meet the complex engineering requirements of customers. As part of the development process, surgeons test the implantation of the products in our in-house cadaveric laboratories, which helps us design new products intended to meet the needs of both the surgeon and the patient. Our team refines or redesigns the prototype as necessary based on the results of the product testing, allowing us to perform rapid iterations of the design-prototype-test development cycle. Our clinical and regulatory personnel work in parallel with our product engineering personnel to facilitate

regulatory clearances of our products. We believe that these product development efforts allow us to provide solutions that respond to the needs of our surgeon customers and their patients.
Similar to the spine and orthopedics product development process, our software engineers, product managers and design surgeons are working towards the full integration of our spinal implants and biologics product lines with our machine vision FLASH navigation system. This includes the design of specific software modules, features and tracked instruments designed to meet the needs of a wide range of procedures including, degenerative, complex, revision, and deformity spine procedures. In addition, we are also exploring opportunities to integrate the 7D Technology into a variety of adult and pediatric orthopedic applications.
For biologics, we plan to develop line extensions for our innovative biologics technologies that will continue to improve bone forming potential while addressing specific procedural requirements both in the spine field and in general orthopedic applications. We are investigating new product formulations in the traditional DBM and Ceramic Matrix product categories. Our Biologics research and development team has experience in biomaterial sciences and bringing next generation technologies to market.
In 2022, 2021, and 2020, we incurred research and development expenses of $49.1 million, $49.6 million, and $39.1 million, respectively.
 Patents, Trade Secrets, Assignments and Licenses
We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, assignment and license agreements, and non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We possess numerous U.S. and foreign patents, have numerous pending patent applications, and have license rights under patents held by third parties. Our primary products are patented in the major markets in which they are sold. We do not believe that the expiration of any single patent is likely to significantly affect our intellectual property position. The medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. Patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain. Our success is dependent, in part, on us not infringing upon patents issued to others, including our competitors and potential competitors. While we make extensive efforts to ensure that our products do not infringe other parties’ patents and proprietary rights, our products and methods may be covered by patents held by our competitors. For a further discussion of these risks, please see Item 1A of this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors.”
 We rely on confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants, and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology.
We obtain assignments or licenses of varying durations for certain of our products from third parties. We typically acquire rights under such assignments or licenses in exchange for lump-sum payments or arrangements under which we pay a percentage of sales to the licensor. However, while assignments or licenses to us generally are irrevocable, no assurance can be given that these arrangements will continue to be made available to us on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. The terms of our license and assignment agreements vary in length from a specified number of years, to the life of product patents, or for the economic life of the product. These agreements generally provide for royalty payments and termination rights in the event of a material breach.
Compliance and Ethics Program
It is our fundamental policy to conduct business in accordance with the highest ethical and legal standards. We have a comprehensive compliance and ethics program, which is overseen by a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. The program is intended to promote lawful and ethical business practices throughout our domestic and international businesses. It is designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable federal, state, and local laws in accordance with the standards set forth in guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (“U.S. DOJ”) (“Evaluation of Corporate Compliance Programs” (updated June 2020)), the Office of Inspector General (HCCA-OIG “Measuring Compliance Program Effectiveness: A Resource Guide” (March 2017)), and the U.S. Sentencing Commission (“Effective Compliance and Ethics Programs” (November 2014)). Key elements of the program include:
Organizational oversight by senior-level personnel responsible for the compliance function within the Company 
 Written standards and procedures, including a Corporate Code of Conduct 
 Methods for communicating compliance concerns, including anonymous reporting mechanisms 
 Investigation and remediation measures to ensure a prompt response to reported matters and timely corrective action 
 Compliance education and training for employees and contracted business associates 


Auditing and monitoring controls to promote compliance with applicable laws and to assess program effectiveness 
 Disciplinary guidelines to enforce compliance and address violations 
 Due diligence reviews of high risk intermediaries and exclusion lists screening of employees and contracted business associates
 Risk assessments to identify areas of compliance risk. 
 Government Regulation
 Classification and Approval of Products by the FDA and other Regulatory Authorities
 Our research, development, and clinical programs, and our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and other countries. Most notably, all of our products sold in the U.S. are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and the Public Health Services Act as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The regulations that cover our products and facilities vary widely from country to country. The amount of time required to obtain approvals or clearances from regulatory authorities also differs from country to country.
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we commercially distribute in the U.S. is covered by premarket notification (“510(k)”) clearance, letter to file, approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”), or some other approval from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes, which generally determine the type of FDA approval required. Devices deemed to pose low risk are placed in class I, devices deemed to pose moderate risk are placed in class II, and devices deemed to pose the greatest risks, requiring more regulatory controls to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a device that previously received 510(k) clearance (as described below), are placed in class III. Our Spinal Implants and Global Orthopedics products are, for the most part, classified as class II devices and the instruments used with these products are generally classified as class I. Our 7D FLASH navigation system is classified as class II and certain accessories thereto are classified as class I. Our Bone Growth Therapies products and the M6-C artificial cervical disc are currently classified as class III, and have been approved for commercial distribution in the U.S. through the PMA process. However, an FDA panel recommended that bone growth stimulator devices be reclassified by the FDA from class III to class II devices with special controls. For additional discussion of this development, see Item 1A of this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors.”
The medical devices we develop, manufacture, distribute, and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining FDA clearance and other regulatory approvals to develop and market a medical device, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance such approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. While we believe we have obtained all necessary clearances and approvals for the manufacture and sale of our products and that they are in material compliance with applicable FDA and other material regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue such compliance.
In 2017, the European Union (“E.U.”) adopted the E.U. Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) (Council Regulations 2017/745), which imposes strict requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including new quality system and post-market surveillance requirements. The regulation, as amended in March 2023, provides a transition period for all currently-approved medical devices prior to May 2021 (under the European Medical Device Directive) to meet the additional requirements, and for certain devices, this transition period was extended until December 2027 for higher risk devices and until December 2028 for medium-and-lower risk devices. After this transition period, all medical devices marketed in the E.U. will require certification according to these new requirements. This regulation has required us to incur, and we expect to continue to incur, significant costs through the transition period and beyond to maintain compliance with the additional requirements. Failure to meet the requirements of the regulation could adversely impact our business in the E.U. and other countries that utilize or rely on E.U. requirements for medical device registrations.
 In the E.U., our products that contain human-derived tissue, including demineralized bone material, are not medical devices as defined in the MDR. They are also not medicinal products as defined in Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of the E.U. Today, the regulations in the E.U. governing products that contain human-derived tissue, if applicable, vary from one E.U. member state to the next. Because of the absence of a harmonized regulatory framework and the proposed regulation for advanced therapy medicinal products in the E.U., the approval process for human-derived cell or tissue-based medical products in the E.U. may be extensive, lengthy, expensive, and unpredictable.
 Certain countries, as well as the E.U., have issued regulations that govern products that contain materials derived from animal sources. Regulatory authorities are particularly concerned with materials infected with the agent that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("BSE"). These regulations affect our biomaterial products for the spine, which contain material derived from bovine

tissue. Although we take steps designed to provide that our products are safe and free of agents that can cause disease, products that contain materials derived from animals, including our products, may become subject to additional regulation, or even be banned in certain countries, because of concern over the potential for prion transmission. Significant new regulations, a ban of our products, or a movement away from bovine-derived products because of an outbreak of BSE could have a material and adverse effect on our business or our ability to expand our business. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Non-Compliance with Laws and Regulations - Certain of our products contain materials derived from animal sources and may become subject to additional regulation.”
 Within our Biologics product category, we market tissue for bone repair and reconstruction under the brand name Trinity ELITE, our allogeneic bone matrix comprised of cancellous bone containing viable cells and a demineralized cortical bone component. In addition, we provide demineralized cortical fiber technologies under the brand name FiberFuse, structural allografts for spinal fusion, and an amniotic membrane, which is a natural tissue barrier. These allografts are regulated under the FDA’s Human Cell, Tissues and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products ("HCT/P") regulatory paradigm and not as a medical device, biologic, or a drug. These tissues are regulated by the FDA as minimally-manipulated tissue and are covered by the FDA’s “Good Tissues Practices” regulations, which cover all stages of allograft processing. There can be no assurance our suppliers will continue to meet applicable regulatory requirements or that those requirements will not be changed in ways that could adversely affect our business. Further, there can be no assurance these products will continue to be made available to us or that applicable regulatory standards will be met or remain unchanged. Moreover, products derived from human tissue or bones are from time to time subject to recall for certain administrative or safety reasons and we may be affected by one or more such recalls.
 In addition to our allograft solutions (HCT/Ps), we market and distribute additional biologics products that are synthetic in nature and are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, specifically Opus BA and the Opus MG lines of synthetic grafts. We also provide ancillary technologies regulated by the FDA as medical devices that aid in the delivery of our bone grafting options clinically. These products are sourced from third party manufacturers, which we believe maintain an adequate inventory to avoid disruptions in product supply.
We also manufacture products derived from human tissue (demineralized bone tissue). Internally produced HCT/Ps may fall within the definition of a biological product, medical device, or drug regulated under the FDCA. These biologic, device or drug HCT/Ps must comply both with the requirements exclusively applicable to HCT/Ps and with requirements applicable to biologics, devices or drugs, including premarket clearance or approval from the FDA.
 Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as 361 HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, Good Tissue Practice when processing, storing, labeling, and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information, stringent record keeping, and adverse event reporting.
 The American Association of Tissue Banks ("AATB") has issued operating standards for tissue banking. Accreditation is voluntary, but compliance with these standards is a requirement to become an AATB-accredited tissue establishment. In addition, some states in the U.S. have their own tissue banking regulations. We are AATB-accredited and licensed or have permits for tissue banking in California, Florida, New York, Maryland, and other states that require specific licensing or registration.
 Procurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation is subject to the restrictions of the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), which prohibits the transfer of certain human organs, including skin and related tissue for valuable consideration, but permits the reasonable payment associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage of human tissue and skin. We reimburse tissue banks for their expenses associated with the recovery, storage and transportation of donated human tissue they provide to us for processing. We include in our pricing structure amounts paid to tissue banks to reimburse them for their expenses associated with the recovery and transportation of the tissue, in addition to certain costs associated with the processing, preservation, quality control and storage of the tissue, marketing and medical education expenses, and costs associated with development of tissue processing technologies. NOTA payment allowances may be interpreted to limit the amount of costs and expenses that we may recover in our pricing for our products, thereby reducing our future revenue and profitability.
For a further description of some of the risks associated with matters described above, see Item 1A of this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors.”
Certain Other Product and Manufacturing Regulations
After a device is placed in the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These regulatory requirements include: product listing and establishment registration; Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; labeling regulations and governmental prohibitions against the promotion of products for

uncleared, unapproved, or off-label uses or indications; clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our PMA approved devices; Medical Device Adverse Event Reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA and other foreign governmental agencies if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur; post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions, order device manufacturers to recall a product from the market that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and notices of corrections or removals.
We and certain of our suppliers also are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and European Notified Bodies to determine our compliance with the FDA’s QSR and other international regulations. If the FDA were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, the agency could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions, such as: fines and civil penalties against us, our officers, our employees, or our suppliers; delays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve our products; withdrawal or suspension of approval of our products or those of our third-party suppliers by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; product recall or seizure; interruption of production; operating restrictions; injunctions; and criminal prosecution. In addition to FDA inspections, all of our manufacturing facilities are subject to annual Notified Body inspections.
Moreover, governmental authorities outside the U.S. have become increasingly stringent in their regulation of medical devices. Our products may become subject to more rigorous regulation by non-U.S. governmental authorities in the future. Additional regulation, whether in the U.S. or internationally, may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. For a description of some of the risks associated with the regulatory requirements described above, see Item 1A of this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors.”
 Accreditation Requirements
Our subsidiary, Orthofix US LLC, has been accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care, Inc. (“ACHC”), for medical supply provider services with respect to durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (“DMEPOS”). ACHC, a private, not-for-profit corporation, which is certified to ISO 9001:2000 standards, was developed by home care and community-based providers to help companies improve business operations and quality of patient care. Although accreditation is generally a voluntary activity, where healthcare organizations submit to peer review their internal policies, processes, and patient care delivery against national standards, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) required DMEPOS suppliers to become accredited. We believe that by attaining accreditation, Orthofix US LLC has demonstrated its commitment to maintain a higher level of competency and a willingness to strive for excellence in its products, services, and customer satisfaction.
 Third-Party Payor Requirements
Our products may be reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare, or private insurance plans and healthcare networks. Third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device provided to a patient or used in a procedure does not meet applicable payment criteria or if the policyholder’s healthcare insurance benefits are limited. Also, non-government third-party payors are increasingly challenging the medical necessity and prices paid for our products and services. The Medicare program is expected to continue to implement a new payment mechanism for certain DMEPOS items via the implementation of its competitive bidding program. Bone growth therapy devices are currently exempt from this competitive bidding process.
Laws Regulating Healthcare Fraud and Abuse; State Healthcare Laws
Our sales and marketing practices are also subject to a number of U.S. laws regulating healthcare fraud and abuse, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal Physician Self-Referral Law (known as the “Stark Law”), the Civil False Claims Act, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as well as numerous state laws regulating healthcare and insurance. These laws are enforced by the Office of Inspector General within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the U.S. DOJ, and other federal, state, and local agencies. Among other things, these laws and others generally (i) prohibit the provision of anything of value in exchange for the referral of patients or for the purchase, order, or recommendation of any item or service reimbursed by a federal healthcare program (including Medicare and Medicaid); (ii) require that claims for payment submitted to federal healthcare programs be truthful; (iii) prohibit the transmission of protected healthcare information to persons not authorized to receive that information; and (iv) require the maintenance of certain government licenses and permits.
Laws Protecting the Confidentiality of Health Information
U.S. federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain health information, in particular individually identifiable information such as medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of that protected information. At the federal level, the HHS promulgates health information privacy and security rules under HIPAA. These rules protect health information by regulating its use and disclosure, including for research and other purposes. Failure of a HIPAA “covered entity” to comply with HIPAA regarding such “protected health information” could constitute a violation of federal law, subject to civil and criminal penalties. Covered entities include healthcare providers (including certain of those that sell devices or equipment) that engage in particular electronic transactions, including, as we do, the transmission of claims to health plans. Consequently, health information that we access, collect, analyze, and otherwise use and/or disclose includes protected health information that is subject to HIPAA. As noted above, many state laws also pertain to the confidentiality of health information. Such laws are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, in particular those state laws that afford greater privacy protection to the individual than HIPAA. These state laws typically have their own penalty provisions, which could be applied in the event of an unlawful action affecting health information.
In the E.U., the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. Internationally, some countries have also passed laws that require individually identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on local servers and that may restrict transfer or processing of that data.
 These laws and regulations impact the ways in which we use and manage personal data, protected health information, and our information technology systems. They also impact our ability to move, store, and access data across geographic boundaries. Compliance with these requirements may require changes in business practices, complicate our operations, and add complexity and additional management and oversight needs. They also may complicate our clinical research activities, as well as product offerings that involve transmission or use of clinical data.
 Physician Payments Sunshine Provision of the Affordable Care Act
 The Physician Payments Sunshine Provision of the Affordable Care Act (Section 6002) (the “Sunshine Act”), requires public disclosure to the U.S. government of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals, including in-kind transfers of value, such as gifts or meals. The Sunshine Act also provides penalties for non-compliance. The Sunshine Act requires that we file an annual report on March 31st of a calendar year for the transfers of value incurred for the prior calendar year.
 In 2018, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (the “SUPPORT Act”) was signed into law. The SUPPORT Act expands the reporting obligation under the Sunshine Act to include payments and other transfers of value made to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives. These expanded reporting obligations were effective for payments reported in 2022, with payment tracking beginning in 2021. Non-compliance with the Sunshine Act or SUPPORT Act is subject to civil monetary penalties.
 In addition to the Sunshine Act, as expanded by the SUPPORT Act, we seek to comply with other international and individual state transparency laws, such as the transparency laws of Massachusetts and Vermont.
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution
We have a broad sales network comprised of direct sales representatives, sales agents, and distributors. This established sales network provides us with a platform to introduce new products and expand sales of existing products. Our products are distributed in approximately 68 countries worldwide.
 Reporting Segments and Product Categories
Historically, Orthofix has managed the business by two reporting segments, Global Spine and Global Orthopedics, which account for 77% and 23%, respectively, of our total net sales in 2022. Comparatively, SeaSpine has historically managed its business as one operating segment, but with revenue reported in two product categories: (i) Biologics (formerly recognized as Orthobiologics) and (ii) Spinal Implants and Enabling Technologies. Following the merger with SeaSpine, which was completed on January 5, 2023, we

expect to reassess our reporting segments in the first quarter of 2023 based on how the operations of the newly combined company will be managed.
 
Sales Network
Our U.S. sales network is generally comprised of a mix of direct sales representatives and independent distributors, dependent upon each product category. An increasing number of these independent distributors sell products for more than one product category. Our Bone Growth Therapies product category is largely supported by a hybrid distribution network of direct sales representatives and independent distributors, whereas our Spinal Implants, Biologics, and Orthopedics sales organizations primarily consist of regional and territory business managers who oversee a broad network of independent distributors and sales agents.
We market our Enabling Technologies portfolio through a direct sales force in the U.S. that works together with our independent sales agents to generate either a capital sale or to place systems and components in an account in a capital efficient manner in return for a long-term revenue commitment for our spine and/or biologics products.
In the U.S., we typically consign our Biologics products and consign or loan our Spinal Implants and Orthopedics implant sets to hospitals and independent sales agents, who in turn deliver them to the hospital for a single surgical procedure or leave them with hospitals that are high volume users for use in multiple procedures. These sets typically contain the instruments, including disposables, and implants required to complete a surgery.
 We focus on entering distribution relationships in territories with a high potential for growth, where our partner will carry our products exclusively, except with respect to clinical markets that our products do not address. We believe these more exclusive relationships allow us to grow faster and more cost effectively in these territories over the long term. We also plan to continue to invest in additional instrument sets and marketing and education efforts to support the expansion of our independent sales agent footprint.
 Outside the U.S., we employ direct sales representatives in certain markets and also contract with independent stocking distributors, who purchase our products directly from us and independently sell them. In order to provide support to our independent sales network, we have sales and product specialists who regularly visit independent distributors to provide training and product support.
 Marketing and Product Education
 We market and sell our products principally to physicians, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, integrated health delivery systems, and other purchasing organizations.
We support our sales force and sales expansion efforts through comprehensive and specialized training workshops for physicians and sales specialists consistent with the AdvaMed Code of Ethics (“AdvaMed Code”) and the MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice (“MedTech Code”). We organize regular multilingual teaching seminars in multiple locations and also virtually. To this end, we leverage the capacity of our hands-on cadaveric training laboratories located at our Lewisville, Texas, Carlsbad, California, and Wayne, Pennsylvania facilities to increase the number of training opportunities for surgeons and sales agents. In-person trainings are also held at our facility in Verona, Italy, and in various locations in Latin America. We believe training and education will help surgeons become adept with our products and techniques, thereby improving outcomes for their patients. In recent years, thousands of surgeons from around the world have attended these in person and virtual product education seminars, which have included a variety of lectures from specialists, as well as demonstrations and hands-on workshops.

We also produce marketing and training materials, including materials outlining surgical procedures, for our customers, sales force, and distributors in a variety of languages using printed, video, and multimedia formats. We require all of our sales force, direct and independent, to undergo extensive product, policy, and compliance training to ensure adherence to our standards, policies, and applicable law.
 Competition
 The global spine, biologics, orthopedics, and image guided surgery markets are highly competitive. We face significant competition in these markets from the spine and orthopedic divisions of large multinational medical device companies, established companies focused solely or primarily on spine and orthopedics, and from smaller, emerging companies focused on product innovation. These competitors are focused on bringing new technologies to market and acquiring technologies and technology licenses that directly compete with our products or that have potential product advantages that could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive.
 Our Bone Growth Therapies product category competes principally with similar products marketed by Zimmer Biomet, DJO Global, and Bioventus. Our primary competitors in the Biologics, Enabling Technologies, and Spinal Implants markets include Alphatec Spine, Baxter, B. Braun, Brainlab, Bioventus, Cerapedics, DePuy Synthes Spine (a Johnson & Johnson company), Globus Medical, Medtronic, NuVasive, Stryker, Surgalign, XTANT Medical, ZimVie and various smaller public and private companies. For Global Orthopedics devices, our principal competitors include DePuy Synthes, Zimmer Biomet, Stryker, Smith & Nephew, and OrthoPediatrics.
We believe that we enhance our competitive position by focusing on product features such as ease of use, versatility, cost, and patient acceptability, together with value-added services, such as the STIM onTrack mobile app, HEX RAY software, OrthoNext preoperative planning, and our medical education services. We attempt to avoid competing based solely on price. Overall cost and medical effectiveness, innovation, reliability, value-added service, and training are the most prevalent methods of competition in the markets for our products, and we believe we compete effectively.
Manufacturing and Sources of Supply
 In general, raw materials essential to our businesses are readily available from multiple sources. For reasons of quality assurance, availability or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials are available only from one supplier. Our relationships with suppliers that cannot be replaced without a material expense or delay are governed by written contracts, which are generally supply agreements. These agreements set forth the process by which we order components or raw materials, as applicable, from such suppliers (which process is either on a purchase order basis or based on quarterly or annual forecasts and in some cases require us to purchase minimum amounts) and the related fees for purchasing such components or raw materials. These agreements outline the rights of each party with respect to quality assurance, inspection and compliance with applicable law and contain what we believe to be customary indemnification provisions for commercial agreements. Each of these agreements is entered into in the ordinary course of our business, is immaterial in amount and significance, and not a contract upon which our business is substantially dependent. In addition, we endeavor to maintain sufficient inventory of components and raw materials so that our production will not be significantly disrupted even if a particular component or material is not available for a period of time.
 Spine and Orthopedic Products
We generally design, develop, assemble, test, and package our bone growth stimulation, spinal implant, and orthopedic products, and subcontract the manufacturing of a substantial portion of the component parts and instruments. Although certain of our key raw materials are obtained from a single source, we believe alternate sources for these materials are available. Further, we believe an adequate inventory supply is maintained to avoid product flow interruptions. Historically, we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining the materials necessary to meet our production schedules.
Our products are currently manufactured and assembled in the U.S., Canada, and Italy. We believe our plants comply in all material respects with the requirements of the FDA and all relevant regulatory authorities outside the U.S. For a description of the laws to which we are subject, see Item 1, “Business”, under the subheadings “Corporate Compliance and Ethics Program” and “Government Regulation.” We actively monitor each of our subcontractors in order to maintain manufacturing and quality standards and product specification conformity.
Biologics
 Most of our Biologics products contain material derived from human or bovine tissue. We only source our raw materials from tissue banks registered with the FDA and accredited by the AATB. The donors are screened, tested and processed by the tissue banks in accordance with FDA and AATB requirements. Additionally, each donor must pass FDA-specified bacterial and viral testing before

raw material is distributed to us for further processing. We receive with each donor lot a certification of the safety of the raw material from the tissue bank’s medical director. As an added safety assurance, each lot of bone is released into the manufacturing process only after our quality assurance microbiologists screen the incoming bone and serology test records. During our manufacturing process, the bone particles are subjected to our proprietary process and terminally sterilized. This process is designed to support the safety and effectiveness of our DBM products.
 The collagen used in our collagen ceramic matrix products is derived only from the deep flexor tendon of cattle less than 24 months old from New Zealand. The World Health Organization classifies different types of cattle tissue for relative risk of BSE transmission. Deep flexor tendon is in the lowest-risk category for BSE transmission (the same category as milk, for example) and is therefore considered to have a negligible risk of containing the agent that causes BSE (an improperly folded protein known as a prion).
 We also partner with MTF Biologics to provide our customers allograft solutions (HCT/Ps) for various spine, orthopedic and other bone repair needs. MTF Biologics provides donor screening, processing, and quality standards that are expected by our customers. Our partnership with MTF allows us to exclusively market the Virtuos Lyograph, Trinity ELITE, FiberFuse and FiberFuse Strip, and certain other tissue forms and we have a non-exclusive marketing rights for our Opus BA and Opus MG Set synthetic, biologic offerings.
 Human Capital Resources
 Our key human capital objectives in managing our business include attracting, developing, and retaining top talent while integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion principles and practices into our core values.
Employees
 At December 31, 2022, we had 1,092 employees worldwide. Of these, 786 were employed in the U.S. and 306 were employed at other non-U.S. locations. Our relations with our Italian employees, who numbered 227 at December 31, 2022, are governed by the provisions of a National Collective Labor Agreement setting forth mandatory minimum standards for labor relations in the metal mechanic workers industry. We are not a party to any other collective bargaining agreement.
Subsequent to the merger with SeaSpine, which was completed on January 5, 2023, we have approximately 1,734 employees worldwide, with 1,371 employed in the U.S. and 363 employed at other non-U.S. locations.
Compensation and Benefits
 Because attracting, developing, and retaining high-level talent is a key component of our human capital objectives, we seek to provide competitive compensation and benefits packages, and to prioritize the health and wellness our employees. In addition to the comprehensive and competitive health plans that we offer, our employees receive access to the following benefits: a 401(k) retirement plan with a Company match, an employee stock purchase plan, virtual physician consults, an employee health advocate, a Company-provided basic life insurance and disability benefits corporate wellness program, an onsite fitness center for certain locations, paid parental leave, an employee assistance program, a flexible spending account, health savings accounts, and local employee discounts programs. Through our Innovator and Above and Beyond Award programs we recognize and reward our employees that exemplify our mission of providing transformative solutions that improve patients' lives.
Talent Development
 We believe that success comes from investing in our people and ensuring our workforce is aligned with our mission and values. To achieve this goal, we devote time and resources to assist our employees in being familiar with our business, industry, and product offerings. We have developed a robust onboarding program for our newly hired associates that provides a comprehensive overview of our product portfolio and company history. We put an emphasis on training our employees and sales representatives to understand our business, including the underlying medical conditions that our products treat. In addition, we strive to support our teams in the areas of development, mentoring, engagement, and health and wellness, enabling them to do their best work as they grow their careers. In 2022, we successfully completed our second annual summer internship program with 80% of participating interns meeting a diversity criteria. Additionally, in 2022 we matched interns hired from our 2021 program to employee mentors, continued our 2021 Leadership Excellence and Acceleration Program (“LEAP”) inaugural cohort, and prepared for a second cohort to launch in 2023, which will include a minimum of 25% minority participation.
Diversity and Inclusion
 We are committed to fostering, cultivating, and preserving a culture that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion. We seek to demonstrate our commitment to providing equal and equitable opportunities to all employees through programs such as our Moving 4ward initiative, a program created to embrace the value of diversity and reflect the communities where we live and work. Additionally, we proudly support the Orthofix Women’s Network, a program that provides opportunities for women to learn from each other and grow within our company and our industry. Throughout the year, we promote a variety of diverse voices to our employees by recognizing events such as Black History Month, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Women’s History Month, Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, LGBTQ Pride Month, Juneteenth, and Hispanic Heritage Month. We seek to embrace and encourage our employees’ differences and know that diversity, equity and inclusion help build a truly global, transformative business and will continue to be a source of our strength. Building on this belief, we launched companywide, and incorporated into our new hire orientation, a training titled, “Hiring, Leading and Fostering Diverse and Inclusive Teams”. We intend that by end of 2023, all hiring managers, leaders, and interviewers will have completed this training.
Health and Safety
 Promoting and protecting the safety of our workforce is a top priority. Health and safety matters are responsibilities that we share throughout our organization. We evolved in these matters during the last few years to meet the needs of our workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employees’ safety risks vary depending on the roles they perform, and we seek to tailor our safety efforts accordingly. We periodically measure the sentiment of our employees through an employee engagement survey and share the results and action items identified from the survey with our employees.
Community
 We support a variety of charitable organizations through donations, fundraising efforts, educational partnerships with colleges and universities, and local community development. Over the years, we have raised funds and awareness for veteran support groups, food and homebuilding organizations, and health-related institutions. In 2022, we added a corporate objective to our annual incentive program to encourage community volunteerism. Under this program, our employees contributed 1,988 hours to community outreach programs, which exceeded our communicated goal. We proudly supported Donate Life, relief efforts for Ukraine, Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children, blood drives, food pantries and other charitable initiatives in the communities we live and work in around the world.
