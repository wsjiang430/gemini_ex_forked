Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to realizing the promise of precision medicines for the treatment of cancer. Our pipeline consists of small molecule product candidates that target cancer signaling pathways where there is a strong scientific and clinical rationale to improve outcomes, and we intend to pair them with molecular or cellular diagnostics to identify those patients most likely to respond to treatment. We plan to advance our product candidates through a combination of internal development and strategic partnerships and maintain significant development and commercial rights.
 Our lead product candidate, tipifarnib, is a potent, selective and orally bioavailable inhibitor of farnesyl transferase. Tipifarnib was previously studied in more than 5,000 cancer patients and demonstrated compelling and durable anti-cancer activity in certain patients with a manageable side effect profile. We are currently evaluating tipifarnib in multiple solid tumor and hematologic indications.
 Our most advanced solid tumor indication is in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or HNSCC, that carry mutations in the HRAS gene. In September 2017, we reported that our ongoing proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib in patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC achieved its primary efficacy endpoint. Following feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and other regulatory authorities, we initiated a registration-directed clinical trial of tipifarnib in HRAS mutant HNSCC in November 2018. The global, multicenter, open label, two-cohort, non-comparative trial is designed to enroll at least 59 patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC who have received prior platinum-based therapy and is expected to take approximately two years to fully enroll. Following achievement of the primary efficacy endpoint in our proof-of-concept clinical trial of tipifarnib in patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC, we added a cohort to enroll patients having HRAS mutant squamous cell carcinomas, or SCCs, other than HNSCC. We anticipate having additional data from this Phase 2 clinical trial in the second half of 2019.
 In addition to our tipifarnib development program in HRAS mutant solid tumors, we are evaluating the potential utility of tipifarnib using CXCL12 pathway biomarkers in a number of hematologic and solid tumor indications. In December 2018, we reported preliminary data from our Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib in patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphomas, or PTCL. The data showed a significant association between CXCL12 expression and clinical benefit, as well as clinical proof-of-concept in patients with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, or AITL, an aggressive form of PTCL often characterized by high levels of CXCL12 expression. We anticipate having additional data from this study in mid-2019.
 We are also exploring the utility of CXCL12 pathway biomarkers as a strategy for patient enrichment in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or CMML, in an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial. We anticipate having additional data from the CMML clinical trial in 2019. Additionally, in January 2019, we reported the identification of a potential association between CXCL12 expression and clinical benefit from tipifarnib in patients with pancreatic cancer. We believe these findings support the potential use of tipifarnib in a broader set of hematologic and solid tumor indications, including pancreatic cancer, in which the CXCL12 pathway plays a role in tumor initiation and progression, and we are exploring opportunities for further clinical development.

Our second product candidate is KO-947, a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of extracellular signal related kinase, or ERK, which we are advancing as a potential treatment for patients with tumors that have dysregulated activity due to mutations or other mechanisms in the mitogen-activated protein kinase, or MAPK, pathway. Our preclinical data suggest that KO-947 has anti-tumor activity in KRAS- or BRAF-mutant adenocarcinomas as well as certain subsets of squamous cell carcinomas. Our Phase 1 trial of KO-947 in patients with solid tumors is ongoing, and we anticipate having data from the dose-escalation portion of the trial in 2019.
 Our third product candidate is KO-539, a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of the menin-mixed lineage leukemia, or menin-MLL, protein-protein interaction. We have generated preclinical data that support the potential anti-tumor activity of KO-539 in genetically defined subsets of acute leukemia, including those with rearrangements or partial tandem duplications in the MLL gene as well as those with oncogenic driver mutations in genes such as NPM1. Our investigational new drug, or IND, application for KO-539 has been cleared by the FDA and we anticipate initiating our Phase 1 clinical trial in relapsed or refractory AML in the second quarter of 2019.

Precision Medicines in Cancer Treatment
 Advancements in cancer genetics and new molecular diagnostic tools are helping define why some patients respond to a specific therapy while other patients receive little to no clinical benefit. This new era in cancer drug discovery and development offers the potential for innovative treatments that are safer and more effective for patients with specific cancers. We aim to improve patient outcomes and contribute to the reduction in healthcare costs by matching targeted therapeutics to the patients who will derive the most benefit. We are developing a pipeline of small molecule product candidates designed to inhibit mutated or abnormally functioning cellular pathways that drive cancer growth and intend to pair them with molecular diagnostics to identify those patients with tumors most likely to respond to treatment. This approach to treatment is known as precision medicine.
 A pioneering example of a precision medicine in cancer was the development of small molecule inhibitors against epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, in patients with advanced lung cancer. Patients with EGFR mutations treated with EGFR inhibitors have a response rate in the 65% range, as opposed to a response rate of approximately 10% in unselected lung patients. Erlotinib (Tarceva®) was approved in the United States as a first-line treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, characterized by EGFR mutations. Other examples of approved agents developed using precision medicine approaches include ALK, BCR-ABL, BRAF and TRK inhibitors.

Precision medicine has several advantages over traditional drug development. We believe evidence-based selection of patients who are more likely to respond to a targeted therapy based on tumor biology provides the potential for: higher translatability from preclinical to clinical studies; increased overall response rates, requiring fewer patients for clinical development; and expedited clinical development in areas of high unmet need. We believe the precision medicine approach has the potential for more efficient drug development with reduced risks, costs and timelines. However, achieving success through a precision medicine approach is predicated on a thorough understanding of tumor biology and the mechanism of action of the product candidate. To develop this understanding, we have conducted extensive translational research on each of our programs.
 Our Approach to Development of Precision Medicines in Oncology
 Translational research is the practice of synthesizing our knowledge of basic research, preclinical and clinical data to develop a “bench-to-bedside” understanding of the potential of our product candidates, and it is the principal methodology we utilize to guide our precision medicine approach. We evaluate our product candidates through both in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate their potential as therapeutics using a number of tools, including patient-derived xenograft, or PDX, models. PDX models mostly retain the principal histologic and genetic characteristics of their donor tumor and have been shown in many instances to be predictive of clinical outcomes and are increasingly being used for preclinical drug evaluation, biomarker identification, biologic studies and personalized medicine strategies. We evaluate our product candidates in preclinical PDX studies seeking to corroborate clinical data and to identify and prioritize potential clinical indications.
 Because we often target molecular and/or genetic alterations that are detectable, companion diagnostic tests can be developed to identify these alterations. Once we have identified a target, we will initially use existing diagnostic tools, such as next-generation sequencing, or NGS, or RNA expression profiling, to identify patient subsets that we believe will derive increased benefit from our product candidates. As we advance our product candidates clinically and determine the most important screening criteria, we intend to develop companion diagnostics as appropriate, with the help of technology partners, to seek to identify patients, and if our clinical development programs are successful, to support the potential registration and marketing of our product candidates.
 Our clinical development strategy employs a disciplined approach designed to identify response signals early in development and reduce development risks. Based upon the data from our preclinical studies as well as clinical data, we seek to evaluate our product candidates in well-defined patient populations and believe this gives us a higher likelihood of demonstrating a clinical benefit. This approach is intended to allow for early insight into the therapeutic potential of a product candidate and the possibility for rapid clinical development and expedited regulatory strategies.
 We are employing some or all of the steps above across our various programs as we advance our pipeline of targeted therapies. We believe the advantages of such an approach are the potential for higher translatability from preclinical to clinical studies, the ability to leverage clinical and pathology trends towards comprehensive tumor profiling and the potential for expedited clinical development.
 Clinical Programs and Pipeline
 Tipifarnib – An Oral Farnesyl Transferase Inhibitor
 Overview
 Tipifarnib is a member of a class of product candidates called farnesyl transferase inhibitors, or FTIs. We in-licensed tipifarnib from Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, or Janssen, an affiliate of Johnson & Johnson, in December 2014. Previously, tipifarnib was studied in more than 5,000 oncology patients in more than 70 clinical trials and was observed to be generally well tolerated with a manageable side effect profile as a single agent. Although tipifarnib has a well-established safety profile and has demonstrated compelling and durable anti-cancer activity in certain patients, its activity has not been sufficient in any prior clinical trial to support marketing approval by the FDA. However, clinical and preclinical data suggest that, in certain selected patient populations, tipifarnib has the potential to provide significant benefit to cancer patients with limited treatment options. We have worldwide rights to tipifarnib in all indications other than virology.

Protein Farnesylation and Tipifarnib
 Tipifarnib is a potent and selective inhibitor of protein farnesylation. Certain cellular proteins must associate with the intracellular membrane to function. One of the mechanisms by which proteins are associated with the inner cell membrane is farnesylation, which modifies the protein by attaching a farnesyl group. Another, related mechanism of attachment of proteins to the membrane is protein geranylgeranylation, which is attachment of a geranylgeranyl group to the protein. Protein farnesylation and protein geranylgeranylation, collectively called protein prenylation, cause intracellular proteins to become anchored to the inside of the cell membrane due to the hydrophobic nature of the farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups.
 The enzyme that catalyzes the attachment of the farnesyl groups to proteins is called farnesyl transferase. Small molecule inhibitors of the farnesyl transferase enzyme have been discovered, and several inhibitors including tipifarnib have been evaluated in human clinical trials. The small molecule inhibitors are commonly referred to as FTIs. Many proteins involved in cellular signaling undergo prenylation because they must be associated with other proteins at the inner cellular membrane of the tumor cell to function properly. Treatment of tumors with FTIs results in the reversal of several hallmarks of cancer, including mitotic arrest, induction of apoptosis, growth inhibition, tissue invasion, sustained angiogenesis and tumor growth, as well as induction of tumor regression in animal models.
 Among the hundreds of proteins estimated to be prenylated, some are either exclusively farnesylated or exclusively geranylgeranylated; some are both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated, and others are naturally farnesylated but become geranylgeranylated, when the farnesyl transferase enzyme is inhibited. HRAS is an example of a protein that is exclusively farnesylated while KRAS and NRAS are two proteins that are naturally farnesylated but may become geranylgeranylated upon treatment with FTIs.
 Solid Tumors with HRAS Mutations
 Retrovirus-associated DNA sequences, or RAS, are a family of membrane-associated proteins that are involved in regulating cell division in response to growth factor stimulation. HRAS is a member of the RAS family, which includes the other proto-oncogenes: KRAS and NRAS. Collectively, the three RAS genes constitute one of the most frequently mutated families of oncogenes in human cancers. Although HRAS mutations are less common overall relative to KRAS and NRAS mutations in human cancers, they have a higher prevalence in cancers of the upper digestive tract, skin, thyroid and urinary bladder.
 The HRAS protein is involved in regulating cell division in response to growth factor stimulation. Growth factors act by binding cell surface receptors that span the cell’s plasma membrane. Once activated, receptors stimulate signal transduction events in the cytoplasm, a process by which proteins and second messengers relay signals from outside the cell to the cell nucleus and instruct the cell to grow or divide. HRAS is localized in the plasma membrane, and it is an early player in many signal transduction pathways. HRAS acts as a molecular on/off switch – once HRAS is turned “on” it recruits and activates proteins necessary for the propagation of the receptor’s signal. In certain tumors, mutations in HRAS or its upstream regulators cause HRAS to be permanently “on,” resulting in persistent activation of downstream growth and proliferation signals that drive tumor cell growth. FTIs work to prevent the aberrant growth and proliferation of cells that are dependent on these signaling pathways by inhibiting protein farnesylation and subsequent membrane localization of HRAS, thereby switching HRAS “off.” HRAS membrane localization is solely dependent on protein farnesylation, and therefore we believe that tipifarnib has the potential for the treatment of HRAS mutant solid tumors.
 HNSCC is one of a number of different types of cancer that arises from squamous cells. Squamous cells are found in the outer layer of skin and in the mucous membranes, which are the moist tissues that line body cavities such as the airways and intestines. HNSCC develops in the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and throat and is classified by its location. HNSCC is caused by a variety of factors that can alter the DNA in cells. The strongest risk factors for developing this form of cancer are tobacco use, including smoking or using chewing tobacco, and heavy alcohol consumption. In addition, infection with certain strains of human papillomavirus, or HPV, is linked to the development of HNSCC.
 HNSCC is a disease of high unmet need. Response rates for the three approved second-line agents, cetuximab (Erbitux®), nivolumab (Opdivo®) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) are in the range of 13-16% in unselected populations, with a median progression-free survival of approximately two months and a median overall survival of fewer than eight months. Data in the literature suggest response rates in patients with HRAS mutations may be even lower.
 Other types of cancer that can result from squamous cells include vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, penile squamous cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma. Our preclinical and clinical data

suggest that, among solid tumors with HRAS mutations, squamous cell tumors are sensitive tumors to treatment with tipifarnib, and treatment with tipifarnib can, in some patients, produce durable responses.
 Clinical Development of Tipifarnib in HRAS Mutant Solid Tumors
 Proof-of-Concept Trial in HNSCC and other SCCs. We initiated a proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial in May 2015 to test the hypothesis whether tipifarnib could be used as a treatment for advanced tumors with HRAS mutations. The initiation of this clinical study was based on our preclinical data, which demonstrated that tipifarnib inhibits HRAS mutant cell proliferation and HRAS tumor growth in mouse models. The clinical study was originally designed to enroll two cohorts of 18 patients each, with a primary endpoint of objective response rate and tumor response assessments conducted according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1, or RECIST 1.1, criteria with confirmation of response required.
 Cohort 1 enrolled patients with malignant thyroid tumors with HRAS mutations, independently of thyroid histology. Ten evaluable patients have been enrolled in Stage 1 of Cohort 1. Although evidence of prolonged disease stabilization was observed in several patients, we saw no objective responses within the first stage of the thyroid cohort and the cohort was closed to further enrollment. Cohort 2 was initially designed to enroll any patient with a non-hematological HRAS mutant tumor other than thyroid cancer who meets the eligibility criteria. In March 2017, we presented preliminary data from this trial at the 15th International Congress on Targeted Anticancer Therapies, including data from a cohort of three patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC treated with tipifarnib, two of whom achieved confirmed partial responses, or PRs. Based upon these data, we amended the clinical study protocol to focus enrollment in Cohort 2 entirely on patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC. 
 In September 2017, we reported that our proof-of-concept clinical trial of tipifarnib in patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC achieved its primary efficacy endpoint with four confirmed, partial responses among the first six evaluable HNSCC patients enrolled in the trial. Following achievement of the primary efficacy endpoint in patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC, we further amended the clinical study protocol to add a third cohort with patients having HRAS mutant SCCs other than HNSCC.
 In October 2018, we reported updated data from our proof-of-concept clinical trial of tipifarnib in patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC and preliminary data in our cohort of other HRAS mutant SCCs at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2018 Congress. As of the September 7, 2018 clinical data cutoff date, 17 patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC were enrolled in the trial. Tumor size reductions were observed in nine of 11 evaluable patients, with five confirmed partial responses, including three patients with durable responses lasting more than 17 months. A sixth patient achieved a confirmed PR after the data cutoff. Four patients had stable disease, including two patients who experienced prolonged disease stabilization lasting more than six months. Only one patient experienced progressive disease as best response. An additional patient with HRAS mutant HNSCC dosed off-protocol was reported as an unconfirmed partial response with a 40% tumor size reduction at first assessment.
 Patients in our proof-of-concept clinical trial of tipifarnib in HRAS mutant HNSCC had a median of two prior lines of therapy (range 1-5), with confirmed responses observed in patients who had progressed on cetuximab regimens, immunotherapy or both. Patients received oral doses ranging from 600 mg to 900 mg twice daily on days 1-7 and 14-21 of 28-day cycles. Dose-limiting, treatment-emergent adverse events included hematological events and gastrointestinal disturbances, which were managed by dose interruption and/or dose reduction. 
 In addition, six patients were enrolled in our cohort of other HRAS mutant SCCs as of the September 7, 2018 clinical data cutoff date. One of the two evaluable patients in this cohort achieved a confirmed partial response and the other achieved prolonged disease stabilization lasting more than eight months. Four patients were not evaluable as of the data cutoff date, including two patients who were pending initial efficacy assessments.
 An analysis of available tumor biopsy samples from patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC or other SCCs enrolled in our proof-of-concept clinical trial showed a significant association between tumor HRAS mutant allele frequency, or the measurement of mutated HRAS encoding DNA in a patient’s tumor compared to wild type HRAS DNA, and clinical benefit in patients treated with tipifarnib. Of the 14 HNSCC or other SCC patients with a tumor HRAS mutant allele frequency greater than 20%, seven achieved PRs, one achieved an unconfirmed PR and two experienced disease stabilization greater than six months. No meaningful clinical benefit was observed in the seven patients with an allele frequency less than 20%. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas indicate that approximately 5% of HNSCC patients have an HRAS mutant allele frequency greater than 20%.

Following the data update in October 2018, we modified our ongoing proof-of-concept clinical trial of tipifarnib in patients with other HRAS mutant SCCs to introduce a minimum tumor HRAS mutant allele frequency as an entry criterion and use 600 mg orally twice daily as the starting dose. We anticipate having additional data from this trial in the second half of 2019.
 Registration-Directed Trial in HRAS Mutant HNSCC. Based on the positive results observed in our proof-of-concept clinical trial, and following feedback from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, we initiated a global, multi-center, open-label, registration-directed clinical trial in recurrent or metastatic patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC in November 2018. The trial has two cohorts: A non-interventional screening and outcomes cohort, which we call SEQ-HN, and a treatment cohort, which we call AIM-HN.
 SEQ-HN is designed as a case-control study to determine the treatment outcomes of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC with HRAS mutations. The primary objective of SEQ-HN is to determine the objective response rate of first-line therapy in patients with HNSCC that carry HRAS mutations compared to those without a known HRAS mutation. In addition, this screening and outcomes cohort is expected to enable the identification of patients with HRAS mutations for potential enrollment into AIM-HN.
 AIM-HN is designed to enroll at least 59 patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC who have received prior platinum-based therapy, and the trial is expected to take approximately two years to fully enroll. Based on observations from our proof-of-concept clinical trial, patients in AIM-HN must have a tumor HRAS mutant allele frequency greater than or equal to 35%, or greater than or equal to 20% if the patient’s serum albumin level is greater than or equal to 3.5 g/dL. Patients enrolled in the trial will receive a starting dose of 600 mg of oral tipifarnib, twice daily, on days 1-7 and 15-21 of 28-day treatment cycles. The trial’s primary endpoint is objective response rate, as determined using RECIST 1.1 criteria and confirmed by independent radiological review. AIM-HN has approximately 80% power to detect a difference between a null hypothesis of 15%, which is the point estimate of the objective response rate of second-line therapy for recurrent and metastatic disease, and 30%, an objective response rate considered of interest. Based on feedback from the FDA, we believe that AIM-HN, if positive, may be adequate to support a new drug application, or NDA, seeking accelerated approval.
 Investigator-Sponsored Trials in HRAS Mutant Solid Tumors. In addition to our company-sponsored clinical trials in HRAS mutant solid tumors, an investigator-sponsored clinical trial of tipifarnib for the treatment HRAS mutant lung squamous cell carcinoma is ongoing. This proof-of-concept clinical trial is being conducted by Grupo Español de Cáncer de Pulmón, or GECP, a Spanish lung cancer consortium, and is designed to enroll at least 18 patients. The primary endpoint of this clinical trial will be objective response rate, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, duration of response and safety.
 An investigator-sponsored clinical trial of tipifarnib is also being conducted for the treatment of advanced, previously treated urothelial carcinomas that carry HRAS mutations. This proof-of-concept clinical trial is sponsored by the Samsung Medical Center in Korea and is designed to enroll at least 18 patients. The primary endpoint of this clinical trial is objective response rate, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, duration of response and safety.
 Companion Diagnostics for Tipifarnib in HRAS Mutant Solid Tumors. Patients are currently being enrolled in the ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept HRAS mutant tumor clinical trial and our AIM-HN clinical trial based either upon information on the patients’ tumor HRAS mutation status obtained by the clinical sites from NGS panels used by the site, or upon information obtained from third-party laboratories who conduct genetic screening on patient samples for the clinical sites. Working with our collaborators, we have obtained an investigational device exemption, or IDE, for use of a qualitative polymerase chain reaction, or qPCR, -based assay as a companion diagnostic test for our AIM-HN clinical trial. We expect that regulatory approval of tipifarnib as a treatment for patients with HRAS mutant tumors will require FDA approval of an HRAS assay in the form of a companion diagnostic test that has been validated for accuracy, precision and reproducibility.
 Registration Strategy for Tipifarnib in HRAS Mutant Solid Tumors. Our immediate strategy for tipifarnib in HRAS mutant solid tumors is to generate a data package to support an application for marketing approval in HRAS mutant HNSCC. We will also seek to broaden tipifarnib’s potential use in other HRAS mutant solid tumors, including HRAS mutant SCCs other than HNSCC, as we believe this may represent a near-term opportunity to expand the use of tipifarnib into a broader set of HRAS mutant cancers. Longer term, our development strategy for tipifarnib is to advance toward earlier lines of therapy and, ultimately, to treat patients with HRAS mutant SCCs in the continuum of systemic treatment settings.

Clinical Development of Tipifarnib Using CXCL12 Pathway Biomarkers
 We are evaluating the potential utility of tipifarnib using CXCL12 pathway biomarkers in both hematologic and solid tumor indications. Our interest in these indications stems, in part, from prior clinical data obtained by Janssen and independent investigators, which demonstrated that tipifarnib can drive meaningful clinical benefit, including examples of objective responses, and in some cases complete responses. However, although tipifarnib demonstrated evidence of clinical activity in both hematologic and solid tumor settings such as PTCL, AML and pancreatic cancer, no molecular mechanism of action was identified at that time that could explain its activity in those patient populations and that could allow for a strategy to identify those patients most likely to benefit from treatment with tipifarnib. 
 In June 2017, we presented preliminary results from our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib in PTCL, identifying the CXCL12 pathway as a potential therapeutic target of tipifarnib. CXCL12 is a chemokine that is expressed primarily by immune cells, endothelial cells and stromal fibroblasts that constitute the tumor microenvironment. CXCL12 and its receptors, CXCR4 and CXCR7, are key factors linking cancer cells with the tumor microenvironment. Among its multiple functions, CXCL12 has been shown to be essential for homing of myeloid cells to the bone marrow and lymphoid cells to lymph nodes and other organs. Based on our initial observations of the role of CXCL12 as a potential biomarker of clinical activity in PTCL, we began to investigate the role of the CXCL12 pathway in other indications.
 In December 2017, at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition, or ASH, we also presented new findings that identified activation of the CXCL12 pathway and bone marrow homing of myeloid cells as potential biomarkers of tipifarnib activity. The results were obtained by analyzing data from previous clinical trials of tipifarnib in AML and myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, as well as data from our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib in CMML. We believe that these data all implicate the CXCL12 pathway in the activity of tipifarnib. Moreover, when we retrospectively stratify the patients on the basis of activation markers of the CXCL12 pathway, we observe clinical benefit that is consistent across different endpoints, treatment settings and indications. We are now working to further validate CXCL12 as a therapeutic target of tipifarnib in a number of indications.
 Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma/Angioimmunoblastic T-Cell Lymphoma. Lymphoma is the most common blood cancer. The two main forms of lymphoma are Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or HL, and Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or NHL. PTCL consists of a group of rare and usually aggressive, fast-growing NHLs that develop from mature T-cells. PTCLs are sub-classified into various subtypes, each of which are typically considered to be separate diseases based on their distinct clinical differences. Most of these subtypes are rare; two of the most common are AITL and PTCL not otherwise specified, or PTCL-NOS.
 Despite several approvals over the past decade, the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory PTCL remains a significant unmet medical need. Three of the more recent launches, pralatrexate (Folotyn®), romidepsin (Istodax®) and belinostat (Beleodaq®), were approved based on single-arm clinical trials of fewer than 130 patients, each with response rates in the range of 25-27% and only two to three months of median progression-free survival in unselected populations.
 We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in September 2015 to evaluate the hypothesis that tipifarnib can be used as a treatment for relapsed or refractory PTCL. The Phase 2 clinical trial was initially designed to investigate the anti-tumor activity of tipifarnib in 18 patients with advanced PTCL. The primary endpoint is objective response rate, and tumor response assessments are conducted according to the International Workshop Criteria for the assessment of responses in lymphoma. 
 In December 2017, we reported updated, preliminary data from our Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib in an unselected population of patients with PTCL at ASH. The results of the study, which was conducted in patients having a median of four prior lines of therapy, showed that patients having elevated levels of CXCL12 gene expression and/or the absence of a single nucleotide variation in the 3'-untranslated region, or 3'-UTR, of the CXCL12 gene, or CXCL12+, had a higher rate of clinical benefit in terms of objective response rate and progression-free survival in this advanced patient population. Of the three partial responses in the study, two occurred in the three patients on study with AITL. These findings are consistent with published data that show patients with AITL express high levels of CXCL12. Based upon these observations, we started enrolling two expansion cohorts in PTCL patients, the first in patients with AITL histology, and the second in patients with CXCL12 high PTCL, other than AITL.
 In December 2018, we reported preliminary data from the two expansion cohorts in our Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL at ASH. The data showed a significant association between CXCL12 expression and clinical benefit, as well as proof-of-concept in AITL. As of the November 21, 2018 data cutoff date, a total of 39 patients were enrolled in the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial, including 19 patients with AITL (16 patients in the AITL extension cohort and 3 patients in the previous portion of the study). Six of the 16 AITL patients were not evaluable as of the data cutoff date, including two who were pending initial efficacy assessments. Of the 13 evaluable AITL patients, two

achieved a complete response and four achieved a partial response, for an objective response rate of 46% (six of 13). According to the study protocol, the AITL cohort is considered positive when four or more responses are observed.
 The study also identified a particularly responsive subset within AITL and non-AITL patients. Specifically, patients with a high ratio of expression of CXCL12 to its receptor CXCR4 experienced an objective response rate of 50% (five of 10) and a clinical benefit rate of 90% (nine of 10 with either complete response, partial response or stable disease) with tipifarnib. Patients in this Phase 2 clinical trial had a median of three prior lines of therapy (range 1-7). High expression of CXCL12 was observed in approximately 40% of the PTCL patients. The high CXCL12/CXCR4 expression ratio had 90% sensitivity and 93% specificity to identify PTCL patients likely to benefit from tipifarnib. We anticipate additional data from this Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib in mid-2019 including duration of response data from the AITL cohort and additional data from the CXCL12 high PTCL cohort.
 In addition to the Phase 2 clinical data, the results from two ancillary, non-clinical studies were also reported at ASH. In the first, the expression of CXCL12 and CXCR4 was investigated using tumor bank samples of PTCL patients treated with standard-of-care agents. Worse prognosis was observed in PTCL patients with high CXCL12/CXCR4 expression ratio, suggesting that CXCL12 is a negative prognostic factor for standard PTCL therapy. In the second study, the effect of the incubation of stroma cells with tipifarnib on CXCL12 secretion was investigated in a mouse model of bone marrow culture. Tipifarnib reduced secretion of the CXCL12 chemokine from the stromal cells, providing a potential mechanism of action for the observed clinical activity.
 Other Hematologic Malignancies. We are also evaluating tipifarnib in other hematological malignancies, including CMML and AML. CMML is a disorder of bone marrow stem cells in which an increase in white blood cells, or monocytosis, is a defining feature. The clinical presentation of CMML varies from predominantly myelodysplastic, an ineffective production of blood cells, to predominantly myeloproliferative, an overproduction of blood cells. AML is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts, a type of white blood cell, red blood cells or platelets. In prior clinical studies conducted by Janssen and independent investigators, tipifarnib has demonstrated clinical responses in adults with refractory and relapsed AML, in older adults with newly diagnosed poor-risk AML and in patients with poor-risk MDS. However, the activity of tipifarnib in those studies was not sufficient to support registration of tipifarnib.
 In December 2017, we reported preliminary results from our Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib in CMML at ASH. The primary objective of the study was met with three objective responses in nine evaluable patients with KRAS or NRAS wild-type CMML, for an overall response rate of 33%. Although the signal observed in RAS wild-type patients is encouraging, our discovery of potential CXCL12 pathway biomarkers has shifted our focus in CMML to the evaluation of other potential biomarkers of activity for tipifarnib in CMML, including activation of the CXCL12 pathway.
 Our analyses of data from our ongoing clinical trial in CMML, as well as data from prior clinical trials sponsored by Janssen and others in AML and MDS, has identified activation of the CXCL12 pathway, as measured by the ratio of CXCR4/CXCR2 gene expression and bone marrow homing of myeloid cells, as a potential biomarker of tipifarnib activity in patients with AML in addition to CMML. As such, we amended our Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with CMML to include prospectively cohorts of relapsed and/or refractory MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasia, or MPN, including CMML and AML patients with elevated levels of CXCL12 pathway biomarkers. Our initial focus in this trial is on the CMML cohort. Additionally, our analysis of gene expression from bone marrow samples in 27 previously untreated poor-risk and elderly AML patients who were treated with tipifarnib in a prior Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, or CTEP 20, Phase 2 clinical trial indicated a potential association between high CXCL12 expression and clinical activity in these patients.
 Our goals are to validate the utility of CXCL12 pathway biomarkers as a strategy for patient enrichment in relapsed/refractory myeloid tumor indications starting in CMML and other MDS/MPN overlap syndromes, and then to extend the potential use of tipifarnib to other myeloid indications and settings.
 We have also been evaluating CXCL12 pathway markers in our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib in MDS to determine whether they could be of utility for patient selection. Given our current focus in HRAS mutant solid tumors and other CXCL12 pathway indications, our Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib in MDS has been deprioritized and is not currently enrolling new patients. Additional opportunities for future development of tipifarnib in other potential CXCL12-expressing indications may include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma and mycosis fungoides, a form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Responses were observed in each of these indications in a National Cancer Institute-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib in unselected patients with other relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies. 
 Solid Tumors. Elevated CXCL12 expression is known to be a poor prognosis factor in patients with certain solid tumors, including pancreatic, lung and esophageal-gastric cancers. In the specific context of pancreatic cancer, high CXCL12 
 
9


expressing tumors may evade early diagnosis by decreasing abdominal pain through the attraction of pain-suppressing Schwann cells. To investigate the potential for association between CXCL12 expression and clinical benefit in pancreatic cancer patients, we conducted a retrospective analysis of study INT-11, a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of gemcitabine plus tipifarnib compared with gemcitabine plus placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer conducted by Janssen. In January 2019, we presented new findings at the 2019 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium identifying a potential association between CXCL12 expression and clinical benefit in patients with pancreatic cancer treated with tipifarnib.
 A total of 688 pancreatic cancer patients were enrolled in study INT-11, of whom 155 reported no abdominal pain at study entry. Although no differences in survival were observed in the overall study, the absence of patient-reported abdominal pain at study entry was associated with higher median survival in the tipifarnib plus gemcitabine arm (10.2 months vs. 5.9 months, hazard ratio, or HR=0.52, p<0.0001), whereas no significant effect was observed in the placebo plus gemcitabine arm (6.0 months vs. 6.1 months), suggesting that the absence of abdominal pain may serve as a surrogate of CXCL12 expression and related clinical benefit from tipifarnib in pancreatic cancer.
 In addition, patients with nodal disease or distant metastases limited to the liver also appeared more likely to receive clinical benefit from tipifarnib. Significant clinical benefit was observed in 67 patients with nodal metastases (12.8 months vs. 8.2 months, HR=0.46, p=0.01) and in 233 patients with liver only metastases (6.8 months vs. 5.0 months, HR=0.7, p=0.02), respectively. Nodal and liver metastases of pancreatic cancer were, in separate analyses, found to express high levels of CXCL12.
 Analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, or TCGA, we also found an association between high CXCL12 expression and pancreatic tumors with low KRAS mutant allele frequency (≤ 5%, representing approximately 30% of pancreatic cancer patients). This observation may lead to the use of KRAS mutant allele frequency as a tool which may help identify patients with tumors overexpressing CXCL12 and more likely to respond to tipifarnib therapy. We believe these findings support the development of tipifarnib in pancreatic cancer and we are exploring opportunities for conducting a proof-of-concept study in this indication.
 Companion Diagnostics for Tipifarnib Using CXCL12 Biomarkers. If the results of any of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials in CXCL12-driven indications are positive, and any of our potential CXCL12 pathway biomarkers, such as the absence of a single nucleotide variation in the 3'-UTR of the CXCL12 gene in PTCL patients or the ratio of expression of the CXCR4/CXCR2 genes in CMML study, are shown to be predictive of response to tipifarnib, we would expect to partner development and validation of a companion diagnostic test to aid in the selection of patients in subsequent clinical trials of tipifarnib in the respective patient populations. Genetic assays detecting the absence of a single nucleotide variation in the 3'-UTR of the CXCL12 gene are already available.
 Registration Strategy for Tipifarnib Using CXCL12 Biomarkers. The objective of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials of tipifarnib in CXCL12-driven indications is to confirm the clinical activity of tipifarnib, validate biomarker hypotheses and optimize dose and schedule for each disease to inform whether to proceed to registration-enabling studies. For each disease indication, we plan to evaluate a number of criteria in determining whether to advance tipifarnib. These criteria include: biomarker validation, evidence of durable, clinical benefit, potential for rapid clinical development, potential to move into earlier lines of therapy, the potential for patent and regulatory exclusivity and the commercial potential.KO-947 – A Potent Inhibitor of ERK1/2
 We are advancing KO-947, a small molecule inhibitor of ERK, as a potential treatment for patients with tumors that have dysregulated activity due to mutations or other mechanisms in the MAPK pathway, including lung cancers, colorectal cancers and pancreatic cancers. We dosed the first patient in our Phase 1 clinical trial of KO-947 in April 2017. We acquired KO-947 from Araxes Pharma LLC, or Araxes, a private biopharmaceutical company.
 KO-947, demonstrates potent inhibition of the ERK kinase and high selectivity relative to a panel of approximately 400 kinases. KO-947 also demonstrates prolonged inhibition of the MAPK pathway in vivo. Following a single dose in vivo, KO-947 demonstrated a near complete inhibition of MAPK pathway signaling for more than 72 hours. The prolonged inhibition of the pathway supports the potential for intermittent dosing schedules.
 KO-947 has been evaluated in a panel of more than 200 different PDX models comprising 20 different clinical indications, utilizing intermittent dosing, to identify and prioritize potential lead clinical indications. Preclinical data presented at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting, or AACR, in April 2017 showed that KO-947 
 
10


demonstrated robust and durable activity, including tumor regressions, in lung, colorectal and pancreatic tumors harboring KRAS and BRAF mutations and in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and esophagus and lacking mutations in the MAPK pathway. In each of these subsets of tumors characterized by mutation or dysregulation of the MAPK pathway, KO-947 demonstrated response rates of greater than 50%. Through our preclinical studies, we have identified potential development opportunities including KRAS and BRAF mutant cancers and squamous cell carcinomas. In addition, we have identified potential biomarkers to enable patient selection strategies for clinical development.
 In April 2018, we presented preclinical data at AACR, including the identification of 11q13 amplification as a potential biomarker of activity for KO-947 in squamous cell carcinomas. Amplification of chromosomal region 11q13 is a common genetic alteration in squamous cell carcinomas, comprising approximately 20% of HNSCC and approximately 50% of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
 We initiated our Phase 1 clinical trial of KO-947 in April 2017. The trial is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, of KO-947 in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic, relapsed and/or refractory, non-hematological malignancies. If an MTD cannot be identified, a recommended Phase 2 dose will be determined. In addition, extension cohorts may be conducted to further characterize the safety and tolerability of KO-947 and seek to provide preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity. Currently, two tumor-specific cohorts, NSCLC adenocarcinomas with mutations in KRAS or BRAF and squamous cell carcinomas, have been identified as potential extension cohorts. We are evaluating a number of doses and schedules and anticipate having data from the dose-escalation portion of our Phase 1 clinical trial in 2019.
 KO-539 – A Selective Inhibitor of the Menin-MLL Interaction
 We are developing orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitors of the menin-MLL interaction for the treatment of genetically defined subsets of acute leukemias, including AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL. The menin-MLL program was licensed from the Regents of The University of Michigan, or the University of Michigan. Our IND application for KO-539 has been cleared by the FDA and we anticipate initiating our Phase 1 clinical trial in relapsed or refractory AML in the second quarter of 2019.
 MLL-rearranged, or MLL-r, leukemias, are characterized by chromosomal translocations of the MLL gene that are primarily found in patients with AML and ALL and affect both children and adults. These translocations form oncogenes encoding MLL fusion proteins, which play a causative role in the onset, development and progression of MLL-r leukemias. MLL fusion proteins drive the up-regulation of expression of small set of target genes involved in the malignant transformation of blood cells, however, the fusion protein is critically dependent on binding the oncogenic co-factor menin to function. This implies that the menin-MLL interaction represents a valuable target for molecular therapy and supports the development of inhibitors of the menin-MLL protein-protein interaction.
 The target genes of the MLL fusion proteins are also found to be overexpressed in a broader subset of AMLs characterized by mutations in NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2 and a different mutation in the MLL gene, known as a MLL-partial tandem duplication, or MLL-PTD. These mutations also appear to be dependent on the interaction between menin and MLL, suggesting that the menin-MLL complex is a central node in epigenetic dysregulation driven by distinct oncogenic driver mutations known to be important in AML and other hematologic malignancies.
 In preclinical studies, KO-539 has demonstrated potent and selective inhibition of the proliferation of MLL-r leukemia cell lines. In November 2017, we reported preclinical data at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics showing robust and durable efficacy in multiple in vivo models of AML characterized by MLL-rearrangements or mutations in NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH1 and IDH2. We have further demonstrated that the inhibition of the menin-MLL interaction results in the down-regulation of MLL fusion target genes and an up-regulation of markers of differentiation.

License and Asset Purchase Agreements
 Janssen Pharmaceutica NV
 In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Janssen, which was amended in June 2016, which grants us exclusive global rights to develop and commercialize tipifarnib in all indications other than virology and includes the right to grant sublicenses. We are obligated under the license agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tipifarnib and, with the exception of the transfer to us without cost of Janssen’s existing inventory of tipifarnib material, we are responsible for all future development and commercialization costs for tipifarnib. Under the license agreement, Janssen had a first right to negotiate for an exclusive license back from us to develop and commercialize tipifarnib on terms to be negotiated in good faith, which Janssen could exercise during the 60-day period following completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib in HRAS mutant patients in oncology and delivery by us to Janssen of a complete data package from such clinical trial. In June 2018, Janssen declined to exercise this first right to negotiate.
 Under the terms of the license agreement, in January 2015 we issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $1.0 million to Johnson & Johnson Innovation—JJDC, Inc., which automatically converted into shares of common stock in our March 2015 private placement. When and if commercial sales of tipifarnib begin, we are obligated to pay Janssen tiered royalties of low double digit percentages of our net sales, depending on the amount of our net sales, with standard provisions for royalty offsets in the event of generic competition or compulsory licenses, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the licensed patents covering the licensed product in the field in such country the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity with respect to such product in such country, and ten years from our first commercial sale. We are also required to make regulatory milestone payments to Janssen of up to $25.0 million in the aggregate, if specified regulatory approvals are achieved for the first indication and additional payments for each subsequent indication if specified regulatory approvals are achieved. In addition, we are required to make sales milestone payments of up to $50.0 million in the aggregate if specified sales thresholds are surpassed. If we grant sublicenses under the license from Janssen, we are required to pay to Janssen
 a percentage of any upfront, lump-sum or milestone payments received from our sublicensee, subject to certain exclusions for regulatory milestone payments due under the license agreement.
 The license agreement with Janssen will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty and sublicense revenue obligations to Janssen, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the license agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the license agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Janssen can terminate the license agreement, resulting in a loss of our licensed rights to tipifarnib.
 Araxes Pharma LLC
 In December 2014, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Araxes, which was amended and restated in February 2015, under which we purchased all of Araxes’ patent rights in its ERK inhibitor program, including KO-947 and additional backup compounds, and related intellectual property. When and if commercial sales of a product candidate covered by the purchased patent rights begin, we are obligated to pay Araxes tiered royalties of low single digit percentages of our net sales, depending on the amount of our net sales with standard provisions for royalty offsets. We are also required to make development and regulatory milestone payments to Araxes of up to $9.7 million in the aggregate if specified development events and regulatory approvals are achieved. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, in December 2014 we issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $0.5 million to Araxes, which automatically converted into shares of common stock in our March 2015 private placement.
The University of Michigan
 In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Michigan, which was amended in March 2015, July 2015, September 2016, February 2017, May 2017 and August 2017, which grants us exclusive worldwide rights under certain patent rights to compounds in our menin-MLL program. Under this license agreement, we paid the University of Michigan an upfront nonrefundable license fee and are obligated to pay the University of Michigan annual license maintenance fees. We are also required to make development and regulatory milestone payments to the University of Michigan of up to $3.4 million in the aggregate if specified development and regulatory events are achieved for the first indication and additional payments for each subsequent indication. If we grant sublicenses under the license from the University of Michigan, we are required to pay the University of Michigan a percentage of certain amounts received from the sublicenses. When and if commercial sales of products covered by the licensed patent rights begin, we are obligated to pay the University of Michigan tiered royalties of low single digit percentages of our net sales depending on the amount of our 
 
12


net sales with standard provision for royalty offsets and sales-based milestones. All future development, regulatory and commercial work on the licensed compounds will be completed fully by us and at our sole expense. The University of Michigan retains the right to use the licensed compounds for non-commercial research, internal and/or educational purposes, with the right to grant the same limited rights to other non-profit research institutions. Under the agreement, as a result of our March 2015 private placement, we issued to the University of Michigan 79,113 shares of our common stock at a fair value of $0.5 million. The license agreement with the University of Michigan will terminate upon the last-to-expire patent rights, or may be terminated by us at any time with 90 days written notice of termination or terminated by the University of Michigan upon a bankruptcy by us, payment failure by us that is not cured within 30 days or a material breach of the agreement by us that is not cured within 60 days.
 Competition
 The development and commercialization of new products to treat cancer is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Although we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies worldwide. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
 We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and we will face competition with respect to future product candidates, from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue approaches to targeting molecular alterations and signaling pathways associated with cancer. Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, less costly or possessing better safety profiles than our products, and these competitors may be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.
 In addition, we will need to develop our product candidates in collaboration with diagnostic companies and will face competition from other companies in establishing these collaborations. Our competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy or a combination of such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a premium over competitive generic, including branded generic, products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.
 
13


Tipifarnib Competition
 Although there are currently no approved drugs targeting farnesyl transferase, we are aware of several compounds that are now or have previously been in clinical development, including Merck’s lonafarnib, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s BMS-214662, Astellas Pharma’s, formerly OSI Pharmaceuticals, CP-609,754, and AstraZeneca’s AZD3409. To our knowledge, there are no ongoing clinical trials evaluating any of these agents for the treatment of cancer. However, the initiation of clinical development of another of these agents in an oncology setting could become competitively significant, and if tipifarnib or our other product candidates do not offer sustainable advantages over competing products, we may not be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors.
 Even if we are successful in developing our product candidates, the resulting products would compete with a variety of established drugs in each targeted therapeutic indication. Although there are currently no drugs approved specifically for the treatment of HRAS-mutant solid tumors, there are several targeted therap
ies approved for the treatment of HNSCC, including Eli Lilly’s/Merck KGaA’s cetuximab (Erbitux®), Bristol Myers Squibb’s nivolumab (Opdivo®) and Merck’s pembrolizumab (Keytruda®), and Sq-NSCLC, including Keytruda, Opdivo, Roche’s atezolizumab (Tencentriq®)and Eli Lilly’s ramucirumab (Cyramza®). While there are no approved drugs targeting CXCL12, we are aware of Noxxon’s olaptesed pegol, currently in clinical development. Competitive drugs currently approved for PTCL include belinostat (Beleodaq®) and pralatrexate (Folotyn®), marketed by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, romidepsin (Istodax®), marketed by Celgene, and brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris®) for anaplastic large cell lymphoma, marketed by Seattle Genetics. There are no targeted therapies approved for the treatment of CMML.
 ERK Inhibitor Competition
 While there are currently no approved drugs targeting ERK, we are aware of several compounds that are in clinical development, including BioMed Valley Discoveries’ ulixertinib (BVD-523), Eli Lilly’s LY-3214996, Merck’s MK-8353, Novartis’ LTT-462, Asana’s ASN-007 and Astex’s ASTX-029. Furthermore, it is possible that other companies are also engaged in discovery or preclinical development of compounds targeting ERK. These competitors, if successful in clinical development, may achieve clinical activity, regulatory approval and market adoption in advance of our compounds, constraining the ability of our compounds to gain significant market share. Although we believe that KO-947 presents several potential advantages relative to these aforementioned candidates, including potency, prolonged pathway inhibition and the ability to be administered as an intravenous infusion, these results may not translate to superior therapeutic benefit in clinical trials.
Menin-MLL Inhibitor Competition
 Although there are currently no approved drugs targeting the menin-MLL interaction, we are aware of other companies engaged in discovery or preclinical development of menin-MLL inhibitors including Syndax and Aurigene/Orion. However, to our kno
wledge, there are no drugs approved or in clinical trials targeting the menin-MLL protein-protein interaction. Although there are no targeted therapies approved specifically for the treatment of MLL-r leukemias, there are several products in clinical development, including Epizyme’s EPZ-5676 and Novartis’s midostaurin. In addition, Pfizer’s palbociclib (IBRANCE®) is also in development and has received accelerated approval in combination with letrozole for the treatment of certain genetically identified postmenopausal women.
 Commercialization
 We have not yet established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure because our lead candidates are still in preclinical or clinical development. We anticipate that we will aim to retain commercial rights in North America for any of our product candidates for which we may in the future receive marketing approvals. We may also seek to retain commercial rights in Europe for any of our product candidates for which we may in the future receive marketing approvals. We currently anticipate that, if and when appropriate, we will seek to access the North American or European oncology markets through a focused, specialized, internal sales force.
 Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused internal sales and marketing team in North America to sell our products. We may also build a focused internal sales and marketing team in Europe to sell our products. We believe that such an approach will enable us to address the community of oncologists who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our current product candidates are being developed. Outside of regions where we maintain commercial rights, we may enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions.
 
14


We also aim to build a marketing and sales management force to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we may in the future market through our own sales teams and to oversee and support our sales force. We anticipate that our goals for any such marketing force include developing educational initiatives with respect to any approved products and establishing relationships with thought leaders in relevant fields of medicine.
 We currently expect that any third parties with which we may collaborate in the future on the development of any commercial companion diagnostics for use with our therapeutic products will most likely hold the commercial rights to those diagnostic products. We expect that we would coordinate closely with any future diagnostic collaborators in connection with the marketing and sale of such diagnostic products and our related therapeutic products.
 Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing as well as for commercial manufacture of any products that we may commercialize. All of our product candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in synthetic processes from available starting materials. The chemistry does not currently require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
 For all our product candidates, we aim to identify and qualify manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and drug product services prior to submission of an NDA to the FDA.
 We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we or our collaborators may develop.
 Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our product candidates and our core technologies, including novel biomarker and diagnostic discoveries and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary or intellectual property rights. We expect that we will seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, licensing or filing our own U.S., international and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position, which we generally seek to protect through contractual obligations with third parties.
 We currently, and expect that we will continue to, file or license patent applications directed to our key product candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions regarding composition-of-matter of these product candidates, as well as biomarkers that may be useful in selecting the right patient population for use of any of our product candidates, formulations, processes and methods of using these product candidates in the treatment of various cancers. We own or in-license a patent portfolio including issued U.S. patents and their respective counterparts in a number of foreign jurisdictions, pending U.S. patent applications, pending applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and corresponding pending patent applications in a number of foreign jurisdictions. We have exclusively licensed from Janssen a portfolio of approximately 20 patent families. The in-licensed Janssen composition-of-matter and method-of-use patents expired in the United States and Europe in 2016. In July 2017 and July 2018, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, issued us patents directed to the method of treatment of HRAS mutant HNSCC with tipifarnib and corresponding patents have been issued in a number of foreign jurisdictions. In May 2018 the U.S. PTO issued us a patent directed to the method of treatment of CXCL12-expressing PTCL or AML, with tipifarnib, and in November 2018 the U.S. PTO issued us a patent directed to the method of treatment of AITL with tipifarnib. We are pursuing additional U.S. and foreign method of treatment patents for tipifarnib. We have also exclusively licensed from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center a patent family pertaining to a method of use of tipifarnib. In addition, the U.S. PTO and the European Patent Office have issued us patents covering the composition of matter of KO-947 and certain structurally related compounds, and methods of using the compounds for the treatment of cancers, and we are pursuing additional U.S. and foreign patents for KO-947. We have exclusively licensed from the University of Michigan or co-own multiple families of patent applications pertaining to our menin-MLL program. The U.S. PTO has issued the University of Michigan and us patents covering the composition of matter of KO-539 and certain structurally related compounds, and methods of using the compounds for the treatment of cancers, and we are pursuing 
 
15


additional U.S. and foreign patents for KO-539. We currently, and expect that we will continue to, file for patents in the United States with counterparts in major market countries in Europe and other key markets in the rest of the world.
 In addition to the patent applications that we have filed to date, we plan to continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio by filing patent applications directed to dosage forms, methods of treatment and additional inhibitor compounds of oncology molecular targets and their derivatives. Specifically, we anticipate that we will seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for novel compositions of matter covering the compounds, the chemistries and processes for manufacturing these compounds, their intermediates and/or metabolites, the use of these compounds in a variety of therapies and the use of biomarkers for patient selection for these compounds. However, these or other patent applications that we may file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents, and any issued patents may cover limited claims that reduce their value and/or may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 In addition to patents, we also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third-party.
 Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
 If the NDA holder for the reference drug and/or patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.
 Non-Patent Exclusivity
 In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of an NDA for a listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon FDA approval of an NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An “active moiety” is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance’s physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug, except that the FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification. Five-year NCE exclusivity does not block the submission, review or approval of a 505(b)(1) NDA.

Patent Term Extension
 After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time between IND application and NDA submission—plus all of the review phase—the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term, including the extension may not exceed 14 years from the date of NDA approval.
 For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. PTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
 Government Regulation
 FDA Approval Process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not placed the IND on hold within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early 
 
17


evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a specific indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter clinical trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second clinical trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial, and the application user fees are typically increased annually.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs to encourage timeliness. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within 12 months from submission; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed within eight months from submission. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an outside advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP—a quality system regulating manufacturing—is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but is not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the 
 
18


original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that the FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Fast Track Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-approval compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4, or post-approval clinical trials, to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-approval studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to priority review by the FDA.
 If a submission is granted Fast Track Designation, the sponsor may engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, and the FDA may review sections of the NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that the FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Breakthrough Therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, the FDA will grant orphan designation for that product for the orphan disease indication, assuming the same drug has not already been approved for the indication for which the sponsor is seeking orphan designation. If the same drug has already been approved for the indication for which the sponsor is seeking orphan designation, the sponsor must present a plausible hypothesis of clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the FDA discloses the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use.
 
19


Orphan designation may provide manufacturers with benefits such as research grants, tax credits, Prescription Drug User Fee Act application fee waivers, and eligibility for orphan drug exclusivity. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval of the active moiety for that disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active ingredient for the same indication, except in limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety or is shown to provide a major contribution to patient care or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan drug has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan drug has exclusivity.
 In the European Union, orphan designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and a grant of ten years of market exclusivity following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 Orphan designation must be requested prior to submission of an application for marketing approval. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the drug’s FDA approved labeling.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-approval testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.

FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 Our drug products may rely upon in vitro companion diagnostics for use in selecting the patients that we believe will respond to our cancer therapeutics. If safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, or IVD, the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. This policy is described in an August 2014 FDA guidance document.
 The FDA has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain a premarket approval, or PMA, for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the drug. We believe that the FDA will require PMA approval of one or more in vitro companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for our cancer therapies. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our cancer treatments involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
 The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
 PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, denial of submissions for new products or withdrawal of PMA approvals.
 Clinical Trials and IDEs
 A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application. In some cases, one or more smaller IDE studies may precede a pivotal clinical trial intended to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the investigational device.
 All clinical studies of investigational devices must be conducted in compliance with the FDA’s requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients pursuant to FDA regulations, the FDA must approve an IDE application prior to initiation of investigational use. IVD trials usually do not require an IDE, as the FDA does not judge them to be a significant risk because the results do not affect the patients in the study. However, for a clinical trial where the IVD 
 
21


result directs the therapeutic care of patients with cancer, we believe that the FDA may consider the investigation to present significant risk and require an IDE application.
 An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The FDA typically grants IDE approval for a specified number of patients. A non-significant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE. Both significant risk and non-significant risk investigational devices require approval from IRBs at the study centers where the device will be used.
 During the clinical trial, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, clinical trial monitoring, reporting and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and record keeping requirements. Prior to granting PMA approval, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of the study and the clinical data supporting the PMA application for compliance with applicable requirements.
 Although the QSR does not fully apply to investigational devices, the QSR requirement for controls on design and development does apply. The sponsor also must manufacture the investigational device in conformity with the quality controls described in the IDE application and any conditions of IDE approval that the FDA may impose with respect to manufacturing.
 Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States.
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing.
 There are also foreign regulations governing the privacy and security of health information and the use of personal information to sell or market products, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or GDPR, which went into effect on May 25, 2018, and which imposes privacy and security obligations on any entity that collects and/or processes health data from individuals located in the European Union and/or sells or markets products in the European Union. Under the GDPR, fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4% of the annual global turnover of the infringer, whichever is greater, could be imposed for significant non-compliance.
 Additional Regulations and Environmental Matters
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, we are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These laws include transparency laws, anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes and regulation regarding providing drug samples, among others.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual or the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
 
22


Federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information used and disclosed by covered entities and their business associates that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. Many states and foreign jurisdictions also have laws and regulations that govern the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, and such laws often vary from one another and from HIPAA.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. It also requires certain manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to track and
 report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures or drug pricing. Certain state and local laws also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Our activities may also subject to be certain state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information that may not be preempted by HIPAA.
 Because of the breadth of these laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant administrative, criminal and civil penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private "qui tam" actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations
 In addition to regulatory schemes that apply, or may in the future apply, to our business, we are or may become subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, laboratory procedures and any use and disposal by us of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research and development activities. We do not presently expect such environmental, health and safety laws or regulations to materially impact our present or planned future activities.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of any of our product candidates that may be approved, including any drug or companion diagnostics we may develop, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the cost of the product will be covered by third-party payors. Third-party payors may limit coverage to an approved list of products, or formulary, which might not include all drug products approved 
 
23


by the FDA for an indication. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party payor reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective by third-party payors, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in the future to demonstrate the medical necessity and/or cost effectiveness of any such product. Nonetheless, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown increased interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Continued interest in and adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the product candidates we are developing.
 Health Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a specific focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. By way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was signed into law, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. Legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, included a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that
 delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to
 repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.

Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner by which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint”, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General, proposed modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. While some of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 In the coming years, additional legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of our product candidates.
