Order Backlog
For information regarding order backlog, refer to the section entitled “Inbound Orders and Order Backlog” in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
All of our business segments purchase carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and/or steel castings and forgings both domestically and internationally. We do not use single source suppliers for the majority of our raw material purchases and believe the available supplies of raw materials are adequate to meet our needs.
Sales and Marketing
We sell and market our products and services predominantly through a direct sales force, supplemented with independent distributors and sales representatives. Our experienced international sales force is comprised of individuals with strong technical expertise in our products and services and the industries in which they are sold.
We support our sales force with marketing and training programs that are designed to increase awareness of our product offerings and highlight our differentiation while providing a set of sales tools to aid in the sales of our technology solutions. We actively employ a broad range of marketing programs to inform and educate customers, the media, industry analysts, and academia through targeted newsletters, our web-site, seminars, trade shows, user groups, and conferences.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We own a number of United States and foreign patents, trademarks, and licenses that are cumulatively important to our business. We own approximately 740 United States and foreign issued patents and have approximately 233 patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. Further, we license certain intellectual property rights to or from third parties. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names and have approximately 815 registrations and pending applications in the United States and abroad. A substantial majority of these patents, trademarks and tradenames are associated with the FoodTech segment. Developing and maintaining a strong intellectual property portfolio is an important component of our strategy to extend our technology leadership. However, we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents, trademarks, or licenses would have a material adverse effect on our overall business.
Competition
We conduct business worldwide and compete with large multinational companies as well as a variety of local and regional companies, which typically are focused on a specific application, technology or geographical area.
We compete by leveraging our industry expertise to provide differentiated and proprietary technology, integrated systems, high product quality and reliability, and comprehensive aftermarket service. We strive to provide our customers with equipment that delivers a lower total cost of ownership, distinguishing ourselves by providing excellent equipment uptime and increased yields with improved final product quality. Our ability to provide comprehensive sales and service in all major regions of the world, by maintaining local personnel direct in region, differentiates us from regional competition.

Working Capital Practices
In order to provide, and install, custom designed equipment, companies in the food machinery industry generally generate customer deposits, or advance payments, before construction begins. For this reason, FoodTech can be less working capital intensive than many other industrial capital goods industries. AeroTech solutions, which are more standardized, do not generate a significant amount of advance payment from the air transportation industry, and therefore is generally more capital intensive.
Employees
We have approximately 5,800 employees with approximately 3,400 located in the United States. Approximately 8% of our employees in the United States are represented by three collective bargaining agreements. 
Outside the United States, we enter into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction. Approximately 55% of our international employees are covered under national employee unions.
We maintain good employee relations and have successfully concluded all of our recent negotiations without a work stoppage. However, we cannot predict the outcome of future contract negotiations.
Customers
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in any of the last three fiscal years.
Government Contracts
AeroTech supplies equipment and logistics support to the U.S. Department of Defense and international forces. The amount of equipment and parts supplied to these programs is dependent upon annual government appropriations and levels of military spending. In addition, United States defense contracts are unilaterally terminable at the option of the United States government with compensation for work completed and costs incurred. Contracts with the United States government and defense contractors are subject to special laws and regulations, the noncompliance with which may result in various sanctions that could materially affect our ongoing government business.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of environmental quality. If we fail to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, administrative, civil, and criminal penalties may be imposed, and we may become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders. We may also be subject to civil claims arising out of an accident or other event causing environmental pollution. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for our own acts even though these actions were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. 
Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as CERCLA, and related state laws and regulations, joint and several liability can be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner and operator of a contaminated site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, including hazardous substances generated by any closed operations or facilities. In addition, neighboring landowners or other third parties may file claims for personal injury, property damage, and recovery of response cost. We may also be subject to the corrective action provisions of the Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and analogous state laws that require owners and operators of facilities that treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste to clean up releases of hazardous waste constituents into the environment associated with their operations.
Many of our facilities and operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to worker health and workplace safety, including the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA. We believe that appropriate precautions are taken to protect our employees and others from harmful exposure to potentially hazardous materials handled and managed at our facilities, and that we operate in substantial compliance with all OSHA or similar regulations.
We are also subject to laws and regulations related to conflict minerals, export compliance, local hiring and anti-corruption, and we have adopted policies, procedures and employee training programs that are designed to facilitate compliance with those laws and regulations.
