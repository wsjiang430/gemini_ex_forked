The Company has multiple lines of business units comprising of our core wearable tech SmartSole line, Military, OEM and professional services, mobile and digital, Near field Communications (NFC) asset tracking and intellectual property licensing. The business units generate various revenue streams, such as product sales, recurring subscriptions, software and intellectual property (IP) licensing, fees for custom hardware and software development, professional consulting, support and maintenance services. Many of our products are protected by GTX’s IP portfolio of close to 90 issued patents, licensed patents, patents pending, registered trademarks, copyrights, URLs and a library of proprietary hardware designs and software.
 
BUSINESS UNITS
 

1) | Our SmartSole line of wearable footwear technology is designed for people with cognitive memory disorders, such as Alzheimer’s, dementia, autism and traumatic brain injury (“TBI”). Currently that number is estimated at 100 million worldwide and expected to reach 277 million by 2050. Typically, these people have a tendency to wander and require some wander guard technology and remote oversight. The SmartSoles are comfortable orthotic insoles embedded with a GPS and cellular tracking module, so that a caregiver can know in real time where a loved one is at the touch of a button from any smartphone or computer. Approximately 9 million people in the US and over 100 million worldwide are affected with some sort of cognitive memory disorder. With recent innovations of new biometric technology sensors we plan to expand beyond location based services and into the general senior population for people that need to track their mobility, activity and balance. Think of this as the FitBit for the senior’s market, with a potential customer base of 72 million people in the US and 650 million worldwide.

2) | Military, OEM and custom development for tracking military personnel, and high value assets, such as drones, small light weight cargo, rifles and other high value mobile assets that require our robust, small footprint and low power consumption hardware platform. 
3) | Mobile and digital for the work force, such as salespersons, journalists, electricians, plumbers, food delivery, property management agents, cleaning services and other industries that require knowing the whereabouts of an employee or contractor in real time but that don’t want to invest in costly GPS devices, instead would rather leverage a user’s smartphone. 
4) | IP licensing. Many of our patents were issued over 10 years ago and have garnered interest within the tech community. GTX is currently engaged in a licensing and monetization campaign. Over 150 companies that could potentially license some or all of our IP, have been identified. 
5) | BLE and NFC technology for tracking people indoors, such as children in schools and valuable assets across the supply chain. BLE - Bluetooth Low Energy and NFC – Near Field Communication are a short-range wireless technology that triggers data exchange from one device to another. The chip is about the size of a nickel and can be attached, embedded, sewn, glued, embroidered and even ironed on or otherwise affixed to just about any person or product, including print materials, packaging and wearables.

CORPORATE STRATEGY
 
Management’s corporate strategy is to continue to build and develop GTX as a technology company that provides turnkey solutions for the consumer, enterprise and government in the field of tracking and monitoring people and high value assets. Most of the GTX product lines are sold with a monthly, quarterly or annual subscription service plan or licensing fees ranging from $2.00 to $35.00 per month per device. In addition to recurring service fees the Company also generates revenues through software and IP licensing, which to date most of our IP licensing agreements have been in the low five figures to the mid six figures. In order to facilitate and sustain long-term growth we are focused on adding new subscribers and signing new licensing agreements so that we can build a steady base of recurring revenues. Product sales and building out our patent portfolio are the key drivers of these initiatives. The more products we develop and sell the more subscribers we bring onboard. And, as our patent portfolio grows and evolves so do our licensing opportunities. To date we have built a network of strategic partners, a robust technology platform of proprietary hardware and software and a growing intellectual property (IP) portfolio. The GTX product lines of embedded smart wearable GPS devices, Stand-Alone GPS devices, Digital Apps, BLE/NFC solution and encrypted RF military personnel and asset tracking solutions are sold both direct to consumer (B2C) and business to business (B2B) and direct to the Military, through our global network of resellers, affiliates, distributors, non-profit organizations, government agencies, police departments, manufacturers reps and retailers. The Company has been ramping up its product distribution and sales channels and, as of December 31, 2018, the Company had live units in the field and / or paying subscribers in over 35 countries, with well-established customers and distributors in Canada, Mexico, Europe, Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. In the U.S. the Company sells direct to the consumer through its online ecommerce platform, a host of retailers and resellers along with over 900 online affiliates. The Company also manages direct B2B enterprise and government sales through its business development team and advisors. The B2B initiatives comprise of supporting existing distributors along with bringing on new distributors, working with U.S. and Foreign Military agencies, to support existing business and secure new business, and domestically to work with local, state and federal agencies in order to acquire reimbursement codes for its line of SmartSoles. To date GTX has been issued a vendor number for reimbursement in 11 U.S. states and internationally in Canada, Norway, Sweden and in the U.K. the National Health Services (NHS) began conducting regional pilots for the wander assistive GPS SmartSoles, in urban centers with high populations of seniors afflicted with dementia. Under these reimbursement programs, the SmartSoles are either partially (50% to 60%) or up to (100% including the monthly subscriptions) are paid for or subsidized by the local, state or federal agencies. We have also applied for grants and private insurance reimbursement along with other health and municipal services in several other countries. Where granted, the subsidies lower the cost of acquiring and owning our tracking products, which can result in an increase in customers and revenues.
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
 
Location-Based Services (LBS) and Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) is projected to grow from USD 22.18 billion in 2018 to USD 68.85 billion by 2023, a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 25.4%. This growth will be fueled because it is now possible for a network of physical objects (humans, vehicles, buildings, infrastructure, equipment of all shapes and types) to collect and exchange data and to communicate and work together. This enables devices, sensors and systems to operate autonomously in pursuit of goals and objectives set by the human architects of the system. While we all move towards an even more connected world, we believe that accurately identifying the location of a person or assets in real time will be a key driver in many applications for the consumer, enterprise and government sectors.
 
Smart wearable technology is becoming ubiquitous and it is starting to find its way into all parts of society. Miniature electronic devices that are worn by a person, commonly referred to as wearables, are continuing on a strong upward trajectory evident by the likes of Nike, Garmin, Google, Samsung, Apple, Verizon and a host of other fortune 100 companies that have entered into this space. Wearable Technology is on the rise in personal fitness, wellness, healthcare and business use. CCS Insight recently updated its outlook on the future of wearable tech, indicating that 411 million smart wearable devices, worth a staggering $34 billion, will be sold in 2020. And according to IDC, which recently reported that the global wearables market grew 31.4 percent during the fourth quarter of 2018, reaching a new high. Moreover, year-end 2018 shipments totaled an impressive 172.2 million units, up 27.5 percent from 135 million shipments in 2017.
 
The Caregiving Innovation Frontiers (CIF) study found that an estimated 117 million Americans will need assistance of some kind by 2020, but the number of unpaid caregivers is only expected to reach 45 million in the same year. We believe that these unpaid caregivers would benefit from solutions, such as our flagship GPS SmartSoles that can assist them in locating and monitoring their elderly persons. This huge demand represents a $279 billion revenue opportunity over the next four years across six different business areas identified in the study, with 80% of spending being out-of-pocket costs. Technology solutions and remote health monitoring systems that enable family caregivers to monitor the location of elderly persons could provide key relief, according to the report. The CIF report outlined six areas for business opportunities, with huge potential for revenue grabs. Technology represents an opportunity across all the service areas, according to AARP. The majority of family caregivers—67% of them—want to use technology to monitor their loved one’s health and safety, but only about 10% are doing so right now, leaving a lot of room for growth.

In our ever-mobile society, it helps to know where we are and where we are going. Same with caregivers of seniors suffering from Alzheimer’s and dementia, freight forwarding companies wanting to know where their packages are, and employers wanting to know where their field workers are. Many parents desire to have the ability to know where their children are and where they are going. Having such information is now possible with access to real-time information delivered on-demand through miniaturized, low power consumption locator systems and technologies such as ours.
 
The rising need for real-time location systems (RTLS) and wearable location based services (LBS) is influenced by several factors, among them:
 

● | Universal awareness and expanding penetration of GPS enabled mobile smartphones & tablets (estimated 2 billion). 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Personal and asset security concerns affecting a greater portion of the population. This includes the increased awareness related to global terrorism, active shootings, natural disasters and general unrest. 
● | Increasing numbers of elderly or memory impaired (Alzheimer’s, dementia, autism, etc. 9 million in U.S. and growing to 277 million worldwide by 2050). 
● | Corporations needing to manage worker productivity, efficiency and logistics. 
● | Government agencies, law enforcement and military need to track personnel and asset monitoring. 
● | Massive life style adoption of Location Based Advertising and Social Networking. 

 
Management believes that more and more consumers, enterprises and government agencies are realizing the importance of using tracking and monitoring information technology. The technology growth story has long focused on the consumer, but as enterprises in every industry sector, including the government sector, look to technology to facilitate and transform their own operations, the opportunities for technology companies have broadened considerably. The following information illustrates the ways in which various tech markets are expected to grow.
 
The indoor location market is estimated to grow from $7.1 billion in 2017 to $40.2 billion by 2022, at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR of 42%. (Source: http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/indoor-location.asp).
 
The location-based services (“LBS”) and real-time location systems (“RTLS”) market has grown considerably over the past few years and is expected to grow further with increasing portable personal digital assistant (“PDA”)-based e-commerce. The overall market is expected to grow from $15.04 billion in 2016 to $77.84 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 38.9%.
 
In July 2013, Cisco forecasted that The Internet of Things, which consists of smart connected objects in homes, businesses and our surroundings that have the ability communicate over a multimodal network without human-to-human or human-to-computer involvement, would grow to 50 billion devices by the year 2020.
 
The U.S. Federal IT market will reach $140 billion by 2023, growing at CAGR 3.6% in the period 2018-2023 according to Market Research Media (Source: https://www.marketresearchmedia.com/?p=193).

CUSTOMERS
 
The company along with its international distributors service thousands of consumers, hundreds of businesses, and dozens of local, state and federal government agencies, across 35 countries. GTX also sells products and services to the U.S. Military and law enforcement agencies and is an approved government contractor. Other GTX customers include public health authorities, municipalities and Universities, in the U.S., Canada and across Europe. GTX also has a vendor number in 11 U.S. States and sells to local and state agencies supported by Medicare and Medicaid. Other customers range from retailers, healthcare facilities, private schools, assisted living facilities, NGOs, small business enterprises, senior care homes, and security companies. The Company also has several branded products and sells direct to the consumer.
INTELECTUAL PROPERTY
 
The early investment in IP, going back to 2002, demonstrates GTX’s commitment to developing innovative technology in the growing wearable GPS, LBS and RTLS space. The GTX Intellectual Property (IP) portfolio underpins its business and provides support across all of its business units. The portfolio addresses three core areas: Footwear, Communication and Backend Server Processes and as of 12-31-18 we had twenty-five (25) patents and/or pending applications and several trademark registrations. These include fifteen (15) issued U.S. utility patents, two (2) issued U.S. design patents, and three (3) other pending U.S. utility patent applications. We also have three (3) issued foreign national patents which include one (1) Canadian utility patent and two (2) Mexican utility patents. In addition to the five (5) comm protocol 286 family of patents, GTX also has several patents on the device side and server side. The three (3) pronged IP protection approach (device, communication and server) is part of the overall intellectual property strategy protecting all aspects of the GTX enterprise and value of its hardware and platform.
 
We also have one (1) pending European foreign national patent application based on our U.S. filings. In addition, we have under license thirty-three (33) U.S. patents and twenty-seven (27) foreign patents. Included under the IP portfolio GTX has U.S. trademark registrations including, but not limited to, registrations for the marks “LOCi” and “LOCIMOBILE.” In addition, another U.S. trademark application for “GPS SMART SOLE SATELLITE MONITORING AND REALTIME TRACKING”, “GTX CORP”, and “WITH YOU”.
 
In order to monetize our IP, in June 2016, we signed a revenue share monetization agreement with Inventergy Innovations, LLC (“Inventergy”), a subsidiary of Inventergy Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: INVT). The LLC engaged a highly experienced IP litigation law firm, Cotman IP Law Group in order to support our outbound IP monetization and licensing efforts. Since our portfolio extends beyond our core footwear patents and into areas such as GPS watches, fitness wearables that track location, hand-held GPS devices, tracking apps on Smartphones, standalone GPS tracking devices and location based platforms in general, which represents a very sizable addressable market and due to the large size and scope of this market, the process of identifying potential licensee’s, formulating a strategy and the negotiations or litigation required a lot of time and resources, hence why we brought in a partner. Significant progress was made throughout 2018, our strategy was solidified and implemented, over 100 companies have been identified, contacted or served with lawsuits, and we expect to sign at least 4 or 5 licenses in the first half of 2019 and possibly more throughout the rest of 2019. This is a slow process and as with most legal negotiations does not come with any assurances of success, however we have an excellent legal team and solid strategy in place. Due to the confidentiality nature of these negotiations and legal proceedings both current and in the future, the LLC or GTX are limited in making public announcements and usually bound to confidentiality agreements. We will however be disclosing whatever information we can in our 10Q’s beginning in Q1 2019. Furthering our current IP monetization strategy, GTX is also exploring licensing some of its other patents that are not part of the Invenergy LLC agreement. This is still in an early phase with only a few exploratory conversations that have taken place so far.

YEAR IN REVIEW
 
Kicking off 2018, the Company’s GPS SmartSoles appeared on the popular television show keeping up with the Kardashians, which has been a staple for the E! Network for over a decade, drawing in millions of viewers every show. This episode featured Kris Jenner, in a bid to keep tabs on the whereabouts of her mother, MJ, and gave her a new pair of shoes and insoles, which happen to be GTX’s flagship product. This was a significant boost for our brand and helped pave the way for the launch of a smaller, lower cost hardware platform that is used in our SmartSole line and OEM business. Our production costs dropped by approximately 65% which in turn enabled us to lower our wholesale pricing, allowing for bigger margins for our distributors which helped them generate more business. The new hardware enabled us to come out with a size small SmartSole which opened up new markets and the new hardware platform was also used in our new Invisabelt Tracker, designed for young children and toddlers, which we launched in June 2018 in the U.S only. So far Invisabelt sales have been small, but we expect to introduce the product to our international distributors in 2019 which should increase our numbers. In addition, the new electronics had several new firmware features such as Air Travel Mode, Speed Mode, a larger battery and rapid charging. All of which contributed to more orders, especially in Europe where we have several large distributors. As with all new technology also comes temporary setbacks and after product being out in the field for a few months, we experienced some firmware issues which caused us to stop production in the fourth quarter of 2018. Most of the issues have been resolved and production is back up and running, however we were not able to ship as much of this new hardware platform as we had planned and fulfil all of our orders in the 4th quarter. We notified all of our customers and distributors and besides a temporary setback in some product delivery, which will be made up in the future, no business was lost only delayed in recognizing the revenue.
 
During 2018, the Company continued expanding its B2B sales channels internationally and domestically, signed up new distributors, began new pilot programs, tested and launched new products, explored new business opportunities, and further advanced its work with George Mason University under their grant program. Through our existing partnerships we also attended several large trade shows in the U.S. and Europe and added additional account representatives to manage our reseller programs. In Europe our SmartSole business partners had a few significant breakthroughs. In the U.K. their National Health Services (NHS) began undergoing pilot programs of our GPS SmartSoles in Dorset, England and as of 12-31-18 the NHS was conducting tests in five municipalities. There are close to 850,000 people in the U.K. that have some sort of dementia and according to several British news agency’s once the NHS completes its trials, expected in 2019, they have secured close to $4 million dollars for this program and if successful they plan to roll it out country wide. Another breakthrough was in Norway, our distributor SafeCall was awarded a coveted 2-year contract to supply the municipality of Oslo, Norway with wearable GPS devices along with a 24/7 cloud service center to assist in remote monitoring and look after people with cognitive disabilities. The Norwegian Government identified two target groups which will receive the fully subsidized solution, first, elderly people with dementia and cognitive impairment who still live independently, and children or adolescents with disabilities, especially who are the most “at risk” and therefore would benefit from using wearable GPS technology. Our distributors in Sweden, Germany and Denmark are also reporting significant progress with local and federal agencies and we expect to see an increase in SmartSole sales and subscription activations from these countries in 2019.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we also brought on a new distributor in Canada, Red Dot based in Ottawa and in the U.S. we began selling our GPS SmartSoles and Take-Along Trackers through Seniors.com located in Orange County, CA. Senior.com is the foremost internet resource exclusively focused on empowering its senior community, of over 1.7 million, and is a one-stop-shop for seniors and their families, with over 150,000 products for sale.
 
Domestically throughout 2018 we continued to add more government disability assistance agencies and Police Departments. We are now across 11 States, which have implemented programs that can order SmartSoles and provide full reimbursement for the families for both the product and the recurring service charges. We also went to Capitol Hill and had meetings with Rep. Mike Doyle (D-PA), Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), Sen. Klobuchar (D-MN), Sen. Grassley (R-IA) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to discuss Kevin and Avonte’s Law – S. 2070 which will authorize the appropriation of $2 million annually over the 2018–2022 period for DOJ to make grants to state and local governments and nonprofit organizations to support programs and GPS tracking technology to locate missing persons with dementia or developmental disabilities. We also were invited to attend a conference hosted by the Department of Commerce and the United Nations for a select group of companies to discuss how to do business with the U.N. This is a slow process due to being government agencies, however we made steady progress throughout 2018 and now have in several of the 11 States, more than one agency, department or field office per State buying from us, which means we are penetrating both horizontally across more States and agencies, while also penetrating vertically, deeper within multiple departments within each State.

In September of 2017 we received our first military contract to supply a Personnel and Equipment GPS Tracking system (P.E.T.S.) to Edwards Air Force Base. All of the hardware, software and firmware was designed, manufactured and coded by the Company at its headquarters in Los Angeles, California and proudly displays a Made in U.S.A. logo. GTX also designed the PCB boards in house in order to keep tight control of the entire design and manufacturing processes. This highly versatile and scalable military-grade tagging, tracking & locating (“TTL”) GPS platform was specifically developed by GTX for large-scale installations and military bases that need to monitor the location and movement of both human and non-human assets, but, due to their remote locations or lack of conventional cellular coverage, require devices that can transmit data with a range of 20 miles through RF technology, report latitude and longitude coordinates every second, and encrypt the data for security. The Company’s proprietary GPS transmitters, which are about the size of a garage door opener, are enclosed in military-grade, water-resistant encasements and weigh less than 8 ounces. They can operate on a battery charge for up to 8 hours or be plugged into a vehicle and connect to an axillary antenna for greater range. The system also consists of repeaters that are either PoE (“Power over Ethernet”) or for very remote installations can be equipped with 12-volt batteries and solar panels to achieve months of battery life. The third part of the system are base station receivers that collect the encrypted data either direct from the transmitters or from the repeaters and then output for display.
 
Throughout 2018 GTX successfully delivered multiple orders to Edwards Air Force base and was under contract to provide additional replacement parts and equipment along with support and maintenance service which is expected to continue in 2019. In February of 2018, we began speaking to and conducted an onsite visit, in order to evaluate and asses the needs of another Air Force base located in Utah. We are now in pre contract stage with that base and in conversation with other military bases in California and Nevada to assess and explore their needs and requirements for tracking personnel and mobile assets on their bases. The U.S. Government business is intensely complex, competitive, unpredictable and subject to rapid change. We compete with a large number of diverse companies attempting to enter or expand their presence in the U.S. Government market. This landscape creates a challenging environment for GTX, however we believe that due to the innovative functionality of our products, our many years of experience in GPS real time tracking systems and our IP, we should be able to somewhat successfully compete, and we expect to see continued more military activity throughout 2019. Even though at this time we do not represent a significant presence in this market, it is a market sector that we are actively pursuing and as a result of having been awarded several military contracts and being an approved U.S. military contractor, we have begun dialogue with Military branches from three foreign countries. The process is slow and there is a tremendous amount of bureaucracy to get through along with language and cultural barriars, but we are starting to make progress, have received U.S. clearance to engage with these foreign governments and expect to be presenting them formal proposals in 2019.
 
In August 2018, we formulated a strategic alliance with KGH, Inc and brought Dr. Kathleen Kiernan as an advisor in order to help us build out and grow our government and military business. We also hired a new engineer and additional equipment and tools have been purchased in order to support the in-house manufacturing process required to make the military equipment. In preparation for conducting anticipated future business with the U.S. military, GTX has renewed and updated its System for Award Management (“SAM”) and General Services Administration (“GSA”) entity registrations and has begun conversations with retired military personnel, for joining our advisory board.
 
In August of 2017 the Company signed a collaboration agreement with Veristride, Inc., a company that specializes in gait movement and analysis using custom sensors at the foot and biomechanical analytics to provide feedback on how people walk, run and move. In August of 2018 we put our collaboration with Veristride on hold due to some intellectual property conflicts and their need to divert resources from R&D to sales and marketing. GTX management still strongly believes in this project and market and subsequently in September of 2018 signed an M.O.U with Kinesis Health Technologies LTD to explore the integration of their technology inside the GTX SmartSole footwear platform along with the reselling and marketing of their Gait technology throughout the U.S territory. As mass numbers of Baby Boomers who need care begin to outnumber those able to help them, the need for telematics biometric solutions with the primary goal of monitoring activity, mobility, balance and gait in order to analyze overall health and wellness along with being able to detect fall risk, which is a major cost and lifestyle problem for seniors, continues to be at the forefront of large conversation about the future of healthcare. An estimated 2.8 million older people are treated in emergency departments for fall injuries each year. These fall injuries result in an estimated $31 billion in direct medical costs annually on an inflation-adjusted basis. The business value of analyzing walking patterns through gait technology is significant in fall risk detection and prediction. Despite extensive preventive efforts, falling continues to be a major problem for seniors both at home and in community living facilities. Being able to accurately predict falls, strokes or early onset of dementia by wearing a smart non-intrusive footwear device can offer significant advancements in senior care and wellness making this a high priority development and go to market initiative for the Company.

As the trend to use technological innovations to help seniors live longer and more fulfilling lives, continues to grow around the world (generally referred to as the Aging 2.0 movement), we continue to forge new strategic alliances that will help us grow into the future. One such partner, George Mason University’s College of Health and Human Services successfully completed its Phase II machine learning wandering prediction research utilizing the GTX SmartSoles, IoT platform and data, and a two-stage spatiotemporal clustering algorithm which correctly predicted a users’ location 87% of the time. As part of a the GTX collaboration agreement with Mason, which began in fall of 2016, the University studied wandering habits in elderly people with Alzheimer’s and dementia, and used data from a sample of 338 GPS trackers used during the trial. The research and results will be made available to GTX, which will explore deploying the prediction algorithms into its backend monitoring platform, adding another layer of technology, IP and overall value to its wander assistive GPS tracking products and services.


On April 18, 2018, 1,000,000 preferred shares of the Companies 10,000,000 million authorized preferred shares were assigned a class and issued to the Board of Directors. This class of preferred shares only have voting rights which equal to two-thirds of all the issued and outstanding shares of common stock and shall be entitled to vote on all matters of the corporation. The preferred shares lack any dividend rights, do not have liquidation preference, and are not convertible into common stock. Further these shares require a holding period for vesting and may not be sold or transferred. The Company retained a third-party valuation firm whose input was utilized in determining the related per share valuation of the preferred shares. Based on the valuation report, the fair value of the preferred shares was determined to be $0.0463 per share or an aggregate of $46,363. This was done for accounting and disclosure purposes; however these shares have no market value and are non-liquid. The Company also elected to change its Articles of Incorporation in order to amend the par value for all of its’ authorized shares of common stock from $0.001 to $0.0001. The Company believed a change in par value would not have an adverse impact on the Company and could assisted the Company in future capital raising efforts.
 
On June 22, 2018 as part of the plan to up-list to the OTCQB Venture Exchange as well as realize a more attractive share price, the Company effected a reverse split (the “Reverse Split”) of its outstanding common stock, par value $0.0001, at a ratio of 1-for-75, for the purpose of complying with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Aa. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every seventy-five shares of issued and outstanding Common Stock were automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of Common Stock, without any change in the par value per share. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Split was part of a corporate initiative in order to enhance its public profile and qualify for an up list to the OTCQB.
 
On October 31, 2018 the Company received approval to be up listed to the OTCQB Venture Market and GTXO shares began to trade on the OTCQB Venture Market. To qualify GTX had to be current in their reporting and undergo an annual verification and management certification process and maintain a share price of over $.01. Investors are now be able to find Real-Time quotes and market information for the Company on www.otcmarkets.com. In October 2018 the Company also created a long term employment retention bonus plan and issued 39,500,000 restricted common shares. The shares have a 3-year vesting period and were only issued to eligible, employees, directors and advisors who must have been with the Company for at least 7 years, then need to stay with the company an additional 2 years in order to participate in the plan, and a final year in order to reach the full 3-year vesting period. The Company can buy back the shares at par, from anyone that stops working for the company, prior to their vesting period.

TECHNOLOGY
 
GTX has developed a “carrier-class” architecture and hosts the servers in a facility Data Center (reliable to 99.999%). The local service center runs on redundant off-the-shelf servers. This enables cost-efficient expansion, without the need for application code changes.
 
Our current location tracking product design utilizes quad-band GSM/GPRS telephony chip sets and can be adapted to the prevalent wireless technologies, 2G, 3G or 4G. Our module’s GPS electronics, utilizing advanced “weak signal server-enhanced” technology will provide rapid location identification. Each module is programmed with a unique identification number and uses standard cellular frequencies to communicate its location. The module is also programmed with a unique subscriber identification number allowing each owner to subscribe to different services.
 
We continue to modify and upgrade our modules for our SmartSoles and other GPS tracking product to, among other things, make it available for use in various localities without customization. The production and roll-out of version 1.5 and 2.0 of our SmartSole product is expected to be a benefit because, unlike the earlier versions, we no longer have to custom make SmartSoles for our international distributors with their Sim cards, so our manufacturing cost and time lines are reduced, and we have more flexibility to timely meet our customers’ requirements. Also, we now are able to bill for data charges in over 100 countries, thereby increasing our potential markets. The ability to both produce a product that is able to be delivered to foreign market without customization and to bill for data charges in additional countries will enable us to increase our RPS (revenue per subscriber). Our core tracking products (SmartSole, Take-Along-Tracker, OEM modules and Track my Work Force App) are supported by the existing infrastructure for the worldwide cell network that provides coverage throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and numerous other countries that operate on the global GSM Wireless networks. Our personal locator modules have the ability to operate on the networks of 290 carriers in over 210 countries.
 
STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS and LICENSING
 
We offer location based hardware and/or IoT data monitoring platform to third parties for the sale and distribution of location based products/services in various vertical markets. We begin the process by entering into a platform test agreement or pilot program with a potential partner with the intent to transition into a long-term relationship. By establishing and building partnerships, through licensing agreements, OEM, and carrier relationships, we facilitate efficient entry into new markets leveraging each third parties core competencies. We enhance the value of our distribution channels by aligning our sales and marketing efforts with strategic partners, including co-branding, distribution and marketing with telecommunication companies, wireless carriers, national retailers and major consumer branded companies. We have the ability to customize our products into different form factors for the specific needs of customers. To date, the Company has created custom solutions for the monitoring of seniors with cognitive memory disorders by installing the GPS device into specially designed shoes and insoles; the monitoring of children by installing the GPS device into specially designed toys, belts, insoles and backpacks; and the monitoring of various high value assets such as drones, long guns and other mobile assets.
 
The Company has several key strategic relationships established both on the supply side and the distribution side. Some of the key partners on the supply side are Atlantic Footcare, which manufactures our SmartSoles, Telic and Mobilogix which manufactures our GPS and Cellular electronics, and Telefonica which provides our global connectivity. On the distribution side, we have numerous partnerships worldwide, ranging from distributors, health organizations, and retailers.
 
The Company continues to engage in new pilot programs domestically and internationally with these pilot programs being conducted by assisted living facilities, Government and Municipal agencies, Police departments, health organizations, retailers, distributors, universities; non-profits, special needs schools and independent sales organizations. The pilot programs generally last 2 to 4 months with a constant rotation of some pilots converting to commercial rollouts and new pilots coming in.

RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT
 
As an emerging tech company our long term growth is predicated on making investments in R&D. Throughout 2018 we did not spend as much as we would have liked on R&D but we did manage to commercially launch new products, such as the Invisabelt, and Pet tracker, make prototypes of the Rifle Tracker, and soft launch our NFC asset tracker. We also continued development into our military product line, BioStride and indoor BLE tracking. Our future plans, as profits and cash flow increases, do include more investments in research and development and related product opportunities. Management believes that we must continue to dedicate a proportional amount of resources to R&D efforts to maintain a long term competitive position.
GROWTH STRATEGY
 
To date it has been a slow building process but the foundation has been laid. We have developed a multi-prong business model approach; business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C), Government and Military sales, and licensing of our technology and IP. We have successfully proven out all our models in a small scale. With B2C, once we can hit critical mass with lower pricing we will expand into the mass consumer markets. With B2B our strategy is to establish more partners and relationships with key industry leaders who will embed our technology into their products to sell to their established customer base. In addition, we plan to continue working with the Military both in the U.S. and abroad. Lastly, we plan to continue to identify companies that can license our IP. This approach requires time and capital to grow, however it is also diversified so that all of our eggs are not in one basket and once scaled can show rapid growth. As a small and underfinanced company, we have still managed to prove out these 4 models, they are all in play, we sell products everyday B2C, we have over a dozen distributors across the world, we have delivered several orders to the U.S. military and we have collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from IP licensing so far. Management believes that once we have the resources to scale any of these models or all of them we can expect to see steady and sustainable growth.
 
Key elements of our growth strategy include:
 

● | Providing our Personal Locator hardware module to licensees to empower their products with our two-way GPS tracking capabilities; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | OEM private label manufacturing; 
● | A mass market retail price under $99.00 for Personal Location devices; 
● | A monthly service fee structure, under $20.00; 
● | Reduction in hardware size and cost in order to open new markets; 
● | Continue expanding our medical reimbursement programs; 
● | Rolling out bio metrics and NFC; 
● | Expanding distribution channels; 
● | Increasing the number of solutions for the military and law enforcement markets; 
● | Ease of use at the location interface point as well as with the device, using state-of-the-art cloud computing and cloud application development and; 
● | Expanding our IP monetization campaign. 

COMPETITION
 
Personal location and asset tracking devices of various kinds are currently available from numerous vendors, and the number of competitive products is increasing rapidly in the marketplace. Furthermore, many of the location products and services are available at no cost to the user or are already included in other products. Nevertheless, we believe this rapidly growing market acceptance of the tracking solutions that we offer represents an opportunity as the intrinsic value of the tracking solutions is recognized and mass market adoption continues. The key competitive advantage for GTX in its lead SmartSole product is our innovative approach to embedding electronics inside a flexible footwear system, which advantage is protected by an extensive patent portfolio and first to market. Another key competitive advantage is our large and growing patent portfolio along with our ability, because we are a small company, to be agile and responsive while still having deep and long industry knowledge of the GPS space.

There are numerous competitors for GPS products in general, and for our LOCiMOBILE® smart phone applications in particular, including Location Based Technologies, Inc., Google Latitude, Foursquare, Trimble Navigation, Inc., Brick House Security, Verizon, and Trackimo, Inc. Many of our competitors are better financed than we are and/or have greater marketing and scientific resources than we can provide. We are also aware of a number of domestic and foreign competitors that offer much lower quality products in order to gain market share. The U.S. Government systems integration business is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change due to new requirements and budget allocation. We compete with a large number of military suppliers and other large and diverse companies attempting to enter or expand their presence in the U.S. Government market. Many of the existing and potential competitors have greater financial, operating and technological resources than we have. The competitive environment may require us to make changes in our pricing, services or marketing. The competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks, including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us, or that may be awarded, but for which we do not receive meaningful revenues. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to develop services and products that address changing needs and to provide people and technology needed to deliver these services and products. In the government services sector our competition includes large systems integrators and defense contractors. Some of these competitors include global defense and IT service companies such as, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon. However so far being small and nibble along with our ability to deliver product and services, quickly, at a fair market price and customize products on demand, have been to our advantage, over many larger competitors.
