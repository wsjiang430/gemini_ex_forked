The EcoSmart Platform provides comprehensive energy and operational savings, management monitoring, reporting, analytics of a property or individual room by adding intelligence to HVAC runtimes and through integrations with door locks, lighting, window coverings, and more end-user attributes. Telkonet has deployed more than 600,000 intelligent devices worldwide in properties and buildings within the hospitality, military, educational, healthcare and other commercial markets. The EcoSmart Platform is rapidly becoming a leading solution for reducing energy consumption, operational costs and carbon footprints, and eliminating the need for new energy generation in these markets – all while engaging and delighting guests.
 
Controlling energy consumption can make a significant impact on a building’s bottom line, as HVAC costs represent a substantial portion of a facility’s overall utility bill. Hospitality is a key market for Telkonet. According to the EPA EnergySTAR Portfolio Manager 2015 analysis, the median hotel uses approximately 187 kBtu/ft2 from all energy sources.[1] On average, America’s approximately 47,000 hotels spend $2,196 per available room each year on energy, representing 3% - 6% of all operating costs and 60% of carbon emissions[2]. Telkonet approaches the opportunity to reduce consumed energy by adding intelligence to a property’s HVAC and lighting systems.
 
Energy is often wasted through the lighting, powering, heating and cooling of unoccupied spaces. These spaces with intermittent occupancy constitute Telkonet’s target markets, and our experience, supported by independent research and customer data, suggests these rooms are unoccupied as much as 70% of the time.
 
EcoSmart Product Suite
 

· | EcoTouch Thermostat: As one of the newest additions to Telkonet’s suite of hardware, the EcoTouch is an all touch capacitive thermostat interface available in wired and wireless models offering a premium aesthetic. The EcoTouch allows building owners to match the thermostat with the design of their room by changing the color of the outer edge and by selecting between black or white options. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | EcoInsight Thermostat: A programmable and controllable wired thermostat with over 125 configurable settings used to control the efficiency of HVAC through the use of environment variables and triggers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | EcoAir Thermostat: A wireless thermostat mirroring the EcoInsight footprint while enabling the relocation of in room controls without the usual construction expense and downtime. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | EcoSource Controller: The remote HVAC control device associated with Telkonet’s thermostat interfaces allowing control while removing the need for expensive rewiring and construction. The EcoSource may also be used for third-party integrations, monitoring and control scenarios. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | EcoSmart VRF Controller: The newest product in the EcoSmart Suite, the VRF Controller works with most of the new variable refrigerant systems coming to market. The devices replace the EcoSource where discrete relays are not available. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All sensors are programmed to ensure accurate occupancy detection. The EcoSense Occupancy Sensor may be hardwired or programmed to communicate wirelessly and may be battery operated or utilize external power. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | EcoSwitch Light Switch: An EcoSmart energy management product with the appearance of a traditional ‘rocker’ light switch. Turning lights off, even for a short time, saves energy and extends lamp life. The EcoSwitch can be used to compose and automate dramatic lighting scenes in a room. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | EcoGuard Outlet: An EcoSmart control that acts as the replacement for an in-wall outlet and has the ability to monitor and control the flow of power to one or both outlets. Based on occupancy, it can turn off lamps, televisions, appliances, and any other energy-consuming loads that are plugged in, preventing a property from consuming power in an empty room. The EcoGuard completely disconnects devices from the power supply, preventing lights and other in-room electronics from needlessly consuming energy as well as providing monitoring of energy flow and efficiency when a plug is enabled. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | EcoContact Door & Window Sensor: A remote, wireless door/window contact with the ability to provide additional occupancy data and control HVAC operability and other consumption measures when doors or windows are open.

Several of these devices have been recently released in “Plus” models which provide greater functionality and increased capabilities.
 
EcoCentral
 
Telkonet’s EcoSmart Platform is a comprehensive solution for intelligent automation and energy management. The platform has a well-developed upgrade path with the final and complete version of the platform offering real-time control and analytics provided through a cloud computing platform called EcoCentral. EcoCentral derives its name through its ability to direct user resources to where they add the most value. From monitoring equipment operation and determining where engineering efforts are needed and notifying staff when performance is degrading, EcoCentral creates a comprehensive tool for providing insights and access for EcoSmart Platform deployments either individually or across an entire building portfolio.
 
EcoCare
 
EcoCare is Telkonet’s professional support services including call, email and chat support, repair and replacement services, periodic reporting, communication with customers’ utility and Internet Service Provider (“ISP”) partners and more. Telkonet provides three packages of EcoCare services as well as allows customers to create their own package of services ala carte. EcoCare allows EcoSmart customers to ensure that they continue to recognize the savings estimated and benefit from the intended return on investment (ROI). Typical EcoCare contracts range from one to five years and have automatic renewal terms built into each individual contract. All support staff are located at Telkonet’s Waukesha, Wisconsin headquarters.
 
EcoSmart Mobile
 
Telkonet’s EcoMobile tools provide iOS and Android applications for use by partners, customers, end users or guests. These mobile tools extend the value of the EcoSmart Platform and give greater functionality and more efficient commissioning and deployment abilities to the user. We have identified where, by providing more accessibility, we can create additional charged-for services that increase customer savings, improve guest experience and integrate more fully with customer environments to create a tight relationship with our customers.
 
Intelligent Energy Management
 
Telkonet’s EcoSmart energy management platform applies and improves building intelligence to deliver energy and cost savings through controlling lighting, plugload and HVAC runtimes. Captured data may be presented on a grouped, property or room-by-room basis, allowing very granular management of in-room energy use and environmental conditions. EcoSmart achieves this by leveraging our device platform, including occupancy sensors and intelligent programmable thermostats connected with packaged terminal air conditioner (“PTAC”) controllers or any other terminal equipment HVAC products and managed wireless light switches and in wall electrical plugs to adjust and maintain energy consumption including a room’s temperature according to occupancy, eliminating wasteful heating and cooling of unoccupied rooms. All of these can be accomplished from the in-room devices or via any web-connected device, such as smart phones, tablets and laptop computers.
 
EcoSmart is an energy management platform that delivers optimal, individual room energy savings without compromising occupant comfort, due to a proprietary technology named “Recovery Time”.
 
Recovery Time Technology
 
EcoSmart’s HVAC controls feature Recovery Time, technology designed to maximize energy efficiency without sacrificing occupant comfort. When a room is occupied, the temperature selected by the occupant will be maintained by the EcoSmart system. Once an EcoSmart occupancy sensor determines that the room is unoccupied, the system adjusts the room temperature using Recovery Time. Unlike other systems, Recovery Time technology constantly performs calculations that evaluate how far each individual room’s temperature can drift from the occupant’s preferred setting (“set-point”), to harvest energy savings while still being able to return to the occupant’s set-point within a customer’s pre-defined period of time.

3
-

 

When determining the temperature setting, Recovery Time technology considers how long it will take to return the temperature to the occupant’s set-point once they return to their room. The temperature will only drift far enough to ensure the system will return to the occupant’s preferred temperature setting within minutes upon their return to the room. The specific length of recovery time is selected by property management at the time of the installation; however, it can be altered at any time by management.
 
How Do Other Systems Work?
 
In competing systems the occupant chooses their preferred temperature. When the occupant leaves, the thermostat reverts to a set-point of a fixed number of degrees different than the preferred set temperature (lower in winter and higher in summer). In some products temperature gap is a fixed temperature selected by the property owner. Because each occupant room will require different lengths of time to return to the occupant’s desired temperature, based on room size and orientation, whether blinds are open, outdoor temperature, sun, and wind, the length of time required for the HVAC to return to temperature can vary dramatically and can often be prohibitive. Additionally, a dirty HVAC filter or coil will reduce heat transfer, increasing that recovery time.
 
EcoSmart Delivers Room-by-Room Savings
 
Because each room’s environment is unique, Telkonet’s approach is likewise unique. Rooms are evaluated independently in real-time to determine its energy efficient temperature, or setback. Recovery Time technology constantly calculates in real-time how far the room temperature can drift, by taking into consideration the environmental characteristics that impact the temperature in the room, including:
 

· | The occupant’s preferred temperature setting
--+---------------------------------------------


· | The location of the room within the building
--+---------------------------------------------


· | The window placement – facing the sun or shade 
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | If the drapes are open or closed
--+---------------------------------


· | If the climate is dry or humid
--+-------------------------------


· | The varying weather conditions throughout the day 
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | The condition of the HVAC unit, such as age and efficiency 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 
Through the constant monitoring of the HVAC unit’s ability to drive the temperature and the real-time adjustment of the setback temperature, rooms are never excessively hot or cold when an occupant returns to the room. The room will always be just minutes away from an occupant’s desired comfort setting. As a result, Recovery Time technology delivers room-by-room, occupant-by-occupant savings. The technology also significantly improves the guest experience, driving loyalty to the property and brand, and decreases service calls.
 
The EcoSmart Platform maximizes energy reductions while at the same time ensuring occupant comfort, maximizing energy savings and extending equipment life expectancy. The technology is particularly attractive to customers in the hospitality industry, as well as the education, healthcare, public housing and government/military markets, who are constantly seeking ways to reduce costs and meet federal and state mandates without impacting building occupant comfort.

Using standard communication protocols, ensuring widespread adoption and a simple interface, EcoSmart technology may also be integrated with utility controls, property management systems and building automation systems to be used in load shedding initiatives. This feature provides management companies and utilities enhanced opportunities for cost savings, environmental protections and energy management. Additionally, Telkonet’s energy management systems qualify for most state and federal energy efficiency and rebate programs.

Our open, scalable and standards-based architecture approach allows for truly custom deployments. The EcoSmart Platform integrates seamlessly with back-office management systems, property management systems, building automation systems, and utility demand/response programs, as well as additional third-party network architecture to recognize increased efficiency and savings.
 
Based on these platform features and capabilities, we’ve been awarded, and continue to receive, contracts in the hospitality, military, educational, multiple dwelling unit (“MDU”), healthcare and commercial industries. In addition, our relationships with utility-sponsored direct-install and rebate-funded programs provide us with a significant advantage over our competitors in the commercial space.
 
Given the population growth in the United States and the increasing demand for energy, we forecast additional energy-related infrastructure will be needed. We believe the use of Smart Grid technologies and energy efficiency management platforms are affordable alternatives to building additional power generation through leveraging existing resources and providing enhanced energy savings costs.
 
Target Markets
 
Rooms with intermittent occupancy are most commonly found in the following market sectors:
 

· | Hospitality: hotels, motels, resorts, timeshares and casinos. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Educational: residence halls, dormitories and other campus living options. Also K-12 environments with distributed and portable classrooms. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Military: residence halls, barracks, apartments and other campus living options. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Health care: medical office buildings, assisted and independent living facilities.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------

Industry and Market Overview
 
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, 44% of all the energy consumed by commercial buildings in the United States is employed to cool, heat, or light, within commercial buildings. [3] In an effort to remain competitive and manage expenses, governments, building owners, building tenants, and companies in general are looking for ways to become more efficient both fiscally and environmentally. The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy reported that the cost of saving one unit of energy through energy efficiency is one-fifth (1/5) the cost required to generate that same unit of energy. As a result, we feel that the growth opportunities in the energy management market are in their infancy.
 
A 2017 report issued by Navigant Research, titled, “Energy Efficient Buildings Global Outlook”, stated that the global market for energy efficient building technologies is expected to reach nearly $360.6 billion in 2026.[4] The report asserts that the Internet-of-Things (“IoT”) is partly responsible for one of the most dramatic changes to the market landscape in its history, and that OEMs and providers are adjusting their strategies to address specific market needs. HVAC has been identified as one of nine key categories.
 
Telkonet’s key industries are all prime candidates for energy management, in part due to their utilizing energy “on-demand” or intermittently. Providing energy, and engaging the equipment to supply it, to those rooms and spaces only when occupied results in significant energy savings in addition to affording longer life and reduced maintenance to the HVAC systems.

Education Industry
 
Telkonet approaches the education industry with strategic relationships with enterprise energy service companies (“ESCOs’) throughout the USA. Telkonet partners with ESCOs to include our EcoSmart energy management platform for deployment within residence halls on university campuses. The ESCOs bundle our technology with other facility improvement measures designed to reduce operating costs across the entire campus, bundling solutions with acceptable ROI and which meet state mandated guidelines. ESCOs also structure self-funding financial transactions called “Performance Contracts” in which the savings are greater than the repayment costs, typically guaranteeing the financial and operational performance in this type of engagement. This type of approach can remove any capital expense barriers and improve adoption.
 
In addition to an installed base of University of California, Davis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Kansas State University, North Carolina State University, University of Notre Dame, US Military Academy at West Point, Columbia University, and Texas A&M University-Commerce, we have recently added University of Houston – Victoria.
 
The opportunities in this market are not limited to higher education institutions. According to an NRG Business Energy Advisor report, schools in the United States spend $8 billion on energy costs annually, with 73% of natural gas use going towards heating and 35% of electricity consumption going towards cooling. While heating and cooling account for only 2 – 4% of district costs, it is an opportunity for significant impact and gain.
 
We believe that our EcoSmart Platform is an important tool for participants in the education industry seeking to control student-related energy costs. We have focused our sales efforts on members of the education industry who are seeking to expand their energy efficiency initiatives as well as the ESCOs who target the educational marketplace and have thus far had success with at least one school district installing EcoSmart in each classroom throughout the district.
 
Hospitality Industry
 
There is a constant balancing act for hotel operators between managing guest comfort and operating margins. The EcoSmart platform’s Recovery Time allows operators to manage operation costs yet still provide for a comfortable and engaging guest experience. In fact, the EcoSmart platform individual brands and properties can create a desired guest environment, and still allow for energy savings via the Recovery Time algorithm. Telkonet has proven that the EcoSmart platform can deliver a return on investment in less than three years for hospitality customers.
Government & Military Industry
 
The Department of Defense (“DOD”) is the single largest energy consumer in the United States, accounting for about 90 percent of the federal government’s energy use and using over 30,000 giga-watt hours of electricity per year. [5] Thus, we view this market as strategically significant to Telkonet’s interests.
 
Our energy management platform is already successfully incorporated into the energy initiatives in several military housing sites, military academies and barracks. Telkonet benefited from and continues to make use of government funding and other government contracts to provide EcoSmart for use on military bases and other facilities, helping both the DOD and the government as a whole achieve their long-term energy efficiency goals.

Healthcare Industry
 
Healthcare organizations currently spend over $6.5 billion on energy each year, a cost which continues to rise in an effort to meet patient needs. [6] This is viewed as an emerging market for energy management systems. Although hospitals have many specific regulatory mandates, Telkonet has been working closely with operators and developers of healthcare support facilities, like medical office buildings, assisted living and other similar facilities, to integrate our EcoSmart energy management initiatives into efficiency opportunities supported by state and federal energy programs. For example, hospital energy managers can use energy efficiency strategies to offset high costs caused by growing plug loads and rising energy prices. A typical 200,000-square-foot, 50-bed hospital in the U.S. annually spends $680,000, or roughly $13,611 per bed on electricity and natural gas. By increasing energy efficiency, hospitals can improve the bottom line and free up funds to invest in new technologies and improve patient care.
 
These facilities offer a commercial environment similar to the hospitality or educational housing markets, and the increasing aging population and assisted living markets presents attractive potential for energy efficiency. This market is expected to grow rapidly over the next several years due to its energy savings capabilities and an aging population.
 
Utility Industry
 
We continue to strengthen our focus on our targeted market segments in order to expand market share and take advantage of existing incentives for energy management. We expect continued expansion in the space, specifically in commercial segments due to increasing state and federal programs promoting energy efficiency. Our residential initiatives are also key to the future expansion of Telkonet’s EcoSmart programs within the developing Internet-of-Things environment.
Public Housing
 
Public housing, which are properties owned and managed by the government, is an additional emerging market for energy management solutions. The tenants occupying these properties must meet specific eligibility requirements, and their utility bills are typically paid for by government programs. Many of the ESCO clients that Telkonet supports today have dedicated teams pursuing opportunities with the owners and operators of government-subsidized housing. The EcoSmart platform is an ideal solution for conserving energy, allowing remote monitoring, and improving tenant comfort.
Competition for Markets
 
We currently compete primarily within commercial and industrial markets, including the hospitality, education, healthcare, public housing, MDU, government, utility and military sectors. Within each target market, we offer savings through our intelligent automation platform. Our products offer significant competitive and complementary benefits when compared with alternative offerings including Building Automation Systems (“BAS”) or Building Management Systems (“BMS”), static temperature occupancy-based systems, scheduling/programmable thermostats and high-efficiency HVAC systems.
 
We participate in a relatively small competitive field within the hospitality industry, with the majority of the energy management sales handled by fewer than seven manufacturers. The key competitors in the market segment are Inncom by Honeywell and Schneider Electric, with each offering some level of comparable products to our standalone and/or networked products. Telkonet leverages the above-mentioned competitive advantages to successfully compete in these spaces and win business.

The educational space is new to adopt occupancy-based controls. The EcoSmart Platform has been introduced for use within student dormitories, which traditionally had few, if any, controls. More recently we’ve also been requested to install our products into classrooms, which traditionally have been an environment for BAS/BMS. Since the dormitory environment is very similar to the hospitality market, we believe we offer similarly-scaled energy savings. Since the market is still in its infancy, very few comparable offerings have entered the market but competitors within the hospitality segment are beginning to respond. Again, our key differentiators allow us to compete and win business in this space.
 
The healthcare and government/military markets are very similar in scope, relative to energy management systems. A key differentiator in these environments is the specific implementation being considered. Each market utilizes BAS/BMS for wide scale energy management initiatives. When addressing housing environments, including elderly care and assisted living facilities and military dormitories or barracks, Telkonet’s EcoSmart Platform is able to provide increased energy savings and efficiency. Competitors operating in the BAS/BMS space include Honeywell, Schneider Electric, Johnson Controls, Siemens, Trane and others, many of whom Telkonet partners with to provide a comprehensive and integrated energy management solution to effectively address energy efficiency opportunities in all types of facilities.
 
Inventory
 
We are dependent, in certain situations, on a limited number of vendors to provide certain inventory and components. We’ve not experienced significant problems or issues purchasing any essential materials, parts or components, but have experienced gross profit pressure as a result of price increases and the impact of tariffs (discussed below). We contract the majority of our inventory with ATR Manufacturing, based in China, which provides substantially all the manufacturing requirements for Telkonet’s energy management platform.
Customers
 
We are neither limited to, nor reliant upon, a single or narrowly segmented customer base to derive our revenues. Our current primary focus is in the hospitality, commercial, education, utility, MDU, healthcare and government/military markets and expanding into the consumer market as part of our long term strategic growth.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, no single customer represented 10% or more of our revenues.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Telkonet has acquired certain intellectual properties, including but not limited to, Patent No. D569, 279, titled “Thermostat.”  Patent No. D569279 issued by the USPTO in May 2008 was granted on the ornamental design of a thermostat device and will expire in May of 2022. The expiration of this patent could allow third parties to launch competing products. While we viewed this patent as valuable, we do not view any single patent as material to the Company as a whole.
 
There can be no assurance that any of our current or future patent applications will be granted, or, if granted, that such patents will provide necessary protection for our technology or our product offerings, or be of commercial benefit to us.
 
Government Regulation
 
As discussed in Part I, Item IA, given we purchase the majority of our inventory from a supplier based in China, we are subject to and have been affected by the tariffs imposed by the United States Federal Government on imports of industrial sector products from China.
 
In addition, we are subject to regulation in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”).  FCC rules permit the operation of unlicensed digital devices that radiate radio frequency emissions if the manufacturer complies with certain equipment authorization procedures, technical requirements, marketing restrictions and product labeling requirements.

Future products designed by us will require testing for compliance with FCC and European Commission (“EC”) standards. Moreover, if in the future, the FCC or EC changes its technical requirements, further testing and/or modifications may be necessary in order to achieve compliance.
 
Research & Development 
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company spent $1,879,676 and $1,770,597, respectively, on research and development activities. Telkonet continues to invest significantly in research & development to maintain and grow our competitive differentiation and customer value. Key initiatives for 2019 include: expanding our EcoTouch product line with WIFI and Bluetooth wireless capabilities; creation of a new Gateway model with cellular wireless capabilities; expanding Symphony Composer development for next generation web management Internet of Things dashboard; and expanding data analytics engine integration into Symphony platform for savings algorithm development.
Additional Information
 
Employees 
 
As of April 1, 2019, we had 50 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. We will continue to hire additional personnel as necessary to meet future operating requirements. We anticipate that we may need to hire additional staff in the areas of customer support, field services, engineering, sales and marketing, and administration.
Environmental Matters
 
We do not anticipate any material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position due to compliance with government regulations involving environmental matters.
 
Discontinued Operations
 
In October of 2016, the Company decided to offer for sale its Ethostream High-Speed Internet Access (“HSIA”) subsidiary. While EthoStream is one of the largest public HSIA providers in the world, providing services to more than 12.0 million users monthly across a network of approximately 1,800 locations, the Company will focus on its higher growth potential EcoSmart Platform line. The operating results of Ethostream for the years ended December 31, 2017 have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company closed the sale of EthoStream, LLC on March 29, 2017 and the impact on the Company’s liquidity as a result of the proceeds from the sale is expected to allow for greater strategic investment in marketing and research and development by the Company.
