Narrative Description of Business
Products manufactured and supplied, and services rendered, by the Company are divided into two reportable segments: the Environmental Solutions Group and the Safety and Security Systems Group. The individual operating businesses are organized as such because they share certain characteristics, including technology, marketing, distribution and product application, which create long-term synergies. Corporate contains those items that are not included in our reportable segments.
Financial information concerning the Company’s two reportable segments for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, is included in Note 16 – Segment Information to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein by reference. Information regarding the Company’s discontinued operations is included in Note 18 – Discontinued Operations to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein by reference.
Environmental Solutions Group
Our Environmental Solutions Group is a leading manufacturer and supplier of a full range of street sweeper vehicles, sewer cleaner and vacuum loader trucks, hydro-excavation trucks, high-performance waterblasting equipment, dump truck bodies and trailers. The Group manufactures vehicles and equipment in the U.S. and Canada that are sold under the Elgin®, Vactor®, Guzzler®, WestechTM, Jetstream®, Ox Bodies®, Crysteel®, J-Craft®, Duraclass®, Rugby® and Travis® brand names. Products are sold to both municipal and industrial customers either through a dealer network or direct sales to service customers generally depending on the type and geographic location of the customer. The acquisition of substantially all of the assets and operations of Joe Johnson Equipment, Inc. and Joe Johnson Equipment (USA), Inc. (collectively, “JJE”) in 2016 extended the Environmental Solutions Group’s existing sales channel and increased the number of service centers through which its parts, service and rental offerings can be provided to current and potential customers. The acquisition of JJE also broadened the Environmental Solutions Group’s product offerings to include other products, such as refuse and recycling collection vehicles, camera systems, ice resurfacing equipment and snow-removal equipment. In addition to vehicle and equipment sales, the Group also engages in the sale of parts, service and repair, equipment rentals and training as part of a complete offering to its current and potential customers through its service centers located across North America.
Under the Elgin brand name, the Company sells a leading U.S. brand of street sweepers primarily designed for large-scale cleaning of curbed streets, parking lots and other paved surfaces utilizing mechanical sweeping, vacuum and recirculating air technology. Vactor is a leading manufacturer of vacuum trucks used to maintain sewer lines, catch basins and storm sewers, as well as hydro-excavation trucks to meet the need for safe and non-destructive excavation. Guzzler is a leader in industrial vacuum loaders used to manage industrial waste or recover and recycle valuable raw materials. Westech is a manufacturer of high-quality, rugged vacuum trucks. Jetstream manufactures high pressure waterblast equipment and accessories for commercial and industrial cleaning and maintenance operations. The Company manufactures and sells dump truck bodies and trailers under the Ox Bodies, Crysteel, J-Craft, Duraclass, Rugby and Travis brand names.
Safety and Security Systems Group
Our Safety and Security Systems Group is a leading manufacturer and supplier of comprehensive systems and products that law enforcement, fire rescue, emergency medical services, campuses, military facilities and industrial sites use to protect people and property.

Marketing and Distribution
Depending primarily on the type and geographic location of the end-customer, the Environmental Solutions Group uses either a dealer network, including JJE, or direct sales to serve customers. The 2017 acquisition of Truck Bodies and Equipment International (“TBEI”) increased the number of dealers within our network and also added additional direct sales resources. The dealer network serves both municipal and industrial end markets. Within municipal markets, the majority of our dealers operate exclusively in their assigned territory. In conjunction with selling vehicles to end-customers, dealer representatives demonstrate vehicle functionality and capability and provide vehicle service. In addition to selling products manufactured by the Company, JJE distributes and re-sells products manufactured by other companies. The Company believes its regional, national and global dealer networks for vehicles is a distinguishing factor from its competitors. The Environmental Solutions Group’s direct sales channel concentrates on the industrial, utility and construction market segments, and the service centers provide post-sale service, ancillary parts and equipment rentals. The acquisition of JJE increased the number of service centers through which its parts, service and rental offerings can be provided to current and potential customers. 
The Safety and Security Systems Group sells to industrial customers through wholesalers and distributors who are supported by Company sales personnel or independent manufacturer representatives. Products are also sold to municipal and governmental customers through active independent distributors, as well as through original equipment manufacturers and the direct sales force. The Company sells comprehensive integrated warning and interoperable communications through a combination of the direct sales force and independent distributors. International sales are made through independent foreign distributors or on a direct basis. 
Customers and Backlog
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s net sales in any year within the three-year period ended December 31, 2018. Of the $1,173.2 million total orders reported in 2018, approximately 31% were from U.S. municipal and governmental customers, 47% were from U.S. commercial and industrial customers and 22% were from non-U.S. customers.
During 2018, the Company’s U.S. municipal and governmental orders increased by 3% compared to 2017 levels, primarily due to improved orders for sewer cleaners and public safety products, partially offset by lower orders for outdoor warning systems. During 2017, the Company’s U.S. municipal and governmental orders increased by 18% compared to 2016 levels, driven by improved orders for street sweepers and sewer cleaners, as well as additional orders for dump truck bodies following the acquisition of TBEI. 
During 2018, the Company’s U.S. industrial and commercial orders increased by 29% from 2017 levels, largely attributable to improved orders for vacuum trucks, the effects of a full year of TBEI orders in 2018 compared to seven months of activity in 2017, and increased orders for outdoor warning systems within the Safety and Security Systems Group. During 2017, the Company’s U.S. commercial and industrial orders increased by 140% from 2016 levels, largely attributable to improved orders for sewer cleaners and vacuum trucks, the addition of orders following the TBEI acquisition, the effects of a full year of JJE orders in 2017 compared to seven months of activity in 2016, and increased orders from industrial markets within the Safety and Security Systems Group. 
During 2018, the Company’s non-U.S. orders increased by 8% from 2017, largely due to a $7.8 million increase within the Environmental Solutions Group, reflecting increased orders for vacuum trucks, sewer cleaners and street sweepers, as well as the effects of higher aftermarket demand. These increases were partially offset by lower orders for refuse trucks. Within the Safety and Security Systems Group, non-U.S. orders increased by $11.7 million, driven by improved orders from international public safety markets. During 2017, the Company’s non-U.S. orders increased by 21% from 2016, largely due to a $35.6 million increase within the Environmental Solutions Group, reflecting increased Canadian orders following the acquisition of JJE in June of 2016. Within the Safety and Security Systems Group, non-U.S. orders increased by $5.2 million, driven by improved orders in industrial and coal markets, partially offset by reduced orders from international public safety markets. 
Of the Company’s non-U.S. orders received in 2018, approximately 62% were from Canada, 19% were from Europe and less than 10% were from any other particular region. Non-U.S. municipal and governmental markets are similar to the U.S. municipal and governmental markets in that they are largely dependent on tax revenues to support spending and orders may be subject to budgetary cycles and public-entity bid procedures. 
The Company’s backlog totaled $337.7 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $257.5 million at December 31, 2017. The increase of $80.2 million, or 31%, was attributable to higher demand for vacuum trucks, sewer cleaners and street sweepers. Backlogs vary by group due to the nature of the Company’s products and the buying patterns of its customers. TBEI’s product lines typically experience average lead times ranging from one to three months. Following the acquisition of TBEI, the Environmental Solutions Group typically experiences an average backlog of approximately three to six months of shipments.

The Safety and Security Systems Group typically experiences an average backlog of approximately two months of shipments. Production of the Company’s December 31, 2018 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2019.
Suppliers
The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials from around the world for use in the manufacture of its products, although the majority of current purchases are from North American sources. To minimize risks relating to availability, price and quality of key products and components, the Company is party to numerous strategic supplier arrangements. Although certain materials are obtained from either a single-source supplier or a limited number of suppliers, the Company has generally identified alternative sources to minimize the interruption of its business in the event of supply disruptions.
Components critical to the production of the Company’s vehicles, such as engines, are purchased from a select number of suppliers. The Company also purchases raw and fabricated steel, as well as commercial chassis, from multiple sources. In addition, we may incorporate chassis provided directly by our customers in our production process. As a distributor of equipment manufactured by other companies, JJE relies on the availability of equipment supplied by others to meet customer demand. 
While there are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of certain raw materials and components that could impact price, quality and availability in sufficient quantities, the Company believes it has adequate supplies and sources of availability of the raw materials and components necessary to meet its needs.
Competition
Within the Environmental Solutions Group, Elgin is recognized as a market leader among domestic sweeper competitors and differentiates itself primarily on product performance. The Vactor and Guzzler brands each maintain a leading domestic position in their respective marketplaces by enhancing product performance with leading technology and application flexibility. Jetstream is a market leader in the in-plant cleaning segment of the U.S. waterblast industry, competing on product performance, rapid delivery and solutions services. JJE is a leading Canadian-based distributor of maintenance equipment for municipal and industrial markets. TBEI includes a portfolio of regional brands with market leadership positions in distinct geographies and product categories, differentiating itself with its broad regional distribution network, focus on customer responsiveness and operational expertise.
Within specific product categories and domestic markets, the businesses within the Safety and Security Systems Group are among the market leaders. The Group’s international market position varies from leader to ancillary participant depending on the geographic region and product line. Generally, competition is intense within all of the Group’s product lines and purchase decisions are made based on price, features, reputation, performance and service, often within competitive bidding situations.
Patents and Trademarks
The Company owns a number of patents and possesses rights under others to which it attaches importance, but it does not believe that its business as a whole is materially dependent upon any such patents or rights. The Company also owns a number of trademarks, including those listed within the “Narrative Description of Business” section above. We believe these trademarks are important in connection with the identification of our products and associated goodwill with customers, but no material part of the Company’s business is dependent on our trademarks.
Employees
The Company employed approximately 3,300 people in its businesses at December 31, 2018, with the Company’s U.S. hourly workers accounting for approximately 52% of its total workforce. Approximately 17% of the Company’s U.S. hourly workers were represented by unions at December 31, 2018. The Company believes that its labor relations with its employees are good.
Governmental Regulation of the Environment
The Company believes it complies with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. The Company endeavors to establish environmentally-friendly policies and objectives, and believes that these actions are also consistent with cost-effective operating practices. Capital expenditures in 2018 attributable to compliance with such laws were not material. The Company believes that the overall impact of compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.
In May 2012, the Company sold a facility in Pearland, Texas. The facility was previously used by the Company’s discontinued Pauluhn business, which manufactured marine, offshore and industrial lighting products. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, 
4

$0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of reserves related to the environmental remediation of the Pearland facility have been included in liabilities of discontinued operations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s estimate may change as more information becomes available; however, the costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flow.
Seasonality
Certain of the Company’s businesses are susceptible to the influences of seasonal factors, including buying patterns, delivery patterns and productivity influences from holiday periods and weather. In general, the Company tends to have lower equipment sales in the first calendar quarter of each year compared to other quarters as a result of these factors. In addition, rental income and parts sales are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, because many of the Company’s products are used for maintenance activities in North America, where usage is typically lower during periods of harsher weather conditions.
