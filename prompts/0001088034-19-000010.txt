ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General

Payment Data Systems, Inc. was founded in July 1998 and incorporated in the State of Nevada. We provide integrated payment processing services to merchants and businesses, including all types of Automated Clearing House, or ACH, processing, credit, prepaid card and debit card-based processing services. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, FiCentive, Inc., we offer prepaid card processing and program management services for various other card programs, including incentive cards for clinical trial recipients, consumer gift cards, rebate cards, and various card programs that can be branded or white labeled. The Akimbo Mastercard, via the domain name www.akimbocard.com, offers prepaid cards to consumers for use as a tool to stay on budget, manage allowances and share money with family and friends. Our Akimbo platform includes Akimbo Now for businesses, Akimbo Gift for consumers and support for Apple Pay®, Samsung Pay™ and Google Pay™. We introduced a PIN-less debit product that allows merchants to debit and credit accounts in real-time in October 2016. In our 20-year history, we have created a loyal customer base that relies on us for our convenient, secure, innovative and adaptive services and technology, and we have built long-standing and valuable relationships with premier banking institutions such as Fifth-Third Bank, Sunrise Bank, and Wells Fargo Bank.
We are constantly working on improving our existing offerings and innovating the payment processing experience. Our newest product introduced in February 2019 is a comprehensive money disbursement platform that allows businesses to pay their contractors, employees, or other recipients by choosing between a prepaid debit Mastercard, real-time deposit to a checking account, traditional ACH, direct deposit or paper check.
On September 1, 2017, we closed the acquisition of Singular Payments, LLC. Singular Payments is a Fintech payments provider that relies upon innovative technology to process payments for merchants in healthcare and other niche markets nationwide. Singular Payments is primarily focused on custom software integrations of their flat rate payment processing offerings and their proprietary, simple-to-use electronic bill payment presentment and payment platform that allows merchants to streamline the costly and labor-intensive process of invoicing and collections. Through the Singular Payments acquisition, we acquired an existing portfolio of customers with a significant revenue stream and a talented sales force with significant experience in the credit card industry. 
Payment Data Systems, Inc. We provide integrated electronic payment processing services to merchants and businesses, including credit and debit card-based processing services and transaction processing via the ACH network. The ACH network is a nationwide electronic funds transfer system that is regulated by the Federal Reserve and the National Automatic Clearing House Association, or NACHA, the electronic payments association, and provides for the clearing of electronic payments between participating financial institutions. Our ACH processing services enable merchants or businesses to both disburse and collect funds electronically using e-checks instead of traditional paper checks. An e-check is an electronic debit to a bank checking account that is initiated at the point-of-sale, on the Internet, over the telephone, or via a bill payment sent through the mail. E-checks are processed using the ACH network. We are one of seven companies that hold the prestigious NACHA certification for Third-Party Senders, and was only the second company to receive the certification.

Our card-based processing services enable merchants to process both traditional card-present, or "swipe" transactions, as well as card-not-present transactions. A traditional card-present transaction occurs whenever a card holder physically presents a credit or debit card to a merchant at the point-of-sale. A card-not-present transaction occurs whenever the customer does not physically present a payment card at the point-of-sale and may occur over the Internet, mail, fax or telephone.
The Company's strategy is to drive growth through a leveraged, one to many, distribution model in the software development marketplace. Following the completion of the Singular Payments acquisition, we launched our payment facilitation, PayFac, platform called "PayFac-in-a-Box" in late 2018 targeting partnership opportunities with app and software developers in bill-centric verticals, such as healthcare, property management, utilities and insurance verticals. The PayFac-in-a-Box platform 'integration layer' offers a simple integration experience for technology companies who are looking to monetize payments within an existing base of downstream clients. The added value of offering our integration partners access to credit card, debit card, ACH and prepaid card issuance capabilities through a single vendor partner relationship in face-to-face, mobile and virtual payment acceptance environments provides a true single channel commerce experience through an application programming interface, API. 

Our electronic payment processing may take place in a variety of forms and situations. For example, our capabilities allow merchants to convert a paper check to an e-check or receive card authorization at the point-of-sale, allow our merchants’ respective customer 
service representatives to take e-check or card payments from their consumers by telephone, and to enable their consumers to make e-check or card payments directly through the use of a website or by calling an interactive voice response telephone system. 
FiCentive, Inc. We provide prepaid card issuance services for corporate clients and consumers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, FiCentive, Inc. We develop and manage a variety of Mastercard-branded prepaid card program types, including consumer reloadable, consumer gift, incentive, promotional, general disbursement and corporate expense cards. 
Through our December 2014 acquisition of the assets of Akimbo Financial, Inc., we also added a highly talented technical staff of industry subject matter experts and an innovative cardholder service platform including cardholder web and mobile applications. These cardholder web and mobile applications have been fully integrated into FiCentive’s prepaid card core processor, and now support all program types and brands offered by FiCentive and its clients.

Industry Background
In the United States, the use of non-paper-based forms of payment, such as credit and debit cards, has risen steadily over the past several years. According to the 2016 Federal Reserve Payments Study (issued every three years), the Federal Reserve Payments Study: 2017 Annual Supplement and the Federal Reserve Payments Study: 2018 Supplement, the estimated number of non-cash payments continue to increase at accelerated rates.

- | ACH payments exhibited accelerating growth, increasing 5.7% by number and 6.9% by value from 2016 to 2017.


- | Card payments continued to show robust growth from 2016 to 2017, collectively increasing 10.1% by number and 8.4% by value. These increases represent an acceleration in overall card payment growth compared with the previously reported 2015 to 2016 and 2012 to 2015 periods. 


- | Since 2016, total card payments - the sum of credit card, non-prepaid debit card and prepaid debit card payments - increased 11.3 billion to reach 123.5 billion payments by number and increased $0.50 trillion to reach $6.48 trillion by value in 2017.


- | Within card payments, there was a surge in prepaid and non-prepaid debit card payments by number relative to credit card payments from 2016 to 2017, a change from previous reporting periods. Prepaid debit card payments had the highest growth rate, by number, at 10.5%, compared with 10.4% for non-prepaid debit card payments and 9.4% for credit card payments from 2016 to 2017. 


- | Remote payments continued to grow as a share of total general-purpose card payments. The number of remote payments increased 22.8% from 2016 to 2017, compared with in-person payments, which grew 7.2%. Over the same period, the value of remote payments increased 14.8%, compared to in-person payments, which increased 4.4%. 


- | Chip authenticated payments accounted for more than half of the value of in-person general-purpose card payments in 2017. Consistent with the 2015 and 2016 period, in-person chip-authenticated card payments continued to post substantial gains, increasing from 19.0% of all in-person general-purpose card payments by number and 26.4% by value in 2016 to 41.6% by number and 51.5% by value in 2017. 

Figure 1 (below), illustrates the overall growth in key non-cash metrics since the Federal Reserve Payments Study was first reported for the year 2000 and reflects the acceleration of growth in recent years.

The growth of electronic commerce has made the acceptance of card-based and other electronic forms of payment a necessity for businesses, both large and small, in order to remain competitive. We believe that the electronic payment processing industry will continue to benefit from the following trends:
Favorable Demographics

As consumers age, we expect that they will continue to use the payment technology to which they have grown accustomed. More consumers are beginning to use card-based and other electronic payment methods for purchases at an earlier age. These consumers have witnessed the wide adoption of card products, technology innovations such as mobile phone payment applications, and widespread adoption of the Internet. As younger consumers comprise an increasing percentage of the population and as they enter the work force, we expect purchases using electronic payment methods will become a larger percentage of total consumer spending. We believe the increasing usage of smart phones as an instrument of payment will also create further opportunities for us in the future. We also believe that contact-less payments like Apple Pay®™, Samsung Pay™ and Google Pay™ will increase payment processing opportunities for us.
Increased Electronic Payment Acceptance by Small Businesses

Small businesses are a vital component of the U.S. economy and are expected to contribute to the increased use of electronic payment methods. The lower costs associated with electronic payment methods are making these services more affordable to a larger segment of the small business market. In addition, we believe these businesses are experiencing increased pressure to accept electronic payment methods in order to remain competitive and to meet consumer expectations. As a result, many of these small businesses are seeking to provide customers with the ability to pay for merchandise and services using electronic payment methods, including those in industries that have historically accepted cash and checks as the only forms of payment for their merchandise and services.
Growth in Online Transactions

Market researchers expect continued growth in card-not-present transactions due to the steady growth of the Internet and electronic commerce. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, estimated retail e-commerce sales for 2018 were estimated at $513.6 billion, an increase of approximately 14.2% from 2017.
Products and Services
All of our service offerings are supported by our systems’ infrastructure that integrates certain proprietary components with processing systems outsourced to third-party providers to offer our customers a flexible and secure payment process. We utilize secure sockets layer architecture so that connections and information are secure from outside inspection. We also use 128-bit encryption for all electronic transactions that we process to make information unreadable as it passes over the Internet. Our systems’ infrastructure allows us to work with our customers to build a customized electronic payment service offering tailored to the customer's specific needs. We have designed and implemented our integrated payment systems to function as gateways between 
our customers and our third-party processing providers. Our systems provide for interfaces with our customers through which payment data is captured electronically and transferred through the connections we have with our processing providers. Our systems also provide a data warehousing capability so that all payment data related to a customer can be stored in one place to facilitate efficient data retrieval and analysis. All confidential data stored within and outside the data warehouse is fully encrypted. We outsource our ACH transaction processing and card-based transaction processing to third-party providers. Our card-based processing system is capable of connecting with all of the major card-based processors in the United States.
Payment Processing. The components of our service offerings include all forms of ACH transaction processing, such as Represented Check, which is a consumer non-sufficient funds check that is presented for payment electronically rather than through the paper check collection system, and Accounts Receivable Check Conversion, which is a consumer paper check payment that is converted into an e-check. Our customers can initiate ACH transactions directly using an online terminal accessible through a website or we can initiate ACH transactions on their behalf. Our service offering also includes merchant account services for the processing of card-based transactions through the VISA, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, and JCB networks, including online terminal services accessed through a website or retail services accessed via a physical terminal. We offer a proprietary web-based customer service application that combines both ACH and card processing capabilities that allows companies to process one-time and recurring payments via e-checks or credit cards at the request of their consumers. In addition, we offer an Interactive Voice Response telephone system to companies that accept payments directly from consumers over the telephone using e-checks or credit cards.
In October 2015, we introduced e-check verification technology, which helps merchants prevent returns before processing and reduces return check transactions. This service utilizes our proprietary returns database that contains records for any transaction that we had previously attempted to process and if a transaction was unsuccessful for account closed, invalid account, non-sufficient funds, payment stopped, frozen account, unauthorized account, and others. Merchants query this database in advance of submitting a transaction for processing and settlement. Merchants utilize this data to make their own determination if they wish to process a payment or not. We charge a transaction fee for each query and for each account that a query returns data.

Significant innovations to our payment systems have included launching a brand new client facing web application that allows customers to more easily manage their payments; an Apple® iOS Software Development Kit, or SDK, that enables developers to easily integrate payment acceptance into their applications; and a new PINless debit service that allows merchants to debit and credit accounts in real time. 
In 2017, our product and service enhancements included upgrading our customer service portal by adding two-factor authentication, improving reporting, enhancing the transaction file upload process and improving fraud / return transaction monitoring, implementing and enhancing our payment facilitator model, and continuing to update and enhance our Akimbo Card website and mobile app modules, which also enhanced our new card order and fulfillment module.
In 2018, our product and service enhancements included adding a batch load payment facilitator enrollment platform marketed to integrated software vendors, ISVs, for quickly onboarding mass merchant accounts simultaneously, integrating two new payment facilitator gateways for credit cards and one new gateway for our PINless debit cards, enhancing our merchant services API with new methods and speed enhancements and introducing Text-2-Give and Text-2-Pay products for texting payments targeted at our tithing and recurring payment merchants.
We will continue to enhance our service offerings to meet customer demands as they arise. 
Prepaid and Incentive Card Issuance. We also provide a variety of prepaid and incentive card issuance services and operate a prepaid core processing platform. We are a program manager and have card issuance agreements with Sunrise Banks, N.A. and Metropolitan Commercial Bank. We develop and manage a variety of prepaid card program types, including consumer reloadable, consumer gift, incentive, promotional, general disbursement and corporate expense cards, primarily on behalf of our corporate clients. We exclusively issue Mastercard branded cards currently, but our platform also supports the issuance of Visa and Discover branded card programs. In addition, we design, develop and operate feature-rich cardholder web and mobile applications. These web and mobile applications can be branded and customized by corporate clients. In addition, our clients can also brand or white-label physical cards and card package materials, as well as digital cards stored in popular mobile wallets. Clients can order and load virtual and physical cards in bulk using a batch processing system available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through the web or secure file transfer protocol, FTP. There are also more than 75 API endpoints available for direct client integrations. In addition to providing card issuance and money disbursement solutions to corporate clients, we issue general purpose consumer reloadable cards direct to consumers under the Akimbo and Stream card brands. These consumer card programs work as bank account alternatives or companion cards used for household budgets and allowances. Our card issuance platform is integrated to Mastercard’s Digital Enablement Services, or MDES, enabling full control of card provisioning to all popular mobile wallets, including Apple Pay®, Google Pay™ and Samsung Pay™ . This integration has allowed our platform to offer several unique features to both cardho
lders and our corporate clients, including in-app provisioning, customized mobile wallet branding, and the real-time delivery of and access to the digital card prior to the receipt of the corresponding physical card. In general, our proprietary, full-stack card issuance and processing platform provides us with several competitive advantages as compared to other program managers and prepaid card providers. Our platform offers several features unavailable with nearly any other prepaid card processors. In addition, the platform and the current size of our organization enables us to prototype and deploy custom solutions much quicker than the competition. This is highlighted by the fact that several large / Fortune 500 tech and payments companies currently use our platform for research and developments purposes.
Relationships with Sponsors and Processors
We have agreements with several processors that provide to us, on a non-exclusive basis, transaction processing and transmittal, transaction authorization and data capture, and access to various reporting tools. In order to provide payment processing services for ACH transactions, we must maintain a relationship with an Originating Depository Financial Institution, or ODFI, in the ACH network because we are not a bank and therefor we are not eligible to be an ODFI. For the ODFI portion of our ACH business, we have entered into agreements with the Fifth Third Bank, North American Banking Company, or NABC, Evolve Bank & Trust, and Metropolitan Commercial Bank. We are financially liable for all fees, fines, charge backs and losses related to our ACH processing merchant customers. We may also require cash deposits and other types of collateral from certain merchants to mitigate any such risk. Similarly, in order to provide payment-processing services for Visa, Mastercard and Discover transactions, we must be sponsored by a financial institution that is a principal member of the respective Visa, Mastercard and Discover card associations. Central Bank of St. Louis and Wells Fargo Bank have, respectively, sponsored us under the designations Third Party Processor, or TPP, and Independent Sales Organization, or ISO, with the Visa card association, and under the designations Third Party Servicer, or TPS, and Merchant Service Provider, or MSP, with the Mastercard card association. We have an agreement with TriSource Solutions, LLC and an agreement with Global Payments, Inc. through which their member banks, Central Bank of St. Louis and Wells Fargo Bank, sponsor us for membership in the Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover card associations and settle card transactions for our merchants. These agreements may be terminated by the processor if we materially breach the agreements and we do not cure the breach within 30 days, or if we enter bankruptcy or file for bankruptcy. We also maintain a bank sponsorship agreement with Sunrise Banks, N.A. and Metropolitan Commercial Bank for our prepaid card programs. We are liable for any card-associated losses for cards that we issue that might incur a negative balance and we are liable for card association fines, fees and chargebacks.
Under our processing agreement with TriSource Solutions and Vantiv, we are financially liable for all fees, fines, chargebacks and losses related to our card processing merchant customers. Under our processing agreement with Global Payments, Inc., we are not financially liable for all fees, charge-backs and losses related to our card processing merchant customers, but we are liable for potential card association fines. If, due to insolvency or bankruptcy of our merchant customers, or for another reason, we are unable to collect from our merchant customers amounts that have been refunded to the cardholders because the cardholders properly initiated a charge-back transaction to reverse the credit card charges, we must bear the credit risk for the full amount of the card holder transaction. We utilize a number of systems and procedures to evaluate and manage merchant risk, such as obtaining approval of prospective merchants from our processor and sponsor bank, setting transaction limits and monitoring account activity. We may also require cash deposits and other types of collateral from certain merchants to mitigate any such risk. We maintain a reserve for losses resulting from card processing and related charge-backs. We estimate our potential loss for charge-backs by performing a historical analysis of our charge-back loss experience with similar merchants and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future, such as the types of card transactions processed and nature of the merchant relationship with their consumers.

We are currently sponsored by Evolve Bank & Trust to access certain regional debit networks. Through this sponsorship, we created a new service in late 2016 to provide both the issuance of real time credits and debits to a debit card holder via a regional network without using a PIN.  Regional networks are not affiliated with major credit card associations and operate independently. Through our sponsorship with Evolve Bank & Trust, we are financially liable for all fees, fines, charge backs and losses related to our PINless debit card processing for our merchant customers. We may also require cash deposits and other types of collateral from certain merchants to mitigate any such risk.  The banking sponsor and each of the regional debit networks have the ability to terminate our access or anyone of our merchant’s access to process payments without notice.  If either case occurs, our revenue could be negatively affected. In January 2018, our old sponsor, Pueblo Bank and Trust, terminated their relationship with our gateway provider and as a result we stopped processing PINless debit transactions for a short period of time. We secured a relationship with Evolve Bank & Trust and have resumed processing PINless debit transactions. We are in the process of securing a second bank sponsor that will provide access for additional merchant networks.
We maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability or failure of our merchant customers to make required payments for fees charged by us. Amounts due from customers may be deemed uncollectible because of merchant disputes, fraud, insolvency or bankruptcy. We determine the allowance based on an account-by-account review, taking into consideration such 
factors as the age of the outstanding receivable, historical pattern of collections and financial condition of the customer. We closely monitor extensions of credit and if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make contractual payments, additional allowances may be required.

Sales and Marketing

We market and sell our ACH products and services primarily through non-exclusive resellers that act as an external sales force, with minimal direct investment in sales infrastructure and management, as well as direct contact by our sales personnel. Our direct sales efforts are coordinated by two sales executives and supported by other employees who function in sales capacities. Our primary market focus is on companies generating high volumes of electronic payment transactions. We tailor our sales efforts to reach this market by pre-qualifying prospective sales leads through direct contact or market research. Our sales personnel typically initiate contact with prospective customers that we identify as meeting our targeted customer profile. 
On September 1, 2017, we acquired Singular Payments, LLC. Singular Payments was a credit card processing Independent Sales Organization, or ISO, comprised primarily of highly driven sales leaders and industry leaders. Through the Singular Payments acquisition, we also acquired an existing portfolio of customers with a significant revenue stream and a talented sales force with significant experience in the credit card industry. 
We also market and sell our prepaid card program directly to corporations and to consumers through the Internet. A major initiative will be the packaging and cross selling of our platform of payment options across our portfolio of merchants. As a part of this major initiative, we will continue to analyze our sales and marketing efforts to optimize productivity, increase sales force effectiveness, broaden our reach through reseller initiatives and advantageous alliances and effectively optimize sales and marketing expenses while meeting our revenue and profit objectives.
Customers

Our customers are merchants and businesses that use our Automated Clearing House and/or card-based processing services in order to provide their consumers with the ability to pay for goods and services without having to use cash or a paper check. These merchant customers operate in a variety of predominately retail industries and are under contract with us to exclusively use the services that we provide to them. Recent areas of customer focus have included system integrators, churches, charitable organizations, medical and dental clinics, doctor's offices, property management and homeowner associations, hospitality firms and municipalities. Most of our merchant customers have signed long-term contracts, generally with three-year terms, that provide for volume-based transaction fees. Our merchant accounts increased to 1,958 customers at December 31, 2018 from 1,817 customers at December 31, 2017. Our customers are consumers geographically dispersed throughout the United States. 

No customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues in 2018 or 2017.
Competition

The payment processing industry is highly competitive. Many small and large companies compete with us in providing payment processing services and related services to a wide range of merchants. There are a number of large transaction processors, including First Data Merchant Services Corporation, Elavon Inc., and WorldPay that serve a broad market spectrum from large to small merchants and provide banking, automatic teller machine, and other payment-related services and systems in addition to card-based payment processing. There are also a large number of smaller transaction processors that provide various services to small and medium-sized merchants. Many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources than us and operate as subsidiaries of financial or bank holding companies, which may allow them on a consolidated basis to own and conduct depository and other banking activities that we do not have the regulatory authority to own or conduct. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include:

• | quality of service;


• | reliability of service;


• | ability to evaluate, undertake and manage risk;


• | ability to offer customized technology solutions;


• | speed in implementing payment processes;


• | price and other financial terms; and


• | multi-channel payment capability.

We believe that our specific focus on providing integrated payment processing solutions to merchants, in addition to our keen understanding of the needs and risks associated with providing payment processing services electronically, gives us a competitive 
advantage over other competitors, which have a narrower market perspective, and over competitors of a similar or smaller size that may lack our experience and expertise in the electronic payments industry. Furthermore, we believe we present a competitive distinction through our internal technology to provide a single integrated payment warehouse that consolidates, processes, tracks and reports all payments regardless of payment source or channel. We also believe our customized technology solutions and high level of service provides a competitive advantage, particularly for smaller businesses that do not have large internal technology capabilities or the ability to comply with payment security regulations.

Our prepaid card offerings are competitive due to our proprietary systems and our ability to create and establish corporate-branded card programs in shorter time frames than our competitors. We also believe that our ten years of prepaid industry experience in processing and managing prepaid card programs is a competitive advantage over many of our competitors. We believe our connectivity and the ability to process via the contact-less networks of Apple Pay®™, Samsung Pay™ and Google Pay™ are competitive advantages. We also believe that the Akimbo mobile application technology and advanced card holder websites provide a competitive advantage in securing both consumers and business clients that have a need for a card program for their customer base. We also believe we hold a significant competitive advantage over potential entrants into the prepaid industry as a result of the significant barrier in obtaining bank sponsorships for prepaid card program management and an even higher barrier for performing prepaid card processing.

We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our services and related products.

Patents

On January 11, 2008, we executed an agreement to sell selected patents and patent applications, including U.S. Patent No. 7,021,530, to PCT Software Data, LLC for net proceeds of approximately $750,000. The patents and patent applications sold relate to bill payments made with debit and stored value cards. We retained a worldwide, non-exclusive license under the patents for use with all current and future customers. 
Government Regulation

Our industry is highly regulated. Any new, or changes made to, U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations, card network rules or other industry standards affecting our business may require significant development efforts or have an unfavorable impact to our financial results. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines. Certain of our services are also subject to rules set by various payment networks, such as Visa and Mastercard.
The Dodd-Frank Act

President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act caused significant structural reforms to the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act regulates the fees charged or received by issuers for processing debit transactions and the transaction routing options available to merchants. The Dodd-Frank Act also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to regulate consumer financial services, including many services offered to our customers. These rules clarify the regulatory prepaid landscape for consumer access to disclosures, fees and statements, error resolution, limited liability and overdrafts. Additionally, the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions will now be regulated by the Federal Reserve and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transaction. In addition, the Durbin Amendment contains prohibitions on network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions.

The Dodd-Frank Act caused interchange fees to be lowered on large bank-issued debit cards. The lowered interchange fees had a mild negative impact on our revenues and increased our earnings due to the fact that we were able to keep our prices constant with our merchants. If our competitors start to pass the extra margin into savings to their merchants, we may be forced to follow their actions and become exposed to lower earnings on the debit card transactions for large banks. 

CARD Act

As an agent of, and third-party service provider to, our issuing banks, we are subject to indirect regulation and direct audit and examination by the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or FRB, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

On March 23, 2010, the FRB issued a final rule implementing Title IV of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009, or CARD Act, which imposes requirements relating to disclosures, fees and expiration dates that are generally applicable to gift certificates, store gift cards and general-use prepaid cards. We believe that our general purpose re-loadable prepaid cards, and the maintenance fees charged on our general purpose re-loadable cards, are exempt from the requirements under this rule, as they fall within an express exclusion for cards which are re-loadable and not marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate. However, this exclusion is not available if the issuer, the retailer selling the card to a consumer or the program manager, promotes, even if occasionally, the use of the card as a gift card or gift certificate. As a result, we provide retailers with instructions and policies regarding the display and promotion of our general purpose re-loadable cards. However, it is possible that despite our instructions and policies to the contrary, a retailer engaged in offering our general purpose re-loadable cards to consumers could take an action with respect to one or more of the cards that would cause each similar card to be viewed as being marketed or labeled as a gift card, such as by placing our general purpose re-loadable cards on a display which prominently features the availability of gift cards and does not separate or otherwise distinguish our general purpose re-loadable cards from the gift cards. In such event, it is possible that such general purpose re-loadable cards would lose their eligibility for such exclusion to the CARD Act and its requirements, and therefore we could be deemed to be in violation of the CARD Act and the rule, which could result in the imposition of fines, the suspension of our ability to offer our general purpose re-loadable cards, civil liability, criminal liability, and the inability of our issuing banks to apply certain fees to our general purpose re-loadable cards, each of which would likely have a material adverse impact on our revenues.

In 2014, we resumed issuing gift cards. Any gift cards we issue will be governed by the CARD Act and other various regulations. Any violations with our gift card issuance could result in the imposition of fines, the suspension of our ability to offer our gift cards, civil liability, criminal liability, and the inability of our issuing banks to apply certain fees to our gift cards, each of which would likely have a material adverse impact on our revenues.

Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Regulation

Our business is subject to U.S. federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, or collectively, the BSA. The BSA, among other things, requires money services businesses to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records. On September 29, 2017, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, amended the Customer Due Diligence Rule, or CDD Rule, requiring the collection and verification of beneficial owners holding equal to or greater than 25% equity interest. The CDD Rule states that sole proprietorships-individual or spousal-and unincorporated associations are not legal entity customers as defined by the Rule, even though such businesses may file with the Secretary of State in order to register a trade name or establish a tax account. This is because neither a sole proprietorship nor an unincorporated association is a separate legal entity from the associated individual(s), and therefore beneficial ownership is not inherently obscured. The CDD Rule does not rely on the tax-exempt status of an entity as described in the Internal Revenue Code “IRC”. All nonprofit entities-whether or not tax-exempt-that are established as a nonprofit, or non-stock corporation, or similar entity that has been validly organized with the proper State authority are excluded from the ownership/equity prong of the requirement because nonprofit entities generally do not have ownership interests. As of May 2018, we are required to collect and verify beneficial owners holding equal to or greater than 25% equity interest based on rules promulgated by FinCEN.

We are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, that prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, narcotics traffickers, and terrorists or terrorist organizations.

Similar anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified on lists maintained by organizations similar to OFAC in several other countries and which may impose specific data retention obligations or prohibitions on intermediaries in the payment process.
Prepaid Services

Prepaid card programs managed by us are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, which may include laws and regulations related to consumer and data protection, licensing, consumer disclosures, escheat, anti-money laundering, banking, trade practices and competition and wage and employment. As regulations evolve, or change, we may be required to obtain state licenses to expand our distribution network for prepaid cards, which licenses we may not be able to obtain. Furthermore, the CARD Act and the Federal Reserve’s Regulation E impose requirements on general-use prepaid cards, store gift cards and electronic gift certificates. These laws and regulations are evolving, unclear and sometimes inconsistent and subject to judicial and regulatory challenge and interpretation, and therefore the extent to which these laws and rules have application to, and their impact on, us, financial institutions, merchants or others is in flux. At this time, we are unable to determine the impact that the clarification of these laws and their future interpretations, as well as new laws, may have on us, financial institutions, merchants or others in a number of jurisdictions. Prepaid services may also be subject to the rules and regulations of Visa®, Mastercard® and other payment networks with which we and the card issuers do business. The programs in place to process these products generally may be modified by the payment networks at their discretion and such modifications could also impact us, financial institutions, merchants and others.
Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had 43 full-time employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are very good.
