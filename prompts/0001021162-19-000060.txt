This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 relating to our future operations and prospects, including statements that are based on current projections and expectations about the markets in which we operate, and management's beliefs concerning future performance and capital requirements based upon current available information. Such statements are based on management's beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management. When used in this document, words like "may," "might," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "believe," "potential," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from management's current expectations. For example, there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required or that additional capital, if required, will be available on reasonable terms, if at all, at such times and in such amounts as may be needed by us. In addition to these factors, among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, are uncertainties relating to the integration of acquired businesses, general economic conditions affecting our business segments, dependence of certain of our businesses on certain key customers, the risk that we will not realize all of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions as well as competitive factors relating to the aerospace industry. For a more detailed discussion of these and other factors affecting us, see the risk factors described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors."
General
Triumph Group, Inc. ("Triumph," the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") was incorporated in 1993 in Delaware. Our companies design, engineer, manufacture, repair, and overhaul a broad portfolio of aerospace and defense systems, components, and structures. We serve the global aviation industry, including original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and the full spectrum of military and commercial aircraft operators.

Certain financial information about our three segments is set forth in Note 2 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."
Proprietary Rights
We benefit from our proprietary rights relating to designs, engineering and manufacturing processes, and repair and overhaul procedures. For some products, our unique manufacturing capabilities are required by the customer's specifications or designs, thereby necessitating reliance on us for the production of such specially designed products.
We view our name and trademark as significant to our business as a whole. Our products are protected by a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses or other forms of intellectual property that expire at various dates in the future. We continually develop and acquire new intellectual property and consider all of our intellectual property to be valuable. However, based on the broad scope of our product lines, management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial position, or our business segments. Our policy is to file applications and obtain patents for our new products as appropriate, including product modifications and improvements. While patents generally expire 20 years after the patent application filing date, new patents are issued to us on a regular basis.
In our overhaul and repair businesses, OEMs of equipment that we maintain for our customers often include language in repair manuals that relate to their equipment, asserting broad claims of proprietary rights to the contents of the manuals used in our operations. There can be no assurance that OEMs will not try to enforce such claims, including the possible use of legal proceedings. In the event of such legal proceedings, there can be no assurance that such actions against the Company will be unsuccessful. However, we believe that our use of manufacture and repair manuals is lawful.

Raw Materials and Replacement Parts
We purchase raw materials, primarily consisting of extrusions, forgings, castings, aluminum and titanium sheets and shapes, and stainless steel alloys, from various vendors. We also purchase replacement parts, which are utilized in our various repair and overhaul operations. We believe that the availability of raw materials to us is adequate to support our operations.
Sales, Marketing and Engineering
While each of our operating companies maintains responsibility for selling and marketing its specific products, we have developed two marketing teams at the group level who are focused on cross-selling our broad capabilities. One team supports Integrated Systems and Aerospace Structures and the other team supports Product Support. These teams are responsible for selling systems, integrated assemblies and repair and overhaul services, reaching across our operating companies, to our OEM, military, airline and air cargo customers. In certain limited cases, we use independent, commission-based representatives to serve our customers' changing needs and current trends in some of the markets and geographic regions in which we operate. 
The two group-level marketing teams operate as the front-end of the selling process, establishing or maintaining relationships, identifying opportunities to leverage our brand, and providing service for our customers. Each individual operating company is responsible for its own technical support, pricing, manufacturing, and product support. Also, within Product Support, we have created a group engineering function to provide integrated solutions to meet our customer needs by designing systems that integrate the capabilities of our companies. Also, we are increasingly meeting our customers' needs by designing systems that integrate the extended capabilities of our companies.
A significant portion of our government and defense contracts are awarded on a competitive bidding basis. We generally do not bid or act as the primary contractor but will typically bid and act as a subcontractor on contracts on a fixed-price basis. We generally sell to our other customers on a fixed-price, negotiated contract, or purchase order basis.
When subcontracting, there is a risk of nonperformance by our subcontractors which could lead to disputes regarding quality, cost or impacts to production schedules. Additionally, economic environment changes, including Brexit, trade sanctions, tariffs, and budgetary constraints affecting the prime contractor and our subcontractors may adversely affect their ability to meet or support our performance requirements.
Backlog
We have a number of long-term agreements with several of our customers. These agreements generally describe the terms under which the customer may issue purchase orders to buy our products and services during the term of the agreement. These terms typically include a list of the products or repair services customers may purchase, initial pricing, anticipated quantities and, to the extent known, delivery dates. In tracking and reporting our backlog, however, we only include amounts for which we have actual purchase orders with firm delivery dates or contract requirements generally within the next 24 months, which primarily relate to sales to our OEM customer base. Purchase orders issued by our aftermarket customers are usually completed within a short period of time. As a result, our backlog data relates primarily to the OEM customers. The backlog information set forth below does not include the sales that we expect to generate from long-term agreements for which we do not have actual purchase orders with firm delivery dates.
As of March 31, 2019, we had outstanding purchase orders representing an aggregate invoice price of approximately $3.74 billion, of which $1.45 billion, $2.28 billion and $22 million related to Integrated Systems, Aerospace Structures and Product Support, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, our continuing operations had outstanding purchase orders representing an aggregate invoice price of approximately $4.50 billion, of which $1.34 billion, $3.13 billion and $27 million related to Integrated Systems, Aerospace Structures and Product Support, respectively. Of the existing backlog of $3.74 billion, approximately $1.45 billion will not be shipped by March 31, 2020.
Dependence on Significant Customers
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the Boeing Company ("Boeing") represented approximately 31%, 31% and 35%, respectively, of our net sales, covering virtually every Boeing plant and product. 
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation ("Gulfstream") represented approximately 11%, 13% and 12%, respectively, of our net sales, covering several of Gulfstream's products. 
A significant reduction in sales to Boeing and/or Gulfstream may have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
5

Competition
We compete primarily with Tier 1 and Tier 2 aerostructures manufacturers, systems suppliers and component manufacturers, some of which are divisions or subsidiaries of other large companies, in the manufacture of aircraft structures, systems components, subassemblies and detail parts. 
Competition for the repair and overhaul of aviation components comes from four primary sources, some of whom possess greater financial and other resources than we have: OEMs, major commercial airlines, government support depots, and other independent repair and overhaul companies. Some major commercial airlines continue to own and operate their own service centers, while others have begun to sell or outsource their repair and overhaul services to other aircraft operators or third parties. Large domestic and foreign airlines that provide repair and overhaul services typically provide these services not only for their own aircraft but for other airlines as well. OEMs also maintain service centers which provide repair and overhaul services for the components they manufacture. Many governments maintain aircraft support depots in their military organizations that maintain and repair the aircraft they operate. Other independent service organizations also compete for the repair and overhaul business of other users of aircraft components.
Participants in the aerospace industry compete primarily on the basis of breadth of technical capabilities, quality, turnaround time, capacity and price.
Government Regulation and Industry Oversight
The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States by the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") and in other countries by similar agencies. We must be certified by the FAA and, in some cases, by individual OEMs, in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended, our operations would be adversely affected. New and more stringent government regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future and these new regulations, if enacted, or any industry oversight, if heightened, may have an adverse impact on us.
We must also satisfy the requirements of our customers, including OEMs, that are subject to FAA regulations, and provide these customers with products and repair services that comply with the government regulations applicable to aircraft components used in commercial flight operations. The FAA regulates commercial flight operations and requires that aircraft components meet its stringent standards. In addition, the FAA requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components, and we currently satisfy these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services. Several of our operating locations are FAA-approved repair stations.
Generally, the FAA only grants licenses for the manufacture or repair of a specific aircraft component, rather than the broader licenses that have been granted in the past. The FAA licensing process may be costly and time-consuming. In order to obtain an FAA license, an applicant must satisfy all applicable regulations of the FAA governing repair stations. These regulations require that an applicant have experienced personnel, inspection systems, suitable facilities and equipment. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate a need for the license. Because an applicant must procure manufacturing and repair manuals from third parties relating to each particular aircraft component in order to obtain a license with respect to that component, the application process may involve substantial cost.
The license approval processes for the European Aviation Safety Agency ("EASA"), which regulates this industry in the European Union; the Civil Aviation Administration of China; and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities are similarly stringent, involving potentially lengthy audits. EASA was formed in 2002 and is handling most of the responsibilities of the national aviation authorities in Europe, such as the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority.
Our operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws. For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 ("OSHA"), mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees in the United States. In addition, OSHA provides special procedures and measures for the handling of hazardous and toxic substances. Specific safety standards have been promulgated for workplaces engaged in the treatment, disposal or storage of hazardous waste. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with OSHA's health and safety requirements.

Environmental Matters
Our business, operations and facilities are subject to numerous stringent federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulation by government agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"). Among other matters, these regulatory authorities impose requirements that regulate the emission, discharge, generation, management, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, pollutants and contaminants, govern public and private response actions to hazardous or regulated substances which may be or have been released to the environment, and require us to obtain and maintain licenses and permits in connection with our operations. This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on us. Although management believes that our operations and our facilities are in material compliance with such laws and regulations, future changes in these laws, regulations or interpretations thereof or the nature of our operations or regulatory enforcement actions which may arise, may require us to make significant additional capital expenditures to ensure ongoing compliance or engage in remedial actions.
Certain of our facilities, including facilities acquired and operated by us or one of our subsidiaries have at one time or another been under active investigation for environmental contamination by federal or state agencies when acquired, and at least in some cases, continue to be under investigation or subject to remediation. We are frequently indemnified by prior owners or operators and/or present owners of the facilities for liabilities which we incur as a result of these investigations and the environmental contamination found which pre-dates our acquisition of these facilities, subject to certain limitations. We also maintain a pollution liability policy that provides coverage for certain material liabilities associated with the clean-up of on-site pollution conditions, as well as defense and indemnity for certain third-party suits (including Superfund liabilities at third-party sites), in each case, to the extent not otherwise indemnified. This policy applies to all of our manufacturing and assembly operations worldwide. Also, as we proceed with our plans to exit certain facilities as part of restructuring and related initiatives, the need for remediation for potential environmental contamination could be identified. If we are required to pay the expenses related to environmental liabilities because neither indemnification nor insurance coverage is available, these expenses could have a material adverse effect on us.
Employees
As of March 31, 2019, we employed 10,776 persons, of whom 2,539 were management employees, 74 were sales and marketing personnel, 502 were technical personnel, 383 were administrative personnel and 7,278 were production workers. Our segments were composed of the following employees: Integrated Systems - 2,894 persons, Aerospace Structures - 6,962 persons, Product Support - 751 persons, and Corporate - 169 persons.
Several of our subsidiaries are parties to collective bargaining agreements with labor unions. Under those agreements, we currently employ approximately 2,101 full-time employees. Currently, approximately 19% of our permanent employees are represented by labor unions and approximately 63% of net sales are derived from the facilities at which at least some employees are unionized. Of the 2,101 employees represented by unions, no employees are working under contracts that have expired. 
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, the Stuart, Florida facility production and maintenance employees elected the United Autoworkers of America, Local #2505, to represent them in collective bargaining with the Company.  As of March 31, 2019, the union and the Company were still engaged in initial contract discussions. 
Our inability to negotiate an acceptable contract with any of our labor unions could result in strikes by the affected workers and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and higher ongoing labor costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
