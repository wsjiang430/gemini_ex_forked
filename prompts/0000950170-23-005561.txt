 Item 1. Business
 Organizational Structure and Corporate Information
 Repay Holdings Corporation was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on July 11, 2019 in connection with the closing of a transaction (the “Business Combination”) pursuant to which Thunder Bridge Acquisition Ltd., a special purpose acquisition company organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“Thunder Bridge”), (a) domesticated into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to “Repay Holdings Corporation” and (b) consummated the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary with and into Hawk Parent Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Hawk Parent”).
 Unless otherwise noted or unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we”, “us”, “Repay” and the “Company” and similar references refer (1) before the Business Combination, to Hawk Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries and (2) from and after the Business Combination, to Repay Holdings Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. Unless otherwise noted or unless the context otherwise requires, “Thunder Bridge” refers to Thunder Bridge Acquisition. Ltd. prior to the consummation of the Business Combination.
 We are headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Our legacy business was founded as M & A Ventures, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company doing business as REPAY: Realtime Electronic Payments (“REPAY LLC”), in 2006 by current executives John Morris and Shaler Alias. Hawk Parent was formed in 2016 in connection with the acquisition of a majority interest in the successor entity of REPAY LLC and its subsidiaries by certain investment funds sponsored by, or affiliated with, Corsair Capital LLC (“Corsair”).
Business Overview
 We are a leading payments technology company. We provide integrated payment processing solutions to industry-oriented vertical markets in which businesses have specific and bespoke transaction processing needs. We refer to these markets as “vertical markets” or “verticals.”
 We are a payments innovator, differentiated by our proprietary, integrated payment technology platform and our ability to reduce the complexity of electronic payments for businesses. We intend to continue to strategically target verticals where we believe our ability to tailor payment solutions to our clients’ needs and the embedded nature of our integrated payment solutions will drive strong growth by attracting new clients and fostering long-term client relationships.
 Since a significant portion of our revenue is derived from volume-based payment processing fees, card payment volume is a key operating metric that we use to evaluate our business. We processed approximately $25.6 billion of total card payment volume in 2022. Our year-over-year card payment volume growth was approximately 25% in 2022 and 35% in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 23,000 clients. Our top 10 clients, with an average tenure of approximately seven years, contributed to approximately 15% and 14% of total gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
 Our leading competitive position and differentiated solutions have enabled us to realize unique advantages in fast-growing and strategically-important segments of the payments market. We provide payment processing solutions to clients primarily operating in the personal loans, automotive loans, receivables management, and business-to-business verticals. Our payment processing solutions enable consumers and businesses in these verticals to make payments using electronic payment methods, rather than cash or check, which have historically been the primary methods of payment in these verticals. We believe that a growing number of consumers and businesses prefer the convenience and efficiency of paying with cards and other electronic methods and that we are poised to benefit as these verticals continue to shift from cash and check to electronic payments. The personal loans vertical is predominately characterized by installment loans, which are typically utilized by consumers to finance everyday expenses. The automotive loans vertical predominantly includes subprime automotive loans, automotive title loans and automotive buy-here-pay-here loans and also includes near-prime and prime automotive loans. Our receivables management vertical relates to consumer loan collections, which typically enter the receivables management process due to delinquency on credit card bills or as a result of major life events, such as job loss or major medical issues. The business-to-business vertical relates to transactions occurring between a wide variety of enterprise clients, many of which operate in the automotive, field services, healthcare, homeowner association (“HOA”) management and hospitality industries, as well as educational institutions and governments and municipalities.
 Our go-to-market strategy combines direct sales with integrations with key software providers in our target verticals. The integration of our technology with key software providers in the verticals that we serve, including loan management

systems, dealer management systems (“DMS”), collection management systems, and enterprise resource planning software systems, allows us to embed our omni-channel payment processing technology into our clients’ critical workflow software and ensure seamless operation of our solutions within our clients’ enterprise management systems. We refer to these software providers as our “software integration partners.” An integration allows our sales force to readily access new client opportunities or respond to inbound leads because, in many cases, a business will prefer, or in some cases only consider, a payments provider that has already integrated or is able to integrate its solutions with the business’ primary enterprise management system. We have successfully integrated our technology solutions with numerous, widely-used enterprise management systems in the verticals that we serve, which makes our platform a more compelling choice for the businesses that use them. Moreover, our relationships with our partners help us to develop deep industry knowledge regarding trends in client needs. Our integrated model fosters long-term relationships with our clients, which supports our volume retention rates that we believe are above industry averages. As of December 31, 2022, we maintained approximately 240 integrations with various software providers.
 Segments
Starting from December 31, 2022, we report our financial results based on two reportable segments, Consumer Payments and Business Payments. For additional information on our segments, see Note 16. Segments to our consolidated financial statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Consumer Payments
 Our Consumer Payments segment provides payment processing solutions (including debit and credit card processing, ACH processing and other electronic payment acceptance solutions, as well as our loan disbursement product) that enable our clients to collect payments and disburse funds to consumers and includes our clearing and settlement solutions (“RCS”) and Blue Cow Software business (“BCS”). RCS is our proprietary clearing and settlement platform through which we market customizable payment processing programs to other ISOs and payment facilitators. BCS provides enterprise resource planning software solutions that are customized to propane and fuel oil dealers. The strategic vertical markets served by our Consumer Payments segment primarily include personal loans, automotive loans, receivables management, credit unions, mortgage servicing, consumer healthcare, diversified retail and energy related software services. The BCS business was sold on February 15, 2023. Our Consumer Payments segment represented approximately 85% of our total revenue after any intersegment eliminations for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Business Payments
Our Business Payments segment provides payment processing solutions (including accounts payable automation, debit and credit card processing, virtual credit card processing, Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) processing and other electronic payment acceptance solutions) that enable our clients to collect or send payments to other businesses. The strategic vertical markets served within our Business Payments segment primarily include retail automotive, education, field services, governments and municipalities, healthcare, HOA management and hospitality. Our Business Payments segment represented approximately 15% of our total revenue after any intersegment eliminations for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Growth Strategies
 We intend to drive future growth in the following ways:
 Increase Penetration in Existing Verticals
 We expect to grow meaningfully by continuing to provide innovative payment solutions and client support to our existing clients as well as new clients in the verticals that we currently serve. In addition, our business model allows us to benefit from the growth of our clients and software integration partners. As our clients’ payment volumes and transactions increase, our revenues increase as a result of the fees we charge for processing these payments. Many of the vertical markets in which we compete are continuing to shift from legacy payment mediums — primarily cash and check — to electronic forms of payment. We expect to benefit from this trend as our clients increasingly opt to process payments via the electronic forms of payment in which we specialize.
New Vertical and Geographic Expansion
 We also expect that we will find attractive growth potential in certain verticals in which we currently have limited operations or do not operate. Though we offer highly customized payment solutions to our clients, our core technology platform

is comprehensive and can be utilized to penetrate other strategic vertical markets. Additionally, we envision growing our geographic footprint, as new territories continue to present new business opportunities. For example, we are focused on expanding our Canadian operations, as the demand for our solutions among existing and prospective Canadian clients remains strong.
 Strengthen and Extend Our Solution Portfolio through Continued Innovation.
As we further integrate our solution into our clients’ workflows, we will look to continue to innovate on our solution set and broaden our suite of services. Our acquisition of TriSource Solutions, LLC (“TriSource”) and our continued investment in our technology capabilities position us to provide value-added services that will address the evolving needs of our clients as they seek to best serve their customers. The ability to serve clients across verticals and to be integrated across various software platforms enables us to better understand the needs of clients across verticals and to scale our innovative solutions to a broad segment of the market.
Continue to Drive Operational Efficiencies
 As we continue to grow, we expect to become a more significant partner to our sponsor banks, third party processors and software integration partners, which we expect will give us greater leverage as we expand our contractual relationships with them. We plan to continue to drive operating leverage in our non-technology personnel expenditures, as we believe that, in general we can process larger payment volumes without significant increases to our personnel and operating expenses.
Strategic Acquisitions
 From January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2022, we have successfully acquired eleven businesses. Given the large size and attractive growth trends of our current addressable market, we are primarily focused on growing our business organically. However, we may selectively pursue strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise that meet our internal requirements for the use of capital and return on investment. Some of these opportunities may include those that enable us to acquire new capabilities that may be harder to develop in-house, gain entrance into new segments of the market, enter new markets, or consolidate our existing market.
Solutions
 We provide our clients with comprehensive solutions, which can generally be categorized as follows:
 •Payment Acceptance
 oDebit and Credit Card Processing — Allows our clients to accept card payments. These payments can be made using any of our payment channels, as further described below.
 oACH Processing — Our ACH processing capabilities allow our clients to send and accept traditional and same-day ACH transactions.
 oECash – Through third party relationships, we can facilitate customers who want to make payments with cash by converting it into digital payments that are deposited with our clients.
 oDigital Wallet Services – Enables customers to quickly and easily pay using payment data securely stored in the digital wallets of their mobile devices.
 •Accounts Payable Automation
 oVirtual Credit Card Processing — Our virtual credit card product offering enables our clients to automate their payables transactions by sending single-use virtual credit cards to their suppliers.
 oEnhanced ACH Processing — Provides the same functionality as our standard ACH processing capability, but with the added benefit of incremental transaction and reconciliation data.
 •Clearing and Settlement – Our RCS business offers ISOs and payment facilitators clearing and settlement solutions for all major card brands 
 •Instant Funding — Our instant funding capabilities allow our clients to transfer funds directly to a consumer’s debit or prepaid card. We have created a proprietary process that decreases processing delays typically associated with traditional fund disbursements.


The above payment acceptance and funding methods are processed through our proprietary payment channels:
 •Web-based
 oVirtual Terminal — A terminal that provides virtual payment access for processing of ACH or card transactions.
 oHosted Payment Page — A client-branded terminal that enables ACH and card transaction processing.
 oOnline Client Portal — A consumer-facing, client-specific website that gives a client’s customer the ability to pay online and view account information anywhere, anytime. A Repay hosted website may be stand alone or integrated with any other software application.
 •Mobile Application — We provide clients the ability to accept payments via a mobile application on a customized, white-label basis.
 •Text-to-Pay — Allows a business’ customer to pay with a simple text message after receiving an SMS alert that reminds such customer when payments are due.
 •Interactive Voice Response (“IVR”) — A secure and flexible option to pay over the phone, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, via a 1-800 number with bilingual capabilities.
 •Point of Sale (“POS”) — We provide payment acceptance at brick-and-mortar locations through POS equipment that requires a client’s customer to provide a card.
 Sales and Distribution
 Our sales effort primarily consists of two strategies: first, our direct sales representatives, who focus on each of our core verticals, and second, our software integration partners, which enable the direct salesforce to more effectively access new client opportunities and respond to inbound leads.
Direct Sales Representatives
 Our sales representatives are organized by vertical market and account size. Direct sales representatives work with our clients and software integration partners to understand our clients’ desired payment solutions and then communicate those desires to our product and technology teams, who build a customized suite of products and payment channels tailored to our clients’ specific needs. We also maintain a sales support team that supports the onboarding process.
Software Integration Partners
 As of December 31, 2022, we were integrated with approximately 240 software partners that are providers of our clients’ primary enterprise management systems. Our integrations ensure seamless delivery of our full suite of payment processing capabilities to our clients. These integrations are also a critical part of our marketing strategy, as many clients would prefer to award their payments business to payments processors who have worked to integrate their solutions into the client’s enterprise management systems.
Operations
 We believe that we have developed an effective operations system, including our proprietary onboarding, compliance and client oversight processes, which is structured to enhance the performance of our platform and support our clients.
Client and Transaction Risk Management
 We target clients that we identify as low-risk through the development of underwriting policies and transaction management procedures to manage approval of new accounts and to establish ongoing monitoring of client accounts. Effective risk management aids us in minimizing client losses, such as those relating to chargebacks or similar rejected transactions, and avoiding fraud for the mutual benefit of our clients, our sponsor banks and ourselves.
 Proprietary Compliance Management System. We have developed proprietary onboarding, compliance, and client oversight processes, of which our Compliance Management System (“CMS”) is a part. Our CMS, developed in conjunction

with the Third Party Payment Processors Association, focuses on four main components — board and management oversight, a compliance program with written policies and procedures and employee training and monitoring, responsiveness to consumer complaints and annual compliance audits from an independent third party — and is inclusive of the Electronic Transaction Association guidelines on underwriting and risk.
 Client Onboarding. We believe we maintain rigorous underwriting standards. Prospective clients submit applications to our credit underwriting department, which performs verification and credit-related checks on all applicants. Each client is assigned a risk profile based on sponsor bank requirements, as well as additional criteria specified by us. Our sponsor banks periodically review and approve of our underwriting policies to ensure compliance with applicable law, regulations and payment network rules. Upon approval, the ongoing risk level of a client is monitored and adjusted on a monthly basis based on additional data relating to such client.
 Client Monitoring. Each client’s file is assigned one of three risk levels (low, medium or high) corresponding to several client behaviors. We review and adjust these risk levels on a monthly basis and additionally subject them to more in-depth quarterly reviews. We also engage third parties and rely on internal reporting to identify and monitor credit/fraud risk. We generate client-specific reports that compile daily and historical transactions, which may include average ticket, transaction volume, refund and chargeback levels and authorization history, which we utilize in order to identify suspicious processing activity. We review these reports on a daily basis and suspend any irregular processing activity, which is subject to review, remediation and, as appropriate, suspension of either an individual or batch of transactions or a particular client, as applicable.
 Investigation and Loss Prevention. If a client exceeds the parameters established by our underwriting and/or risk management team or we determine that a client has violated the payment network rules or the terms of its service agreement with us, one of our team members will identify and document the incident. We then review the incident to determine the actions taken or that we can take to reduce our exposure to loss and the exposure of our client to liability. As a part of this process, we may request additional transaction information, withhold or divert funds, verify delivery of merchandise or, in some circumstances, deactivate the client account, include the client on the Network Match List to notify our industry of the client’s behavior or take legal action against the client.
 Collateral. We require some of our clients to establish cash or non-cash collateral reserves, which may include certificates of deposit, letters of credit, rolling merchant reserves or upfront cash. This collateral is utilized in order to offset potential credit or fraud risk liability that we may incur. We attempt to hold such collateral reserves for as long as we are exposed to a loss resulting from a client’s payment processing activity.
 Chargebacks. The payment networks permit the reversal of a money transfer, a chargeback, up to six months (or in rare cases, a longer time frame) after the later of the date the transaction is processed or the delivery of the product or service to the cardholder. If the client incurring the chargeback is unable to fund the refund to the card-issuing bank, we are required to do so by the rules of the payment networks and our contractual arrangements with our sponsor banks. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we believe our chargeback rate was under 1% of our payment volume.
 Security, Disaster Recovery, and Back-up Systems
 We adhere to industry security standards to protect the payment information that we process. We regularly scan and update our network, systems and application code and malware defenses. We use a third party vendor solution for security education materials. Every employee and contractor is required to successfully complete annual security awareness training. We routinely retain external parties to audit our systems’ compliance with current security standards as established by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI DSS”), Service Organization Control ("SOC1 Type II,” “SOC2 Type II”), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) and International Organization for Standardization (“ISO 27001”) and to test our systems against vulnerability to unauthorized access. We utilize third party vendors for internal and external penetration testing. Further, we use one of the most advanced commercially available technologies to encrypt the cardholder numbers and client data that we store in our databases. Additionally, we have a dedicated team responsible for continuous monitoring and security incident response. This team also develops, maintains, tests and verifies our incident response plan. Disaster recovery is built into our primary payment gateway through redundant hardware and software applications hosted in two distinct cloud regions. Our primary cloud region for the payment gateway infrastructure is set up to be replicated, substantially on a real time basis, by our secondary cloud region such that if our primary cloud region becomes impaired or unavailable, operations are redirected to the secondary cloud region. Our incident response team tests these systems each quarter to assess the effectiveness of our disaster recovery plan, including staff readiness and operational capability.
Third Party Processors and Sponsor Banks


We partner with institutions in the payment chain to provide authorization, settlement and funding services in connection with our clients’ transactions. These institutions include third party processors and sponsor banks, who sit between us, acting as the merchant acquirer or payment processor, and the payment networks, such as Visa, MasterCard and Discover. These processors and vendors in turn have agreements with the payment networks, which permit them to route transaction information through their networks in exchange for fees.
 When we facilitate a transaction as a merchant acquirer, we utilize third party processors such as Global Payments, Inc. Under such processing arrangements, the third-party processors and vendors receive processing fees, which are typically based on the number of transactions processed.
In order for us to process and settle transactions for our clients, we have entered into sponsorship agreements with banks that are members of the payment networks. We are required to register with the payment networks through these bank partners because we, as a payment processor, are not a “member bank” as defined by the major payment networks. Our member bank partners sponsor our adherence to the rules and standards of the payment networks and enable us to route transactions under the sponsor banks’ control and identification numbers (for example, known as BIN for Visa and ICA for MasterCard) across the card and ACH networks to authorize and clear transactions. Our relationships with multiple sponsor banks give us the flexibility to shift payment volumes between them, which is designed to help us to secure more competitive pricing for our clients and to maintain redundancy.
 When we facilitate a client’s payment to its suppliers or vendors, we typically utilize the services of third party program managers, such as Wex Inc. and Comdata Inc. (a subsidiary of FleetCor Technologies, Inc.), who have arrangements with banks to operate card issuance programs. Under such arrangements, the program manager and issuing bank retain a portion of the interchange generated by each transaction. Under the applicable contractual arrangements, our clients are generally required to prefund these payments. Because we are not a licensed money transmitter, we have entered into custodial agreements with banks or other financial institutions who will hold our clients’ funds in trust.
 See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business – We rely on other service and technology providers. If such providers fail in or discontinue providing their services or technology to us, our ability to provide services to clients may be interrupted, and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.for further discussion of our arrangements with certain service providers.
 Competitive Conditions and Market Trends
 We compete with a variety of payment processing companies that have different business models, go-to-market strategies and technical capabilities. In our Consumer Payments segment, our primary competitors include ACI Worldwide, Paymentus, PayNearMe, and PayScout. We also compete in our Consumer Payments segment against many traditional merchant acquirers, such as financial institutions, affiliates of financial institutions and payment processing companies in the payment processing industry, including Bank of America Merchant Services, Elavon (a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp), Wells Fargo Merchant Services, Global Payments, WorldPay (a subsidiary of Fidelity National Information Services) and Fiserv. In our Business Payments segment, our primary competitors include AvidXchange, Corporate Spending Innovations (a division of Edenred), Nvoicepay (a division of FleetCor Technologies), Paya and Zelis. We believe the most significant competitive factors in the markets in which we compete are: (1) economics, including fees charged to merchants and commission payouts to software integration partners; (2) product offering, including emerging technologies and development by other participants in the payments ecosystem; (3) service, including product functionality, value-added solutions and strong client support for both clients and software integration partners; and (4) reliability, including a strong reputation for quality service and trusted software integration partners. Our competitors include large and well-established companies, including banks, credit card providers, technology and ecommerce companies and traditional retailers, many of which are larger than we are, have a dominant and secure position in the markets in which they operate or offer other products and services to consumers and clients which we do not offer. Moreover, we compete against all forms of payments, including credit cards, bank transfers, and traditional payment methods, such as cash and check.
 We believe there is a significant digital shift in our industry. Many of the vertical markets in which we compete are continuing to shift from legacy payment mediums — primarily cash and check — to electronic forms of payment. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting changes in consumer behavior has led to an accelerated shift to electronic payments. We expect to benefit from this trend as our clients increasingly opt to process payments via the electronic forms of payment in which we specialize.
 We have experienced in the past, and may continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our volumes and revenues as a result of consumer spending patterns. Volumes and revenues during the first quarter of the calendar year tend to increase

in comparison to the remaining three quarters of the calendar year on a same store basis. This increase is due to consumers’ receipt of tax refunds and the increases in repayment activity levels that follow.
 Acquisitions
 Our historical acquisition activity has allowed us to access new markets, acquire industry talent, broaden our product suite, and supplement organic growth. Our current acquisition strategy focuses on integrated payments companies serving attractive vertical markets and opportunities to broaden our product offerings. From January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2022, we have completed eleven acquisitions, which are described below. These acquisitions were of payment companies and are representative of the acquisitions we envision consummating in the future.
Sigma Acquisition
 Effective as of January 1, 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Sigma Payment Solutions, Inc. (“Sigma”). Sigma was an electronic payment solutions provider to the automotive finance industry. The transaction marked our expansion into the automotive finance space. We have benefited greatly from Sigma’s deep integrations with automotive finance software platforms, or DMS.
PaidSuite Acquisition
 On September 28, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets of PaidSuite, Inc. and PaidMD, LLC (collectively, “PaidSuite”). PaidSuite was an electronic payment solutions provider to the accounts receivable management industry. The transaction accelerated our growth into the accounts receivable management space via client and software integration partner relationships.
Paymaxx Acquisition
 On December 15, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Paymaxx Pro, LLC (“Paymaxx”). The acquisition of Paymaxx has been highly complementary to our earlier acquisition of Sigma and has bolstered our position in the niche automotive finance market. As part of the acquisition, we acquired increased distribution capabilities in the form of an internal sales force and numerous DMS integrations.
TriSource Acquisition
 On August 14, 2019, we acquired all of the equity interests of TriSource. Since 2012, we have used TriSource as one of our primary third-party processors for settlement solutions when we facilitate transactions as a merchant acquirer. The acquisition of TriSource has provided further control over our transaction processing ecosystem and accelerated product delivery capabilities.
APS Acquisition
 On October 14, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets of American Payment Services of Coeur D’Alene, LLC, North American Payment Solutions LLC, and North American Payment Solutions Inc. (collectively, “APS”). The acquisition of APS meaningfully expanded our addressable market by enabling us to access the business-to-business vertical.
Ventanex Acquisition
 On February 10, 2020, we acquired all of the equity interests of CDT Technologies, LTD. d/b/a Ventanex (“Ventanex”). The acquisition of Ventanex accelerated our entry into the healthcare payments vertical.
 cPayPlus Acquisition
 On July 23, 2020, we acquired all of the equity interest of cPayPlus, LLC (“cPayPlus”). The acquisition of cPayPlus further expanded our business-to-business automation and payment offering to include accounts payable automation and payment solutions for both existing and prospective clients across all business lines.
 CPS Acquisition
 On November 2, 2020, we acquired all of the equity interests of CPS Payment Services, LLC, Media Payments, LLC, and Custom Payment Systems, LLC (collectively, “CPS”). The acquisition of CPS enhanced our business-to-business accounts payable automation offerings and introduced our solutions to new verticals including education, government, and media sectors.

BillingTree Acquisition
  On June 15, 2021, we acquired all of the equity interests of BT Intermediate, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “BillingTree”). The acquisition of BillingTree further expanded our position in the healthcare, credit union, and accounts receivable management industries and significantly enhanced our scale and our client diversification.
 Kontrol Acquisition
  On June 22, 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Kontrol LLC (“Kontrol”). The acquisition of Kontrol grew our accounts payable automation business and enabled us to leverage our existing B2B technology infrastructure to increase our virtual card volume.
Payix Acquisition
 On December 29, 2021, we acquired Payix Holdings Incorporated (together with its subsidiary, “Payix”). The acquisition of Payix expanded our position in the large and growing automotive finance market and provided further access to software integrations with leading loan management system and DMS integrations.
Government Regulation
 We operate in an increasingly complex and ever evolving legal and regulatory environment. Our and our clients’ businesses are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as the rules and standards of the payment networks that we utilize to provide our electronic payment services. While in some cases payment processors such as Repay are not directly regulated by governmental agencies, because of the rules and regulations enacted at the state and federal level that affect our clients and sponsor banks, we have developed and continually evaluate and update our compliance models to keep up with the rapid evolution of the legal and regulatory regime our clients and sponsor banks face. We are also subject to legal and regulatory requirements which govern the use, storage and distribution of the information we collect from our clients and cardholders while processing transactions.
 Dodd-Frank Act
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and its related rules and regulations have resulted in significant changes to the regulation of the financial services industry, including the electronic payment industry. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, debit interchange transaction fees that a card issuer receives and are established by a payment card network for an electronic debit transaction are regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Dodd-Frank Act and the Federal Reserve’s implementing regulations require that such interchange fees be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the issuer in processing the transactions. Federal Reserve regulations implementing this “reasonable and proportional” requirement have capped debit interchange rates for card issuers operating in the United States with assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, the regulations contain certain prohibitions on card brand network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions of debit card transactions. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, merchants are also allowed to set minimum dollar amounts (within certain parameters) for the acceptance of a credit card, and they are allowed to provide discounts or incentives to entice consumers to pay with an alternative payment method, such as cash, checks or debit cards.
 The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which has rulemaking authority over consumer protection laws, including the authority to regulate consumer financial products in the United States, including consumer credit, deposit, payment, and similar products. The CFPB may also have authority over us as a provider of services to regulated financial institutions in connection with consumer financial products. Any new rules or regulations implemented by the CFPB, and other similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions, or pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that are applicable to us or our clients’ businesses, or any adverse changes thereto, could increase our cost of doing business or limit our current offerings of integrated payment solutions.
 Privacy and Information Security Regulations
 We provide services that may be subject to various state and federal privacy laws and regulations. Relevant federal privacy laws include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which (along with its implementing regulations) restricts certain collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, requires notice to individuals of privacy practices and provides individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information. These rules also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. Our business may also be subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970,

as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, which regulates the use and reporting of consumer credit information and imposes disclosure requirements on entities who take adverse action based on information obtained from credit reporting agencies. All fifty states have enacted data breach notification laws requiring businesses that experience a security breach of their computer databases that contain personal information to notify affected individuals, consumer reporting agencies and governmental agencies. In addition, there are state laws that restrict the ability to collect and utilize certain types of personal information, such as Social Security and driver’s license numbers, and impose secure disposal requirements for personal data. Certain state laws mandate businesses to implement reasonable data security measures. In addition, various states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia, have recently enacted laws concerning privacy, data protection and information security. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020 and was amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CRPA”), for which most provisions were effective on January 1, 2023, requires companies that process personal information of California residents to make certain disclosures to consumers about data practices, grants consumers specific access rights to their data, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing activities and creates a private right of action for data breaches. The CPRA also establishes a privacy enforcement agency known as the California Privacy Protection Agency. Other states are expected to enact in new similar laws and regulations in the near future.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act & Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act
 HIPAA and its related rules and regulations establish policies and procedures for maintaining the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information (“Protected Health Information”). The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its related rules and regulations extended the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA to “Business Associates” of “Covered Entities” (each as defined by HIPAA).
 Some of our clients are Covered Entities. In providing certain services for our Covered Entity clients, we may receive, maintain, and transmit Protected Health Information on their behalf, and we may be a Business Associate. To the extent we are a Business Associate, we are subject to HIPAA rules and regulations regarding privacy and security of Protected Health Information. In connection with certain services, we may enter into Business Associate Agreements with our Covered Entity clients, requiring compliance with HIPAA rules and regulations, and defining permissible uses and disclosures of Protected Health Information.
 Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Regulation
 Our business is subject to U.S. federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations. We are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by OFAC that prohibit or restrict transactions to or from (or transactions dealing with) narcotics traffickers, terrorists, terrorist organizations, certain individuals, specified countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals. Similar anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified on lists maintained by organizations similar to OFAC in several other countries and which may impose specific data retention obligations or prohibitions on intermediaries in the payment process. We have developed and continue to enhance compliance programs and policies to monitor and address related legal and regulatory requirements and developments.
 Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices
 We and many of our clients are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices and various state laws similar in scope and subject matter thereto. In addition, laws prohibiting these activities and other laws, rules and or regulations, including the Telemarketing Sales Rule, may directly impact the activities of certain of our clients, and in some cases may subject us, as the client’s payment processor or provider of certain services, to investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds if we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal or improper activities of a client through our services. Various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the states attorneys general, have authority to take action against payment processors who violate such laws, rules and regulations. To the extent we are

processing payments or providing services for a client suspected of violating such laws, rules and regulations, we may face enforcement actions and, as a result, incur losses and liabilities that may adversely affect our business.
 In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act gave the CFPB broad authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices” (“UDAAP”) in connection with the provision of consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has extended certain UDAAP-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act to directly apply to payment processors.
 Indirect Regulatory Requirements
 Certain of our clients and our sponsor banks are financial institutions that are directly subject to various regulations and compliance obligations issued by the CFPB, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration and other agencies responsible for regulating financial institutions, which includes state financial institution regulators. While these regulatory requirements and compliance obligations do not apply directly to us, many of these requirements materially affect the services we provide to our clients and us overall. The financial institution regulators have imposed requirements on regulated financial institutions to manage their third-party service providers. Among other things, these requirements include performing appropriate due diligence when selecting third-party service providers; evaluating the risk management, information security, and information management systems of third-party service providers; imposing contractual protections in agreements with third-party service providers (such as performance measures, audit and remediation rights, indemnification, compliance requirements, confidentiality and information security obligations, insurance requirements and limits on liability); and conducting ongoing monitoring, diligence and audit of the performance of third-party service providers. Accommodating these requirements applicable to our clients impose additional costs and risks in connection with our relationships with financial institutions. We expect to expend significant resources on an ongoing basis in an effort to assist our clients in meeting their legal requirements.
 Additionally, our clients, particularly those in the personal loans, automotive loans and receivables management verticals, are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that impose restrictions and requirements on their businesses. For personal lenders and automotive lenders, these laws and regulations could include limitations on interest rates and fees, maximum loan amounts and the number of simultaneous or consecutive loans, imposition of required waiting periods between loans, loan extensions and refinancing, requiring payment schedules (including maximum and minimum loan durations) or repayment plans for borrowers claiming inability to repay loans, mandating disclosures, security for loans, licensing requirements and, in certain jurisdictions, database reporting and loan utilization information. For receivables management companies, these laws and regulations could include laws and regulations (including the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”) and comparable state laws) regarding the time, place and manner of communications with consumers regarding debt collection and prohibitions or limitations on certain debt collection practices. Lastly, some of our clients are subject to various state laws and regulations that prohibit or limit the imposition of a surcharge or convenience fee in connection with their customers use of a payment card or other form of electronic payment.
 Payment Network Rules and Standards
 Payment networks, such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express, establish their own rules and standards that allocate liabilities and responsibilities among the payment networks and their participants. These rules and standards, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, govern a variety of areas, including how consumers and customers may use their cards, whether (and the terms under which) convenience fees or surcharges may be imposed in connection with the use of their cards, the security features of cards, security standards for processing, data security and allocation of liability for certain acts or omissions, including liability in the event of a data breach. The payment networks may change these rules and standards from time to time as they may determine in their sole discretion and with or without advance notice to their participants. These changes may be made for any number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the regulatory environment, to maintain or attract new participants, or to serve the strategic initiatives of the networks, and may impose additional costs and expenses on or be disadvantageous to certain participants. Participants are subject to audit by the payment networks to ensure compliance with applicable rules and standards. The networks may fine, penalize or suspend the registration of participants for certain acts or omissions or the failure of the participants to comply with applicable rules and standards.
 In order for us to process and settle transactions for our clients, we have entered into sponsorship agreements with banks that are members of the payment networks. We are required to register with the payment networks through these bank partners because we, as a payment processor, are not a “member bank” as defined by the major payment networks’ rules and standards governing access to those networks. Our bank partners sponsor our adherence to the rules and standards of the payment networks and enable us to route transactions under the sponsor banks’ control and identification numbers (known as BIN for Visa and ICA for MasterCard) across the card and ACH networks to authorize and clear transactions. Payment network rules restrict us from performing funds settlement and require that merchant settlement funds be in the possession of the member

bank until the merchant is funded. These restrictions place the settlement assets and liabilities under the control of the member bank.
 Our sponsorship agreements give our sponsor banks substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices, including our solicitation, application and qualification procedures for clients and the terms of our agreements with clients, and provide them with the right to audit our compliance with the payment network rules and guidelines. We are also subject to network operating rules and guidelines promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association (“NACHA”) relating to payment transactions we process using the Automated Clearing House Network. Like the payment networks, NACHA may update its operating rules and guidelines at any time, which can require us to take more costly compliance measures or to develop more complex monitoring systems. Similarly, our ACH sponsor banks have the right to audit our compliance with NACHA’s rules and guidelines, and are given wide discretion to approve certain aspects of our business practices and terms of our agreements with ACH clients.
 Other Regulation
 We are subject to U.S. federal and state unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws, which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others we hold that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time, such as account balances that are due to a software integration partner or client following discontinuation of its relationship with us. The Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 requires certain merchant acquiring entities and third-party settlement organizations to provide information returns for each calendar year with respect to payments made in settlement of electronic payment transactions and third-party payment network transactions occurring in that calendar year. Reportable transactions are also subject to backup withholding requirements.
 The foregoing is not an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations to which we are subject and the regulatory framework governing our business is changing continuously. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Intellectual Property
 Certain of our products and services are based on proprietary software and related payment systems solutions. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as employee and third-party non-disclosure, confidentiality, and other contractual arrangements to establish, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights in our technology, including with respect to our proprietary rights related to our products and services. In addition, we license technology from third parties that is integrated into some of our solutions.
 We own a number of registered service marks, including REPAY® and REPAY REALTIME ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS®, and we have other pending applications. We also own a number of domain names, including www.repay.com. For additional information regarding some of the risks relating to our intellectual property see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — We may not be able to successfully manage our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Human Capital
 Our employees are a critical component of our success. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 579 full-time employees throughout the U.S. and Canada. We have 12 office locations in the U.S. and have a remote employee presence in 42 states. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
 We strive to create and maintain a special culture at REPAY that focuses on our values of excellence, passion, integrity, respect, and innovation. Our strong emphasis on culture is intended to empower our employees to make decisions and develop themselves personally and professionally. One of our priorities is to maintain and enhance our culture as we grow in employee size and integrate new team members.
 We participate in an annual employee engagement and feedback survey which allows all full-time employees to anonymously give us feedback on our workplace culture, employee programs, and more. In 2022, 80% of participants responded that REPAY is a great place to work. Our employees’ feedback from the annual surveys have allowed us to be certified as a Great Place to Work® for the last seven consecutive years. We take employee feedback seriously and share the results of the survey, along with an action plan of how we can continue to improve, with all employees.
Attracting, developing, and retaining top talent is a priority at REPAY and we have a dedicated human resources team that focuses on these initiatives. To ensure we stay competitive in the talent market, we strive to make it clear to our employees

that we value and appreciate them, and reward high performance. We foster a culture of rewards and recognition and incentivize our employees with opportunities for growth within the company. New employees are welcomed through our virtual new hire onboarding experience, which consists of at-home equipment, welcome gift packages, an onboarding plan with consistent communication, and human resources orientation, ensures our new hires have the support they need. Additionally, new hire spotlights are socialized in our monthly newsletters to ensure new team members are introduced to the Company and receive a warm welcome and every one of our new employees has the opportunity to meet with our CEO for a “coffee chat” within their first month of employment.
 REPAY’s leadership empowers each team member to make a difference and stretch to their fullest potential. Our dedication to frequent, transparent communication is shown with company-wide meetings where our leaders share Company vision and encourage employees to ask questions. Several departments across the Company hold annual training summits where team members have an opportunity to collaborate with fellow colleagues, participate in department-specific training and further enhance their skillsets. Our compensation strategy gives us competitive advantages by offering competitive salaries, bonus potential and employee ownership opportunities for a meaningful portion of our employees through equity incentive grants.
We recognize the importance of giving back to the communities in which we live. Participating in community outreach initiatives and volunteer opportunities is extremely important to our employees and has become an integral part of our corporate culture. Throughout the year, we provide multiple ways for team members to volunteer and positively impact the surrounding communities.
We value diverse backgrounds, perspectives and experiences, and we are committed to providing an inclusive environment where all individuals are heard and respected. We maintain an Employee Resource Group aimed at connecting and creating a network for women at REPAY. This group meets several times throughout the year to discuss relevant topics and connect with others at the Company. We have also partnered with diverse organizations and higher education programs, to identify a more diverse pool of qualified candidates for recruitment. We continue to evaluate our diversity and inclusion program and are in various phases of implementing several strategic initiatives, which we believe will help us cultivate a more diverse workforce and inclusive environments. Our diversity and inclusion initiatives are periodically reviewed and discussed at the board level.
 We offer a comprehensive benefits package, which goes into effect on a person’s first day of employment, including 100% coverage of employee healthcare premiums and several benefits at no cost to our employees, including life insurance, telehealth, mental health and work-life balance resources. We perform a thorough review of our benefits package annually. Among other benefits, we continue to offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The ESPP is highly valued because it gives our employees the opportunity to become shareholders in REPAY at a discounted price. The financial future of our employees is important to us, which is why we have a generous 401(k)-employer match and performance-based bonus program. To promote personal and professional growth, we encourage our employees to pursue ongoing training and career development opportunities, and we provide tuition assistance and reimbursement for certain pre-approved continuing education programs and professional certifications.

 Risks Related to Our Business
 The payment processing industry is highly competitive. Such competition could adversely affect the fees we receive, and as a result, our margins, business, financial condition and results of operations.
 The market for payment processing services is highly competitive. There are other payment processing service providers that have established a sizable market share in the markets in which we compete and service more clients than we do. Our growth will depend, in part, on a combination of the continued growth of the electronic payment market and our ability to increase our market share.
 Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, management and marketing resources than we have. Accordingly, if these competitors target our business model and, in particular, the vertical markets that we serve, they may be able to offer more attractive fees or payment terms and advances to our clients and more attractive compensation to our software integration partners. They also may be able to offer and provide services and solutions that we do not offer. There are also a large number of small providers of processing services, including emerging technology and non-traditional payment processing companies, that provide various ranges of services to our existing and potential clients. This competition may effectively limit the prices we can charge, cause us to increase the compensation we pay to our software integration partners and require us to control costs aggressively in order to maintain acceptable profit margins.
 Unauthorized disclosure of client or consumer data, whether through breach of our computer systems, computer viruses or otherwise, could expose us to liability and protracted and costly litigation and damage our reputation.
 We are responsible for data security for us and for third parties with whom we partner, including with respect to rules and regulations established by the payment networks, such as Visa, MasterCard and Discover, and debit card networks. These third parties include our clients, software integration partners and other third-party service providers and agents. We and other third parties collect, process, store and/or transmit sensitive data, such as names, addresses, social security numbers, credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates, driver’s license numbers, bank account numbers and protected health information. We have ultimate liability to the payment networks and our sponsor banks that register us with the payment networks for our failure or the failure of other third parties with whom we contract to protect this data in accordance with payment network requirements. The loss, destruction or unauthorized modification of client or consumer data by us or our contracted third parties could result in significant fines, sanctions, proceedings or actions against us by the payment networks, governmental bodies, consumers or others.
 Threats may result from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or from accidental technological failure. For example, certain of our employees have access to sensitive data that could be used to commit identity theft or fraud. Concerns about security increase when we transmit information electronically because such transmissions can be subject to attack, interception or loss. Also, computer viruses can be distributed and spread rapidly over the Internet and could infiltrate our systems or those of our contracted third parties. Denial of service or other attacks could be launched against us for a variety of purposes, including interfering with our services or to create a diversion for other malicious activities. These types of actions and attacks and others could disrupt our delivery of services or make them unavailable.
 We and our contracted third parties could be subject to breaches of security by hackers. Our encryption of data and other protective measures may not prevent unauthorized access to or use of sensitive data. A systems breach may subject us to material losses or liability, including payment network fines, assessments and claims for unauthorized purchases with misappropriated credit, debit or card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims. A misuse of such data or a cybersecurity breach (including a ransomware attack) could harm our reputation and deter clients from using electronic payments generally and our services specifically, thus reducing our revenue. In addition, any such misuse or breach could cause us to incur costs to correct the breaches or failures, expose us to uninsured liability, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, subject us to lawsuits and result in the imposition of material penalties and fines under state and federal laws or by the payment networks or limitations on our ability to process payment transactions on such payment networks. While we maintain cyber insurance coverage (which, in certain cases, is required pursuant to certain of our contractual commitments) that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of these risks, our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses. Additionally, we may be required to increase our cyber insurance coverage pursuant to our contractual commitments entered into in the future. Our cyber insurance costs have increased significantly following well-publicized ransomware attacks involving other organizations. The costs to maintain or increase our cyber insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Any human error, fraud, malice, accidental technological failure or attacks against us or our contracted third parties could hurt our reputation, force us to incur significant expenses in remediating the resulting impacts, expose us to uninsured liability, result in the loss of our sponsor bank relationships or our ability to participate in the payment networks, subject us to

lawsuits, fines or sanctions, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business and/or materially impede our ability to conduct business.
 Although we generally require that our agreements with our software integration partners or service providers include confidentiality obligations that restrict these parties from using or disclosing any client or consumer data except as necessary to perform their services under the applicable agreements, we cannot guarantee that these contractual measures will prevent the unauthorized use, modification, destruction or disclosure of data or allow us to seek reimbursement from the contracted party. In addition, many of our clients are small and medium-sized businesses that may have limited competency regarding data security and handling requirements and may thus experience data breaches. Any unauthorized use, modification, destruction or disclosure of data could result in protracted and costly litigation and the incurrence of significant losses by us.
 In addition, our agreements with our sponsor banks and our third-party payment processors (as well as payment network requirements) require us to take certain protective measures to ensure the confidentiality of client and consumer data. Any failure to adequately comply with these protective measures could result in fees, penalties, litigation or termination of our sponsor bank agreements.
 Security breaches may be subject to scrutiny from governmental agencies such as the CFPB, the FTC and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights. See “Risks Related to Regulation” below.
 If we cannot keep pace with rapid developments and changes in our industry, the use of our products and services could decline, causing a reduction in our revenues.
 The electronic payments market is subject to constant and significant changes. This market is characterized by rapid technological evolution, new product and service introductions, evolving industry standards, changing client needs and the entrance of new competitors, including products and services that enable card networks and banks to transact with consumers directly. To remain competitive, we continually pursue initiatives to develop new products and services to compete with these new market entrants. These projects carry risks, such as difficulty in determining market demand and timing for delivery, cost overruns, delays in delivery, performance problems and lack of client acceptance, and some projects may require investment in non-revenue generating products or services that our software integration partners and clients expect to be included in our offerings. In addition, new products and offerings may not perform as intended or generate the business or revenue growth expected.
 The continued growth and development of our payment processing services and solutions will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer and business behavior. Any failure to timely integrate emerging payment methods into our software, to anticipate consumer or business behavior changes or to contract with processing partners that support such emerging payment technologies could cause us to lose traction among our clients or referral sources, including industry associations, resulting in a corresponding loss of revenue, if those methods become popular among end-users of their services.
 Our products and services are designed to process complex transactions and provide reports and other information on those transactions, all at very high volumes and processing speeds. Our technology offerings must also integrate with a variety of network, hardware, mobile and software platforms and technologies, and we need to continuously modify and enhance our products and services to adapt to changes and innovation in these technologies. Any failure to deliver an effective, reliable and secure service or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses. If we do not deliver a promised new product or service to our clients or software integration partners in a timely manner or the product or service does not perform as anticipated, our development efforts could result in increased costs and a loss in business, reducing our earnings and causing a loss of revenue. We also rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to, or production of, new technologies, including software and hardware. For example, we rely on our software integration partners to integrate our services and products into the software platforms being used by our clients. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we are unable to develop, adapt to or access technological changes or evolving industry standards on a timely and cost-effective basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
 If our vertical markets do not increase their acceptance of electronic payments or if there are adverse developments in the electronic payment industry in general, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
 The vertical markets we primarily serve have not historically utilized electronic payments to the same extent as traditional markets such as retail and travel. If consumers and businesses in our primary vertical markets do not increase their

use of cards as payment methods for their transactions or if the mix of payment methods changes in a way that is adverse to us, such developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory changes may also result in our clients seeking to charge their own clients additional fees for use of credit or debit cards which may result in such clients using other payment methods. Additionally, in recent years, increased incidents of security breaches have caused some consumers to lose confidence in the ability of businesses to protect their information, causing certain consumers to discontinue use of electronic payment methods. Security breaches could result in financial institutions canceling large numbers of credit and debit cards, or consumers or businesses electing to cancel their cards following such incidents.
 Potential clients or software integration partners may be reluctant to switch to, or develop a relationship with, a new payment processor, which may adversely affect our growth.
 Many potential clients and software integration partners worry about potential disadvantages associated with switching payment processing providers, such as a loss of accustomed functionality, increased costs and business disruption. There can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential reluctance to change payment processing providers or to initiate a relationship with us will be successful, and this resistance may adversely affect our growth and our business overall.
If we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of payment networks and industry self-regulatory organizations, those payment networks or organizations could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations through our sponsor banks.
 We rely on sponsor banks and, in certain cases, third-party processors to access the payment card networks, such as Visa, MasterCard and Discover, that enable our ability to offer to our clients the acceptance of credit cards and debit cards, and we must pay fees for such services. To provide our merchant acquiring services, we are registered through our sponsor banks with the Visa, MasterCard and Discover networks as a service provider for member institutions. As such, we, our sponsor banks and many of our clients are subject to complex and evolving payment network rules. The payment networks routinely update and modify requirements applicable to merchant acquirers, including rules regulating data integrity, third-party relationships (such as those with respect to sponsor banks and independent sales organization (“ISOs”)), merchant chargeback standards and PCI DSS. The rules of the card networks are set by their boards, which may be influenced by card issuers, some of which offer competing transaction processing services. Any changes in payment network rules or standards may be imposed on highly compressed timelines and may have a negative impact on our results of operations.
 If we or our sponsor banks fail to comply with the applicable rules and requirements of any of the payment networks, such payment network could suspend or terminate our registration. Further, our transaction processing capabilities, including with respect to settlement processes, could be delayed or otherwise disrupted, and recurring non-compliance could result in the payment networks seeking to fine us or suspend or terminate our registrations that allow us to process transactions on their networks, which would make it impossible for us to conduct our business on its current scale.
 Under certain circumstances specified in the payment network rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments or other assessments with regard to our compliance with the PCI DSS. Such audits or assessments may reveal that we have failed to comply with the PCI DSS. In addition, even if we comply with the PCI DSS, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. The termination of our registrations with the payment networks, or any changes in payment network or issuer rules that limit our ability to provide merchant acquiring services, could have an adverse effect on our payment processing volumes, revenues and operating costs. If we are unable to comply with the requirements applicable to our payment processing activities, the payment networks could no longer allow us to provide these solutions, which would render us unable to conduct our business. If we were precluded from processing Visa and MasterCard electronic payments, we would lose a substantial portion of our revenues.
 We are also subject to the operating rules of the NACHA. NACHA is a self-regulatory organization which administers and facilitates private-sector operating rules for ACH payments and defines the roles and responsibilities of financial institutions and other ACH network participants. The NACHA Rules and Operating Guidelines impose obligations on us and our partner financial institutions. These obligations include audit and oversight by the financial institutions and the imposition of mandatory corrective action, including termination, for serious violations. If an audit or self-assessment under PCI DSS or NACHA identifies any deficiencies that we need to remediate, the remediation efforts may distract our management team and be expensive and time consuming.
 We rely on sponsor banks in order to process electronic payment transactions, and such sponsor banks have substantial discretion with respect to certain elements of our business practices. If these sponsorships are terminated and we are not able to secure new sponsor banks, we will not be able to conduct our business.


 Because we are not a bank, we are not eligible for membership in the Visa, MasterCard and other payment networks, and are, therefore, unable to directly access these payment networks, which are required to process transactions. We are currently registered with payment networks through our sponsor banks.
If these sponsorships are terminated and we are unable to secure a replacement sponsor bank within the applicable wind down period, we will not be able to process electronic payment transactions. While we maintain relationships with multiple sponsor banks for flexibility in the processing of payment volume and in the pricing of our clients’ solutions, the loss of or termination of a relationship with a sponsor bank or a significant decrease in the amount of payment volume that a sponsor bank processes for us could reduce such flexibility and negatively affect our business. To the extent the number of our sponsor banks decreases, we will become increasingly reliant on our remaining sponsor banks, which would materially adversely affect our business should our relationship with any of such remaining banks be terminated or otherwise disrupted. Furthermore, our agreements with our sponsor banks provide the sponsor banks with substantial discretion in approving certain elements of our business practices, including our solicitation, application and underwriting procedures for clients. Our sponsor banks’ actions under these agreements could be detrimental to us.
 To acquire and retain clients, we depend on our software integration partners that integrate our services and solutions into software used by our clients.
 We rely heavily on the efforts of our software integration partners to ensure our services and solutions are properly integrated into the software that our clients use. Generally, our agreements with software integration partners are not exclusive and these partners retain the right to refer potential clients to other payment processors. In addition, our agreements with software integration partners do not generally prohibit these partners from providing payment processing solutions to clients (including by acquiring a competing payment processing business).
 We may need to provide financial concessions to maintain relationships with current software integration partners or to attract potential software integration partners from our competitors. We have been required, and expect to be required in the future, to make concessions when renewing contracts with our software integration partners, and such concessions can have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance.
 If our software integration partners focus more heavily on working with other payment processors, acquire or develop their own payment processing capabilities, cease operations or become insolvent, we may be at risk of losing existing clients with whom these software integration partners have relationships. If we are unable to maintain our existing base of software integration partners or develop relationships with new software integration partners, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. In addition, our efforts to form relationships with new software integration partners may be hindered to the extent they perceive that integrating with a new payment processor or switching to us from another payment processor is too costly or time-consuming. Many software providers choose to integrate with only a small number of payments processors due to the requisite time and cost of integrating their systems with a payment processor’s solutions.
 Failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud could increase our chargeback liability and other liability.
 We are potentially liable for losses caused by fraudulent card transactions or business fraud. Card fraud occurs when a merchant’s customer uses a stolen card (or a stolen card number in a card-not-present transaction) to purchase merchandise or services. In a traditional card-present transaction, if the merchant swipes the card, receives authorization for the transaction from the card issuing bank and verifies the signature on the back of the card against the paper receipt signed by its customer, the card issuing bank remains liable for any loss. In a fraudulent card-not-present transaction, even if the merchant receives authorization for the transaction, the merchant may be liable for any loss arising from the transaction. In addition, consumers may dispute repayments on a loan by claiming it was unlawful under applicable law.
 Business fraud occurs when a business or organization, rather than a cardholder, opens a fraudulent merchant account and conducts fraudulent transactions or when a business, rather than a consumer (though sometimes working together with a consumer engaged in fraudulent activities), knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit card or card number to record a false sales transaction, intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction, or provides services in violation of applicable law. Business fraud also occurs when employees of businesses change the business demand deposit accounts to their personal bank account numbers, so that payments are improperly credited to the employee’s personal account.
 Certain of these types of fraud present potential liability for chargebacks associated with our clients’ processing transactions. If a billing dispute between a client and a consumer is not ultimately resolved in favor of our client, the disputed transaction is “charged back” to the client’s bank and credited to the consumer’s bank. Anytime our client is unable to satisfy a chargeback, we are responsible for that chargeback. We have a number of contractual protections and other means of recourse

to mitigate those risks, including collateral or reserve accounts that we may require our clients to maintain for these types of contingencies. Nonetheless, if we are unable to collect the chargeback from the clients’ account or reserve account (if applicable), or if the client refuses or is financially unable due to bankruptcy or other reasons to reimburse us for the chargeback, we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder’s bank. We have established systems and procedures to detect and reduce the impact of business fraud, but these measures may not be effective, and incidents of fraud could increase in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we believe our chargeback rate was less than 1% of payment volume. Any increase in chargebacks not paid by our clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Our processes to reduce fraud losses depend in part on our ability to restrict the deposit of processing funds while we investigate suspicious transactions. We could be sued by parties alleging that our restriction and investigation processes violate federal and state laws on consumer protection, unfair business practices or other applicable laws. If we are unable to defend any such claim successfully, we could be required to restructure our anti-fraud processes in ways that would harm our business or pay substantial fines.
 As part of our program to reduce fraud losses, we may temporarily restrict the ability of clients to access certain processing deposits if those transactions or their account activity are identified by our anti-fraud models as suspicious. We could be sued by parties alleging that our restriction and investigation processes violate federal and state laws on consumer protection or unfair business practices. If we are unable to defend any such claim successfully, we could be required to restructure our anti-fraud processes in ways that could harm our business and to pay substantial fines. Even if we are able to defend a claim successfully, the litigation could damage our reputation, consume substantial amounts of our management’s time and attention, and require us to change our client service and operations in ways that could increase our costs and decrease the effectiveness of our anti-fraud program. In addition, if a client has filed for bankruptcy protection, then our normal processes may be limited by applicable bankruptcy laws.
We receive savings related to favorable pricing or incentives on certain interchange and other payment network fees. To the extent we cannot maintain such savings and cannot pass along any corresponding increases in such fees to our clients, our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
 We bear interchange, assessment, transaction and other fees set by the payment networks to the card issuing banks and the payment networks for each transaction we process as a merchant acquirer. Under certain circumstances, the payment networks afford us preferential rates or incentives with respect to such fees, which helps us to control our operating costs. From time to time, the payment networks increase the interchange fees and other fees that they charge payment processors and the sponsor banks. At their sole discretion, our sponsor banks have the right to pass any increases in interchange and other fees on to us, and they have consistently done so in the past. We are generally permitted under the contracts into which we enter with our clients, and in the past have been able to, pass these fee increases along to our clients through corresponding increases in our processing fees. However, if we are unable to pass through these and other fees in the future (which could be the result of the structure of “flat rate” or convenience fee pricing under certain contracts), or if the payment networks decline to offer us preferential rates or incentives on such fees as compared to those charged to other payment processors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Our systems and those of our third-party providers may fail due to factors beyond our control, which could interrupt our service, resulting in our inability to process payments or provide ancillary services, loss of business, increase in costs and exposure to liability.
 We depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of numerous systems, including our computer network systems, software, data centers and telecommunication networks, as well as the systems and services of our sponsor banks, the payment networks, third-party providers of processing services and other third parties. Our systems and operations, or those of our third-party providers, such as our provider of dial-up authorization services, or the payment networks themselves, could be exposed to damage or interruption from, among other things, hardware and software defects or malfunctions, telecommunications failure, computer denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, unauthorized entry, computer viruses or other malware, human error, natural disaster, power loss, acts of terrorism or sabotage, financial insolvency of such providers and similar events. These threats, and errors or delays in the processing of payment transactions, system outages or other difficulties, could result in failure to process transactions or provide ancillary services, additional operating and development costs, diversion of technical and other resources, loss of revenue, clients and software integration partners, loss of client and cardholder data, harm to our business or reputation, exposure to fraud losses or other liabilities and fines and other sanctions imposed by payment networks. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur.


At present, our critical operational systems, such as our payment gateway, are fully redundant, while certain of our less critical systems are not. Therefore, certain aspects of our operations may be subject to interruption. Also, while we have disaster recovery policies and arrangements in place, they have not been tested under actual disasters or similar events. Maintaining and upgrading our system is costly and time-consuming, involves significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products, and there can be no assurances that such systems will be effective. Frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices.
 In addition, we are continually improving and upgrading our information systems and technologies. Implementation of new systems and technologies is complex, expensive and time-consuming. If we fail to timely and successfully implement new information systems and technologies or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies, or if such systems and technologies do not operate as intended, this could have an adverse impact on our business, internal controls (including internal controls over financial reporting), results of operations and financial condition.
 We rely on other service and technology providers. If such providers fail in or discontinue providing their services or technology to us, our ability to provide services to clients may be interrupted, and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
 We rely on third parties to provide or supplement card processing services and for infrastructure hosting services. We also rely on third parties for specific software and hardware used in providing our products and services. The termination by our service or technology providers of their arrangements with us or their failure to perform their services efficiently and effectively may adversely affect our relationships with our clients and, if we cannot find alternate providers quickly, may cause those clients to terminate their relationships with us.
 Our third-party processors and third-party program managers, which provide us with front-end authorization services, card issuance program services and certain other services, compete with us or may compete with us in the future in the vertical markets that we serve. There can be no assurance that these processors will maintain their relationships with us in the future or that they will refrain from competing directly with the solutions that we offer.
If we are unable to renew our existing contracts with our most significant vendors, we might not be able to replace the related products or services at the same cost, which would negatively impact our profitability. Additionally, while we believe we would be able to locate alternative vendors to provide substantially similar services at comparable rates, or otherwise replicate such services internally, no assurance can be made that a change would not be disruptive to our business, which could potentially lead to a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability until resolved.
 We also rely in part on third parties for the development of and access to new technologies, and updates to existing products and services for which third parties provide ongoing support, which reliance increases the cost associated with new and existing product and service offerings. Failure by these third-party providers to devote an appropriate level of attention to our products and services could result in delays in introducing new products or services, or delays in resolving any issues with existing products or services for which third-party providers provide ongoing support.
 The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 The COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation efforts by governments and other parties to attempt to control the spread of the virus (including its variants) have adversely impacted the U.S. and global economy, leading to significant changes in consumer and business spending and economic activity and disruptions and volatility in the U.S. and global capital markets. We are diligently working to ensure that we can continue to operate with minimal disruption, mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our employees’ health and safety and address potential business interruptions on ourselves and our clients. However, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in these efforts.
 Although we have experienced increased demand for some of our service offerings as a result of an accelerated shift to electronic payments, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic, the mitigation efforts and the resulting economic impact have had, and may continue to have, an overall adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The actual further effect in any given future period is difficult to estimate, and it will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including: the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak (including whether there are continued variants or other waves of infection); the nature, extent and effectiveness of mitigation measures; the administration of vaccines and the availability of therapeutic treatments; the extent and duration of the effect on the economy, unemployment, consumer confidence and consumer and business spending; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.

The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mitigation efforts and the resulting economic impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition have included and may continue to include the following with respect to the key industry-oriented “vertical” markets that we serve:
 •A decrease in the origination of personal or automotive loans and a decrease in payments as a result of changes in consumer behavior following receipt of government stimulus, tax credits or extra unemployment benefits.
 •A decrease in the amount of business-to-business payments as a result of the overall economic slowdown and reduction in business spending.
 The above effects have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in an adverse impact on the amount of fees we can earn for processing payments and other transactions on behalf of our clients. There may be a delay in the timing of when our business is impacted by these matters. As an example, we earned incremental fees from processing loan payments or payoffs that result from consumers’ receipt of additional government stimulus or extra unemployment benefits, but our business, results of operations and financial condition in subsequent periods were and could continue to be adversely affected from reduced loan originations as result of such combination of government action and consumer behavior.
 To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic, the mitigation efforts and the resulting economic impact continues to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, such matters may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors disclosed herein, such as those relating to our responsibility for the prevention of unauthorized disclosure of consumer data and our ability to minimize losses relating to chargebacks, fraud and similar losses.
 We are subject to economic and political risk, the business cycles of our clients and software integration partners and the overall level of consumer and commercial spending, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 The electronic payment industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer and commercial spending. We are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence, consumer spending, consumer discretionary income and changes in consumer purchasing habits, including natural disasters and health emergencies, including earthquakes, fires, power outages, typhoons, floods, pandemics or epidemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and manmade events such as civil unrest, labor disruption, international trade disputes, international conflicts, terrorism, wars and critical infrastructure attacks. A sustained deterioration in general economic conditions, particularly in the United States, continued uncertainty for an extended period of time, due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, persistent inflation or further increases in interest rates, could adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or aggregate volume of transactions made using electronic payments. Our consumer finance and mortgage clients may be disproportionately impacted by further increased interest rates or a general economic downturn, which could result in a decrease to our revenue and profits. If our consumer finance or mortgage clients make fewer or smaller loans (or their borrowers fail to make required payments), or consumers and businesses spend less money through electronic payments, we will have fewer transactions to process at lower dollar amounts, resulting in lower revenue. Smaller tax refunds to consumers, due to the absence of additional stimulus or similar impacts or otherwise, could also negatively impact our results of operations.
 The U.S. and international markets are experiencing uncertain and volatile economic conditions, including from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, sustained inflation, recession concerns and supply chain disruptions. These conditions make it extremely difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Together, these circumstances create an environment in which it is challenging for us to predict future operating results. If these uncertain business, macroeconomic or political conditions continue or further decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.


Our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risks associated with providing payment processing solutions.
 We operate in a rapidly changing industry. Accordingly, our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective to identify, monitor, manage and remediate our risks associated with providing payment processing solutions. Some of our risk evaluation methods depend upon information provided by others and public information regarding markets, clients or other matters that are otherwise inaccessible by us. In some cases, that information may not be accurate, complete or up-to-date. Additionally, our risk detection system is subject to a high degree of “false positive” risks being detected, which makes it difficult for us to identify real risks in a timely manner. If our policies and procedures are not fully effective or we are not always successful in capturing all risks to which we are or may be exposed, we may suffer harm to our reputation or be subject to litigation or regulatory actions that materially increase our costs and limit our ability to grow and may cause us to lose existing clients.
 We may not be able to continue to expand our share in our existing vertical markets or continue to expand into new vertical markets, which would inhibit our ability to grow and increase our profitability.
 Our future growth and profitability depend, in part, upon our continued expansion within the vertical markets in which we currently operate, the emergence of other vertical markets for electronic payments and our integrated solutions, and our ability to penetrate new vertical markets and our current software integration partners’ client bases. As part of our strategy to expand into new vertical markets and increase our share in our existing vertical markets, we look for acquisition opportunities and partnerships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration, technological capabilities, product offerings and distribution capabilities. We may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition or partnership candidates in the future, and if we do identify them, they may not provide us with the benefits we anticipated. In addition, our ability to continue to grow and profitably service clients in Canada is uncertain and will require additional resources and controls, and we may encounter unanticipated challenges.
 Our expansion into new vertical markets also depends on our ability to adapt our existing technology or to develop new technologies to meet the particular needs of each new vertical market. We may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop effective and secure services or distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new vertical markets. Penetrating these new vertical markets may also prove to be more challenging or costly or may take longer than we may anticipate. If we fail to expand into new vertical markets and increase our penetration into existing vertical markets, we may not be able to continue to grow our revenues and earnings.
 We may not be able to successfully manage our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.
 We rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary technology, which is critical to our success, particularly in our strategic verticals where we may offer proprietary software solutions to our clients. Third parties have, and in the future may, challenge, circumvent, infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property, or such intellectual property may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of service offerings or other competitive harm. Other parties, including our competitors, may independently develop similar technology and duplicate our services or design around our intellectual property and, in such cases, we may not be able to assert our intellectual property rights against such parties. Further, our contractual arrangements may be subject to termination or renegotiation with unfavorable terms to us, and our third-party licensors may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and other adverse business dynamics, any of which might affect our ability to use and exploit the products licensed to us by such third-party licensors. Additionally, our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information. We may have to litigate to enforce or determine the scope and enforceability of our intellectual property rights and know-how, which is expensive, could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove successful. Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change in our industry, aspects of our business and our services rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or retain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to license or otherwise use third-party intellectual property could harm our business and ability to compete.
We may also be subject to costly litigation if our services and technology are alleged to infringe upon or otherwise violate a third party’s proprietary rights. Third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our products, services or technology. Any of these third parties could make a claim of infringement, breach or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights against us with respect to our products, services or technology. Any claim from third parties may result in a limitation on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims. Additionally, in recent

years, individuals and groups have been purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement or other violations and attempting to extract settlements from companies like us. Even if we believe that intellectual property related claims are without merit, defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of time and attention of our management and employees. Claims of intellectual property infringement or violation also may require us to redesign affected products or services, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products or services. Even if we have an agreement for indemnification against such costs, the indemnifying party, if any in such circumstance, may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.
 The loss of key personnel or the loss of our ability to attract, recruit, retain and develop qualified employees, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 We depend on the ability and experience of a number of our key personnel who have substantial experience with our operations, the rapidly changing payment processing industry and the vertical markets in which we offer our products and services. Many of our key personnel have worked for us for a significant amount of time or were recruited by us specifically due to their experience. Our success depends in part upon the reputation and influence within the industry of our senior managers who have, over the years, developed long standing and favorable relationships with our software integration partners, vendors, card associations, sponsor banks and other payment processing and service providers. We experienced senior management turnover in 2022 as a result of the departures of our chief operating officer and our chief revenue officer. It is possible that the loss of the services of these executives or other senior executives or key managers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, contractual obligations related to confidentiality assignment of intellectual property rights, non-solicitation and non-competition may be ineffective or unenforceable, and departing employees may share our proprietary information with competitors or seek to solicit our software integration partners or clients or recruit our key personnel to competing businesses in ways that could adversely impact us.
 Further, in order for us to continue to successfully compete and grow, we must attract, recruit, develop and retain personnel who will provide us with the expertise we need. Our success also depends on the skill and experience of our sales force, which we must continuously work to maintain. While we have a number of key personnel who have substantial experience with our operations, we must also develop our personnel so that our personnel are capable of maintaining the continuity of our operations, supporting the development of new services and solutions and expanding our client base. The market for qualified personnel is highly competitive, and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. Our efforts to retain and develop personnel may also result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability.
 We have been the subject of various claims and legal proceedings and may become the subject of claims, litigation or investigations which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of various claims and legal proceedings and may become the subject of claims, litigation or investigations, including commercial disputes and employee claims, such as claims of age discrimination, sexual harassment, gender discrimination, immigration violations or other local, state and federal labor law violations, and from time to time may be involved in governmental or regulatory investigations or similar matters arising out of our current or future business. Any claims asserted against us or our management, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our relationships with our clients, software integration partners and other third parties and could lead to additional related claims. In light of the potential cost and uncertainty involved in litigation, we have in the past and may in the future settle matters even when we believe we have a meritorious defense. Certain claims may seek injunctive relief, which could disrupt the ordinary conduct of our business and operations or increase our costs of doing business. Our insurance or indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending pending or future litigation or similar matters under various laws. Any judgments or settlements in any pending or future claims, litigation or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 We may not be able to successfully execute our strategy of growth through acquisitions.
 A significant part of our growth strategy is to enter into new vertical markets through platform acquisitions of vertically-focused integrated payment and software solutions providers, to expand within our existing vertical markets through selective tuck-in acquisitions and to otherwise increase our presence in the payments processing market.
 Although we expect to continue to execute our acquisition strategy:


•we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or acquire additional assets on favorable terms;
 •we may compete with others to acquire assets, which competition may increase, and any level of competition could result in decreased availability or increased prices for acquisition candidates;
 •competing bidders for such acquisitions may be larger, better-funded organizations with more resources and easier access to capital;
 •we may experience difficulty in anticipating the timing and availability of acquisition candidates;
 •we may not be able to obtain the necessary financing, on favorable terms or at all, to finance any of our potential acquisitions;
 •potential acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approvals, which may cause delays and uncertainties; and
 •we may not be able to generate cash necessary to execute our acquisition strategy.
 The occurrence of any of these factors could adversely affect our growth strategy.
 Our acquisitions subject us to a variety of risks that could harm our business and the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions may not be realized on the expected timeline or at all.
 We may experience various challenges associated with our acquired businesses, such as:
 •we may need to allocate substantial operational, financial and management resources in integrating new businesses, technologies and products, and management may encounter difficulties in integrating the operations, personnel or systems of the acquired business;
 •the acquisition may have a material adverse effect on our business relationships with existing or future clients or software integration partners;
 •we may assume substantial actual or contingent liabilities, known and unknown;
 •the acquisition may not meet our expectations of future financial performance on our expected timeline or at all;
 •we may experience delays or reductions in realizing expected synergies or benefits;
 •we may incur substantial unanticipated costs or encounter other problems associated with the acquired business, including challenges associated with transfer of various data processing functions and connections to our systems and those of our third-party service providers;
 •we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges;
 •we may be unable to achieve our intended objectives for the transaction; and
 •we may not be able to retain the key personnel, clients and suppliers of the acquired business.
 These challenges and costs and expenses may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Risks Related to Regulation
 We and our clients are subject to extensive government regulation, and any new laws and regulations, industry standards or revisions made to existing laws, regulations or industry standards affecting our business, our clients’ businesses or the electronic payments industry, or our or our clients’ actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations, may have an unfavorable impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 We and the clients we serve are subject to numerous federal and state regulations that affect the electronic payments industry. Regulation of our industry has increased significantly in recent years and is constantly evolving. Changes to statutes, regulations or industry standards, including interpretation and implementation of statutes, regulations or standards, could

increase our cost of doing business or affect the competitive balance. Failure to comply with regulations may have an adverse effect on our business, including the limitation, suspension or termination of services provided to, or by, third parties, and the imposition of penalties or fines. To the extent these regulations negatively impact the business, operations or financial condition of our clients, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because, among other matters, our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us, could decide to avoid or abandon certain lines of business, or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions. We could be required to invest a significant amount of time and resources to comply with additional regulations or oversight or to modify the manner in which we contract with or provide products and services to our clients; and those regulations could directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services. We may not be able to update our existing products and services, or develop new ones, to satisfy our client’ needs. Any of these events, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 Interchange fees, which are typically paid to the card issuer in connection with credit and debit card transactions, are subject to increasingly intense legal, regulatory and legislative scrutiny. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the U.S. financial regulatory system by regulating and limiting debit card fees charged by certain issuers, allowing merchants to set minimum dollar amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and allowing merchants to offer discounts or other incentives for different payment methods. These regulations (as well as any related modifications or changes in interpretation) could negatively affect the number of debit transactions, and prices charged per transaction, which would negatively affect our business.
 Many of our clients desire to impose a convenience fee or a surcharge in connection with their customers’ use of a credit or debit card or other form of electronic payment. Various state laws and regulations impose prohibitions or other limitations on those types of fees or charges, and interpretation of those state laws and regulations is constantly evolving. State laws and regulations (as well as any related modifications or changes in interpretation in the payment network rules related to those fees and costs) could negatively the willingness of some of our clients to accept credit or debit card or other electronic payment or result in less favorable terms to us in exchange for our clients to absorb those fees and costs, all of which would negatively affect our business.
 Laws and regulations, even if not directed at us, may require us to take significant efforts to change our services and solutions and may require that we incur additional compliance costs and change how we price our products and services to our clients and software integration partners. Implementing new compliance efforts is difficult because of the complexity of new regulatory requirements, and we are devoting and will continue to devote significant resources to ensure compliance. Furthermore, regulatory actions may precipitate changes in business practices by us and other industry participants which could affect how we market, price and distribute our products and services, and which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulations or evolving public perceptions of our business could damage our business or our reputation.
 Depending on how our products and services evolve, we may be subject to a variety of additional laws and regulations, including those governing money transmission, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, restrictions on foreign assets, gambling, banking and lending, and import and export restrictions.
 Our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. In addition, to the extent we decide to offer our products and services in additional jurisdictions (for example, our expansion into Canada), we may incur additional compliance-related costs with respect to operating in such jurisdictions. Additionally, as our products and services evolve, and as regulators continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, we may be subject to a variety of additional laws and regulations, or we may be required to further revise or expand our compliance management system, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our clients and their end customers and to monitor transactions. If we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties, such as a cease and desist order, or we may be required to alter the nature or packaging of our services and solutions, any of which could adversely affect our business or operating results.
 The businesses of many of our clients are strictly regulated in every jurisdiction in which they operate, and such regulations, and our clients’ failure to comply with them, could have an adverse effect on our clients’ businesses and, as a result, our results of operations.
 A meaningful portion of our clients are consumer lenders that provide personal loans and automotive loans to consumers that have varying degrees of credit risk. The regulatory environment that these clients operate in is very complex

because applicable regulations are often enacted by multiple agencies in the state and federal governments. For example, the CFPB previously proposed new rules applicable to such loans that could have an adverse effect on our clients’ businesses, and numerous state laws impose similar requirements. Such clients are also subject to negative public perceptions that their consumer lending activities constitute predatory or abusive lending to consumers, and concerns raised by consumer advocacy groups and government officials may lead to efforts to further regulate the industry in which many of our clients operate.
Similarly, our clients in the receivables management industry are typically subject to federal and state rules and regulations that establish specific requirements and procedures that debt collectors must follow when collecting consumer accounts. The CFPB and the FTC devote substantial attention to debt collection activities, and, as a result, the CFPB and the FTC have brought multiple investigations and enforcement actions against debt collectors for violations of the FDCPA and other applicable laws. Continued regulatory scrutiny by the CFPB and the FTC over debt collection practices may result in additional investigations and enforcement actions against our clients in the receivables management industry. The FDCPA also provides for private rights of action against debt collectors, and permits debtors to recover actual damages, statutory damages and attorneys’ fees and costs for violations of its terms.
The combination of these factors, and in particular any changes implemented at the CFPB under the Biden administration, could materially adversely affect the business of our clients and may force our consumer lender or receivables management clients to change their business models. As a result, we may need to be nimble and quickly respond to the evolving needs of the vertical markets that we serve.
If the business of our clients is materially adversely affected by the uncertainties described above and if we or our clients fail to respond to such changes in the industry in a timely manner, or if there are significant changes in such vertical markets that we do not anticipate, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.
We may be required to become licensed under state money transmission statutes.
 We provide payment processing services through our various operating subsidiaries. We, along with our third party service providers, use structural arrangements designed to remove our activities from the scope of money transmitter regulation. There can be no assurance that these structural arrangements will remain effective as money transmitter laws continue to evolve or that the applicable regulatory bodies, particularly state agencies, will view our payment processing activities as compliant. Any determination that we are in fact required to be licensed under the state money transmission statutes may require substantial expenditures of time and money and could lead to liability in the nature of penalties or fines, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business and our financial results.
 We must comply with laws and regulations prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business.
 We and many of our clients are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices and various state laws that are similar in scope and subject matter. In addition, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, the Telemarketing Sales Act and other laws, rules and/or regulations, may directly impact the activities of certain of our clients, and in some cases may subject us, as the electronic payment processor or provider of payment settlement services, to investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds if we are found to have improperly aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal or improper activities of a client through our services. Various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies, including the FTC and state attorneys general have authority to take action against non-banks that engage in UDAAP, or violate other laws, rules and regulations. To the extent we are processing payments or providing products and services for a client suspected of violating such laws, rules and regulations, we may face enforcement actions and incur losses and liabilities that may adversely affect our business.
 Governmental regulations designed to protect or limit access to or use of consumer information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our products and services.
 In addition to those regulations discussed previously that are imposed by the card networks and NACHA, governmental bodies in the United States have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations restricting the use, collection, storage, transfer and disposal of, and requiring safeguarding of, non-public personal information. Our operations are subject to certain provisions of these laws. Applicable federal privacy laws may restrict our collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, may require us to notify individuals of our privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of protected information, and mandate certain procedures with respect to safeguarding and proper description of stored information. Certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations as well as

obligations to provide notification of security breaches of personal information to affected individuals, state officers, consumer reporting agencies and businesses and governmental agencies. The applicable regulatory framework for privacy issues is evolving and is likely to continue doing so for the foreseeable future, which creates uncertainty. The state privacy law framework is described under “Privacy and Information Security Regulations” in Item 1. Business above.
 Further, we are obligated by our clients, sponsor banks and software integration partners to maintain the confidentiality and security of non-public consumer information that our clients and their end customers share with us. Our contracts may require periodic audits by independent parties regarding our compliance with applicable standards, and may permit our counterparties to audit our compliance with best practices established by regulatory guidelines with respect to confidentiality and security of non-public personal information. Our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract, grow and maintain business in the future, and any failure to do so could subject us to contractual liability, each of which could have a material effect on our business and results of operations.
 If we fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contractual terms, or if we experience security breaches, we could face regulatory enforcement proceedings, suits for breach of contract and monetary liabilities. Additionally, any such failure could harm the relationships and reputation we depend on to retain existing clients and software integration partners and obtain new clients and software integration partners. If federal and state governmental bodies adopt more restrictive privacy laws in the future, our compliance costs could increase, and it could make our due diligence reviews and monitoring regarding the risk of our clients more difficult, complex and expensive. As our business grows, we may also be required to invest in a more substantive and complex compliance management system than the one we currently employ.
 Changes in tax laws or their judicial or administrative interpretations, or becoming subject to additional U.S., state or local taxes that cannot be passed through to our clients, could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Our operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal and state and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding and ad valorem taxes. Changes in tax laws or their judicial or administrative interpretations could decrease the amount of revenues we receive, the value of any tax loss carryforwards and tax credits recorded on our balance sheet and the amount of our cash flow, and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Some of our tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the applicable taxing authority which could increase our tax liabilities. Furthermore, companies in the payment processing industry, including us, may become subject to incremental taxation in various taxing jurisdictions. Taxing jurisdictions have not yet adopted uniform positions on this topic. If we are required to pay additional taxes and are unable to pass the tax expense through to our clients, our costs would increase and our net income would be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Failure to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure control could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.
 Effective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, and to operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. As part of our ongoing monitoring of internal control, we have discovered in the past and may discover in the future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control that require remediation. A “material weakness” is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
We have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, material weaknesses and other areas of our internal controls that need improvement. We continue to work to improve our internal controls. We cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain effective controls or to timely implement any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm our reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in the reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. In addition, as a result of such material weaknesses and other matters raised or that may in the future be raised by the SEC, we face potential for litigation or other disputes.
Risks Related to Our Indebtedness


Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, react to changes in the economy or our industry and to raise additional capital to fund operations.
 On December 29, 2021, we increased our existing senior secured credit facilities to a $185.0 million revolving credit facility pursuant to an amendment to the revolving credit agreement with Truist Bank and certain other lenders (as amended, the “Amended Credit Agreement”). On January 19, 2021, we issued $440.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”). Our ability to service our obligations under our indebtedness, including the 2026 Notes and any indebtedness we may incur under the Amended Credit Agreement, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate the necessary cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.
 Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations, and such level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders.
We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility.
 Our indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement bears interest at a variable rate, which, as of December 31, 2022, was based on adjusted London Inter-bank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”). On February 9, 2023, we further amended the Amended Credit Agreement to replace LIBOR with term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as the interest rate benchmark. This benchmark replacement may be higher than the adjusted LIBOR previously available under the Amended Credit Agreement, which could in turn increase our interest expense. This benchmark replacement may also include administrative and operational changes that affect our borrowing practices under the Amended Credit Agreement.
Future operating flexibility is limited by the restrictive covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement, and we may be unable to comply with all covenants in the future.
 The Amended Credit Agreement imposes restrictions that could impede our ability to enter into certain corporate transactions, as well as increases our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our business and industry. These restrictions will limit our ability to, among other things:
 •incur or guarantee additional debt;
 •pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase, retire or otherwise acquire any capital stock;
 •make certain payments, dividends, distributions or investments; and 
 •merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.
 In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement contains certain negative covenants that restrict the incurrence of indebtedness unless certain incurrence-based financial covenant requirements are met. The restrictions may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interests of the business and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants in future periods will largely depend on our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default, which could result in the acceleration of our debt. In the event of an acceleration of our indebtedness, we could be forced to apply all available cash flows to repay such debt, which would reduce or eliminate distributions to us, which could also force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.
We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2026 Notes, or to repurchase the 2026 Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain, limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the 2026 Notes.
 Holders of the 2026 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their 2026 Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the 2026 Notes, unless we elect to cause to be delivered solely shares of our Class A common stock to settle such conversion, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2026 Notes being converted.

However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the 2026 Notes surrendered therefor or to pay cash with respect to the 2026 Notes being converted.
 In addition, our ability to repurchase the 2026 Notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2026 Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the 2026 Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the 2026 Notes (the “indenture”) or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the 2026 Notes as required by the indenture, would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture, or the fundamental change itself, could also lead to a default under our Amended Credit Agreement and other agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness, repurchase, make interest payments on or make cash payments upon conversion of the 2026 Notes.
 The conditional conversion feature of the 2026 Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
 In the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2026 Notes is triggered, holders of the 2026 Notes will be entitled to convert their 2026 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2026 Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class A common stock, we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their 2026 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2026 Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.
 Provisions in the indenture could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of the Company
 Certain provisions of the 2026 Notes and the indenture could make a third party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, then we will be required to make an offer to the holders of the 2026 Notes to repurchase for cash all or part of their outstanding 2026 Notes. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, then we may be required to increase the conversion rate temporarily. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the 2026 Notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that you may view as favorable.
 Risks Related to Our Ownership Structure
 We are a holding company and our only material asset is our interest in Hawk Parent, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions made by our subsidiaries to pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, meet our financial obligations under the 2026 Notes and pay dividends.
 We are a holding company with no material assets other than our ownership of limited liability company interests of Hawk Parent (the “Post-Merger Repay Units” and holders of such Post-Merger Repay Units other than the Company, the “Repay Unitholders”) and our managing member interest in Hawk Parent, and we have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow. Upon the completion of the Business Combination, we entered into that certain Tax Receivable Agreement (the “Tax Receivable Agreement” or “TRA”) with the Repay Unitholders. Our ability to pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, meet our financial obligations under the 2026 Notes and pay dividends will depend on the financial results and cash flows of Hawk Parent and its subsidiaries and the distributions we receive from Hawk Parent. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of Hawk Parent and its subsidiaries, including its operating subsidiaries, for any reason could limit or impair Hawk Parent’s ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent that we need funds and Hawk Parent and/or any of its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of any financing arrangements, or Hawk Parent is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.
 Hawk Parent is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, generally is not subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to Repay Unitholders (including us). Accordingly, we will be required to pay income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of Hawk Parent. Under the terms of Hawk Parent’s Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, Hawk Parent is obligated to make tax distributions to Repay Unitholders (including us) calculated at certain assumed tax rates. In addition to tax expenses, we will also incur expenses related to our operations, including payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement (and the cost of administering such payment obligations), which could be significant. We intend to cause Hawk Parent to make distributions to Repay Unitholders in amounts sufficient to cover all applicable taxes (calculated at assumed tax rates), relevant operating expenses, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and dividends, if any, declared by Hawk Parent. However, as discussed below,

Hawk Parent’s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions including, but not limited to, restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or agreement to which Hawk Parent is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering Hawk Parent insolvent. If our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement and to fund our obligations, we may be required to incur additional indebtedness to provide the liquidity needed to make such payments, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
 Additionally, although Hawk Parent generally is not subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax, it may be liable under recent federal tax legislation for adjustments to its tax return, absent an election to the contrary. In the event Hawk Parent’s calculations of taxable income are incorrect, its members, including us, in later years may be subject to material liabilities pursuant to this federal legislation and its related guidance.
 We anticipate that the distributions we will receive from Hawk Parent may, in certain periods, exceed our actual tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Our board of the directors, in its sole discretion, will make any determination from time to time with respect to the use of any such excess cash so accumulated, which may include, among other uses, to acquire additional newly issued Post-Merger Repay Units from Hawk Parent at a per unit price determined by reference to the market value of the Class A common stock; to pay dividends, which may include special dividends, on our Class A common stock; to fund repurchases of Class A common stock; or any combination of the foregoing. We will have no obligation to distribute such cash (or other available cash other than any declared dividend) to our stockholders. To the extent that we do not distribute such excess cash as dividends on Class A common stock or otherwise undertake ameliorative actions between Post-Merger Repay Units and shares of Class A common stock and instead, for example, hold such cash balances, Repay Unitholders that hold interests in Hawk Parent pre-Business Combination may benefit from any value attributable to such cash balances as a result of their ownership of Class A common stock following an exchange of their Post-Merger Repay Units, notwithstanding that such holders may previously have participated as holders of Post-Merger Repay Units in distributions by Hawk Parent that resulted in such excess cash balances being held by us.
Dividends on our common stock, if any, will be paid at the discretion of our board of directors, which will consider, among other things, our business, operating results, financial condition, current and expected cash needs, plans for expansion and any legal or contractual limitations on our ability to pay such dividends. Financing arrangements may include restrictive covenants that restrict our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to our stockholders. In addition, Hawk Parent is generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of Hawk Parent (with certain exceptions) exceed the fair value of its assets. Hawk Parent’s subsidiaries are generally subject to similar legal limitations on their ability to make distributions to Hawk Parent. If Hawk Parent does not have sufficient funds to make distributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends may also be restricted or impaired.
Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we will be required to pay 100% of the tax benefits relating to tax depreciation or amortization deductions as a result of the tax basis step-up we receive in connection with the exchanges (including an exchange in a sale for cash) of Post-Merger Repay Units into our Class A common stock and related transactions, and those payments may be substantial.
The Repay Unitholders may exchange their Post-Merger Repay Units for shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, subject to certain conditions as set forth therein and in Hawk Parent’s Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, or in an exchange in a sale for cash. These exchanges are expected to result in increases in our allocable share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Hawk Parent. These increases in tax basis may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of income or franchise tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future had such exchanges never occurred.
 In connection with the Business Combination, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement, which generally provides for the payment to the Repay Unitholders by us of 100% of certain tax benefits, if any, that we realize (or in certain cases are deemed to realize) (a portion of which will be paid in turn to certain service providers on behalf of them in respect of certain transaction expenses) as a result of these increases in tax basis and certain other tax attributes of Hawk Parent and tax benefits related to entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. These payments are our obligation and not an obligation of Hawk Parent. The actual increase in our allocable share of Hawk Parent’s tax basis in its assets, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax

Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the market price of the Class A common stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of the recognition of our income. While many of the factors that will determine the amount of payments that we will make under the Tax Receivable Agreement are outside of our control, we expect that the payments we will make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Any payments made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. Furthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that may be deemed realized under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
 In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may exceed the actual tax benefits we realize or be accelerated.
 Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, and the Internal Revenue Service or another taxing authority may challenge all or any part of the tax basis increases, as well as other tax positions that we take, and a court may sustain such a challenge. In the event any tax benefits initially claimed by us are disallowed, the current Repay Unitholders will not be required to reimburse us for any excess payments that may previously have been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, for example, due to adjustments resulting from examinations by taxing authorities. Rather, excess payments made to such holders will be netted against any future cash payments otherwise required to be made by us, if any, after the determination of such excess. However, a challenge to any tax benefits initially claimed by us may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment or, even if challenged early, such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement and, as a result, there might not be future cash payments from which to net against. As a result, in certain circumstances, we could make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of our actual income or franchise tax savings, which could materially impair our financial condition.
 Moreover, the Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, in the event that (i) we exercise our early termination rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement, (ii) we become bankrupt or undergo a similar insolvency event, (iii) certain changes of control of us occur (as described in the Tax Receivable Agreement) or (iv) we are more than three months late in making of a payment due under the Tax Receivable Agreement (unless we in good faith determine that we have insufficient funds to make such payment), our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will accelerate and we will be required to make an immediate lump-sum cash payment to the Repay Unitholders equal to the present value of all forecasted future payments that would have otherwise been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which lump-sum payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to our future taxable income. The lump-sum payment to the Repay Unitholders could be substantial and could exceed the actual tax benefits that we realize subsequent to such payment because such payment would be calculated assuming, among other things, that we would be able to use the assumed potential tax benefits in future years, and that tax rates applicable to us would be the same as they were in the year of the termination.
 There may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement exceed the actual income or franchise tax savings that we realize. Furthermore, our obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. We may need to incur additional indebtedness to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise. Such indebtedness may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
 Risks Related to our Class A Common Stock
 Future issuances or sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such issuances or sales may occur, could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline.
 Hawk Parent has outstanding an aggregate of 7,861,271 Post-Merger Repay Units as of February 22, 2023. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, Repay Unitholders have the right to elect to exchange such Post-Merger Repay Units into shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to the terms of the Exchange Agreement. However, Hawk Parent may elect to settle such exchange in cash in lieu of delivering shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement.

In addition, we have reserved a total of 13,826,728 shares of Class A common stock for issuance under our Repay Holdings Corporation Omnibus Incentive Plan (as amended, the “Incentive Plan.”). Of these shares, 7,305,413 shares of Class A common stock remain available for future issuance under the Incentive Plan as of February 22, 2023. To the extent such shares have vested or vest in the future (and settle into shares, in the case of restricted stock units), they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates.
 If these stockholders exercise their sale or exchange rights and sell shares or are perceived by the market as intending to sell shares, the market price of our shares of Class A common stock could drop significantly. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through offerings of our shares of Class A common stock or other securities at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.
 We also have outstanding $440.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes which are convertible into shares of our Class A common stock in certain circumstances. Investors will incur further dilution upon the conversion of any of our 2026 Notes if we elect to deliver shares of Class A common stock upon such conversion. In the future, we may also issue additional securities in connection with investments, acquisitions or capital raising activities, which could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and may result in additional dilution to investors or adversely impact the price of our Class A common stock.
 Our stock price may be volatile, which could negatively affect our business and operations.
 Historically, our Class A common stock has experienced substantial price volatility. For example, the closing price per share of our Class A common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market ranged from a low of $4.38 to a high of $19.54 during the period from January 3, 2022 to December 30, 2022. This volatility could be the result of changes in our volumes, revenue, earnings and margins or general market and economic factors. If our future operating results or margins are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors, our stock price will likely decline.
 Speculation and opinions in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations or significant transactions can also cause changes in our stock price. In particular, speculation on our go-forward strategy, competition in some of the markets we address and the effect of general economic and political conditions (such as recession concerns, interest rate changes and inflation) on our business, may have a dramatic effect on our stock price.
 Volatility in the stock price of our common stock or other reasons may in the future cause us to become the target of securities litigation or shareholder activism. Securities litigation and shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and board of directors’ attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such securities litigation and shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to any securities litigation or activist shareholder matters.
 Because we do not currently intend to pay dividends, holders of our Class A common stock will benefit from an investment in our Class A common stock only if it appreciates in value.
 We have never declared or paid any dividends on our Class A common stock, and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our Class A common stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.
 Delaware law and our governing documents contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to take certain actions and could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.
 Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors and therefore depress the trading price of our Class A common stock. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to take certain actions, including electing directors who are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or taking other corporate actions, including effecting changes in management. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions regarding:
 •a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors (until our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, at which time this provision will terminate);


•the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock, including “blank check” preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;
 •the right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;
 •the requirement that directors may only be removed from the board of directors for cause (until our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, at which time this provision will terminate);
 •a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent (except in limited circumstances), which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a stockholder proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;
 •the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors or our chief executive officer, which could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;
 •controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of our board of directors and stockholder meetings;
 •the ability of our board of directors to amend our bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and
 •advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in our board of directors and also may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
 In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are generally subject to provisions of Delaware law, including the DGCL. Although we have elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, in a manner substantially similar to Section 203 of the DGCL, prohibit certain of our stockholders (other than those stockholders who are party to a stockholders’ agreement with us) who hold 15% or more of our outstanding capital stock from engaging in certain business combination transactions with us for a specified period of time unless certain conditions are met.
 Our certificate of incorporation designates a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.
 Our certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any other court located in the State of Delaware with subject matter jurisdiction, will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, other employees or stockholders to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or our officers or directors arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware.
 Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities will be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us or our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find these exclusive-forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.
