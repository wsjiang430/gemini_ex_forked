SEGMENT OVERVIEW
Performance Coatings
Through our Performance Coatings segment, we provide high-quality liquid and powder coatings solutions to a fragmented and local customer base, as well as a number of regional and global customers. We are one of only a few suppliers with the technology to provide precise color matching and highly durable coatings systems. The end-markets within this segment are refinish and industrial.
Performance Coatings End-Markets
Refinish
Sales in the refinish end-market are driven by the number of vehicle collisions, owners’ propensity to repair their vehicles, the number of miles vehicle owners drive and the size of the car parc. Although refinish coatings typically represent only a small portion of the overall vehicle repair cost, they are critical to the vehicle owner’s satisfaction given their impact on appearance. As a result, body shop operators are most focused on coatings brands with a strong track record of performance and reliability. Body shops look for suppliers and brands with productivity enhancements, regulatory compliance, consistent quality, the presence of ongoing technical support and exact color match technologies. Color matching is a critical component of coatings supplier selection, since inexact matching adversely impacts vehicle appearance, and if repainting is required due to a poor match, it can significantly impact the speed and volume of repairs at a given shop.
We develop, market and supply a complete portfolio of innovative coatings systems and color matching technologies to facilitate faster automotive collision repairs relative to competing technologies. Our color matching technology provides Axalta-specific formulations that enable body shops to accurately match thousands of vehicle colors, regardless of vehicle brand, color, age or supplier of the original paint during production. It would be time consuming and costly for a new entrant to create such an extensive color inventory. 
Industrial
The industrial end-market is comprised of liquid and powder coatings used in a broad array of end-market applications. Within the industrial end-market, we focus on the following:

• | General Industrial: coatings for a wide and diverse array of applications, including HVAC, shelving, appliances and electrical storage components, metal furniture, industrial components, sports equipment and playground equipment as well as ACE, fencing, valves and specialized coatings used for coating the interior of metal drums and packaging and coatings for the exterior of glass bottles.


• | Electrical Insulation Systems: coatings to insulate copper wire used in motors and transformers and coatings to insulate sheets forming magnetic circuits of motors and transformers, computer elements and other electrical components.


• | Architectural: exterior powder and liquid coatings typically used in the construction of extrusions for commercial structures, residential windows, doors and cladding.


• | Transportation: liquid and powder coatings for vehicle components, chassis and wheels to protect against corrosion, provide increased durability and impart appropriate aesthetics.


• | Oil & Gas: liquid and powder products to coat tanks, pipelines, valves and fittings protecting against chemicals, corrosion and extreme temperatures in the oil & gas industry.


• | Coil: coatings utilized in various applications such as metal building roof and wall panels, residential and commercial steel roofing, gutters, appliances, lighting, garage and entry doors, HVAC, office furniture and truck trailers.


• | Wood: coatings utilized in OEM and aftermarket industrial wood markets, including building products, cabinets, flooring and furniture.

Demand in this end-market is driven by a wide variety of macroeconomic factors, such as growth in GDP, new residential and commercial construction and industrial production. There has also been an increase in demand for products that enhance environmental sustainability, corrosion resistance, productivity, and color aesthetics. These global trends are bolstered by regional and industry specific trends. Customers select industrial coatings based on protection, durability and appearance.
Performance Coatings Products and Brands
We offer a comprehensive range of specially-formulated waterborne and solventborne products and systems used by the global automotive repair industry to refinish damaged vehicles. Our refinish products and systems include a range of coatings layers required to match the vehicle’s color and appearance, producing a repair surface indistinguishable from the adjacent surface. 
We provide systems that enable body shops to match more than 200,000 color variations, using a database with more than four million formulations, in the global market. Our color technology is manifested in the pigment technology that goes into our tints, one of the most technologically advanced parts of the refinish coatings system, which makes up the majority of our products in a body shop. We have a large color library and a number of well-known, long-standing premium brands, including Cromax®, Standox®, Spies Hecker®, and our newest mainstream product, Syrox™, which was introduced in EMEA in 2016, as well as other regional and local brands. 
Our color matching and retrieval systems allow customers to quickly match any color, preventing body shop technicians from having to repeat the color matching process, saving time and materials. The color matching process begins with a technician scanning a damaged vehicle with one of our advanced color matching tools, such as our Acquire Plus EFX™ hand-held spectrophotometer. The Acquire Plus EFX lens reads the color, evaluating both the unique flake and color characteristics of the specific vehicle. These characteristics may vary significantly, even for vehicles of the same make, model and original color, due to a variety of factors, including a vehicle’s age, plant at which it was assembled, weather conditions and operating history. The Acquire Plus EFX electronically connects with our ColorNet® database and generates for the paint technician the precise mix of tints and colors needed to recreate that specific color needed for the part being repaired. In addition to the Acquire Plus EFX, we offer customers several other color matching tools, including our VINdicator® database, which identifies vehicle color based on its vehicle identification number, and traditional color matching wheels and fan decks. 
We are also a leading global developer, manufacturer and supplier of functional and decorative liquid and powder coatings for a large number of diversified applications in the industrial end-market. We provide a full portfolio of products for applications including architectural cladding and fittings, automotive components, general industrial, job coaters, electrical insulation coatings, HVAC, appliances, aluminum extrusions, rebar and oil & gas pipelines. Through an acquisition completed in 2017, we have also become a leading manufacturer and supplier of wood coatings sold into the building product, cabinet, flooring and furniture end-markets in North America. Our liquid systems are used to provide insulation and corrosion protection for electrical conductors and components, provide chemical resistance for the interiors of metal packaging drums, protect automotive parts and serve as basecoats for alloy and steel wheels. Powder coatings products are often an environmentally responsible, higher transfer efficiency alternative to liquid coatings. These coatings are typically electrostatically sprayed using a specialized spray gun and cured to create a uniform, high-quality finish. In the oil & gas industry our powder and liquid products are used to protect components from corrosion and severe conditions such as extreme temperatures.
Our major industrial brands include Voltatex®, AquaEC™, ZENITH®, Durapon®, Hydropon® and Ceranamel® for liquid coatings and Alesta®, Nap-Gard®, Abcite® and Plascoat® for powder.
Performance Coatings Sales, Marketing and Distribution
We leverage a large global refinish sales and technical support team to effectively serve our broad refinish customer base of approximately 80,000 body shops. The majority of our products are supplied by our network of approximately 4,000 independent local distributors. In select regions, including parts of Europe, we also sell directly to customers. Distributors maintain an inventory of our products to fill orders from body shops in their market and assume credit risk and responsibility for logistics, delivery and billing. In certain countries, we utilize importers that buy directly from us and actively market our products to body shops. Our relationships with our top ten distributors are longstanding and continue to contribute to our success in the global refinish market.
Our large sales force manages relationships directly with our end-customers to drive demand for our products, which in turn are purchased through customers in our distributor network. Due to the local nature of the refinish industry, our sales force operates on a regional/country basis to provide clients with responsive customer service and local insight. As part of their coverage efforts, salespeople introduce new products to body shops and provide technical support and ongoing training. We have 47 customer training centers established globally, which helps to deepen our customer relationships.
Our sales force also helps to drive shop productivity improvements and to install or upgrade body shop color matching and mixing equipment to improve shop profitability. Once a coating and color system is installed, a body shop almost exclusively uses its specific supplier’s products. The proprietary nature of a coatings supplier’s color systems, the substantial inventory needed to support a body shop and the body shop’s familiarity with an established brand lead to high levels of customer retention. Our customer retention rate levels have been and continue to be strong.
To effectively reach our customers in the industrial end-market we generally ship directly and leverage a dedicated sales force and technical service team that operates on a regional basis. We are one of only three truly global powder coatings producers that can satisfy the needs and specifications of a customer in multiple regions of the world, while maximizing productivity from the broad scale and scope of our operations.
Performance Coatings Customers
Within our Performance Coatings segment, we sell coatings to customers in more than 130 countries. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 18% of our Performance Coatings net sales during the year ended December 31, 2018.
In our industrial and refinish end-markets we serve a broad, fragmented customer base. Our industrial end-market is comprised of a wide variety of industrial manufacturers, while our refinish end-market is comprised of approximately 80,000 body shops, including:

• | Independent Body Shops: Single location body shops that utilize premium, mainstream or economy brands based on the local market.


• | Multi-Shop Operators ("MSOs"): Body shops with more than one location focused on providing premium paint jobs with industry leading efficiency. MSOs use premium/mainstream coatings and state-of-the-art painting technology to increase shop productivity, allowing them to repair more vehicles faster.

Through our Transportation Coatings segment, we provide advanced coatings technologies to OEMs of light and commercial vehicles. These increasingly global customers require a high level of technical support coupled with cost-effective, environmentally responsible coatings systems that can be applied with a high degree of precision, consistency and speed. 
Transportation Coatings End-Markets
Light Vehicle
Demand for light vehicle products is driven by the production of light vehicles in a particular region. Light vehicle OEMs select coatings providers on the basis of their global ability to deliver advanced technological solutions that improve exterior appearance and durability and provide long-term corrosion protection. Customers also look for suppliers that can enhance process efficiency to reduce overall manufacturing costs and provide on-site technical support. Rigorous environmental and durability testing as well as obtaining engineering approvals are also key criteria used by global light vehicle OEMs when selecting coatings providers. Globally integrated suppliers are important because they offer products with consistent standards across regions and are able to deliver high-quality products in sufficient quantity while meeting OEM service requirements. Our global scale, differentiated technology platform and customer focus, including on-site support, position us to be a global partner and solutions provider to the most discerning and demanding light vehicle OEMs. We are one of the few coatings producers that can provide OEMs with global product specifications, standardized color development, compatibility with an ever-increasing number of substrates, increasingly complex colors and environmentally responsible coatings while continuing to simplify and reduce steps in the coating application process.
Commercial Vehicle
Sales in the commercial vehicle end-market are generated from a variety of applications, including non-automotive transportation (e.g., HDT, bus and rail), motorcycles, marine and aviation, as well as related markets such as trailers, recreational vehicles and personal sport vehicles. This end-market is primarily driven by global commercial vehicle production, which is influenced by overall economic activity, government infrastructure spending, equipment replacement cycles and evolving environmental standards.
Commercial vehicle OEMs select coatings providers on the basis of their ability to consistently deliver advanced technological solutions that improve exterior appearance, protection and durability and provide extensive color libraries and matching capabilities at the lowest total cost-in-use, while meeting stringent environmental requirements. Particularly for HDT applications, truck owners demand a greater variety of custom colors and advanced product technologies to enable custom designs. Our strong market position and growth are driven by our ability to provide customers with our market-leading brand, Imron®, as well as leveraging our global product lines, regional knowledge and service. Additionally, to capture further growth we are launching a new suite of products to meet our customers’ evolving needs.
Transportation Coatings Products and Brands
We develop and supply a complete coatings product line for light vehicle OEMs for the original coating of new vehicles. Products are designed to enhance the styling and appearance of a vehicle’s exterior while providing protection from the elements, extending the life of the vehicle. Widely recognized in the industry for our advanced and patented technologies, our products not only increase productivity and profitability for OEMs but also produce attractive and durable finishes. Our light vehicle coatings portfolio is one of the broadest in the industry.
The coatings operation is a critical component of the vehicle assembly process, requiring a high degree of precision and speed. The paint shop process typically includes a dip process, three application zones and three high-temperature ovens that cure each coating layer at temperatures ranging from 320°F to 400°F (i.e., "high bake"). Our key products consist of the four main coatings layers: electrocoat (AquaEC™), primer (HyperDur™), basecoat (ChromaDyne™) and clearcoat (Lumeera™). 
The coatings process accounts for a majority of the total energy consumed during the vehicle manufacturing process. As a result, we have developed Harmonized Coating TechnologiesTM, including 3-Wet, Eco-Concept and 2-Wet Monocoat, that help our OEM customers lower costs by reducing energy consumption while increasing productivity. 
OEMs are also increasingly looking to reduce the weight of vehicles in response to increasing vehicle emissions and fuel consumption regulations. As a result, OEMs are constructing vehicle platforms using a variety of new materials in addition to steel and plastic, including aluminum, carbon fiber and other substrates, each of which requires specialized coatings formulations to create a uniform color and finish. We continue to innovate with our OEM customers in driving this trend, as evidenced by use of our coatings on their flagship vehicle platforms.
We also develop and supply a wide array of coatings systems for a broad range of commercial applications including HDT, bus, rail and ACE. These products simultaneously enhance aesthetic appearance and provide protection from the elements. We meet the demands of commercial vehicle customers with our extensive offering of over 75,000 different colors. In the HDT market, because the metal and composite components are painted simultaneously in an automatic process, most truck OEMs use low bake coatings to ensure that the plastic composite parts on a truck’s exterior do not deform during the process. Truck owners demand a wide variety of custom colors that are formulated using a combination of on-site mixing machines at the OEM or direct shipments of premixed high-volume colors from us. Our commercial vehicle brands include Imron®, Imron ExcelPro®, Imron Elite®, Centari®, Rival®, Corlar® epoxy undercoats and AquaEC™.

Transportation Coatings Customers
We provide our products to light and commercial vehicle customers at over 200 assembly plants worldwide, including nine of the top ten global automotive manufacturers. We have a stable customer base with several relationships dating back approximately 90 years and believe we are well positioned with the fastest growing OEMs in both the developed and emerging markets. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 68% of our Transportation Coatings net sales during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Transportation Coatings Competition
We primarily compete against large multi-national suppliers such as PPG and BASF in the light and commercial vehicle end-markets. Additionally, we compete against certain regional players in Asia Pacific. With our state-of-the-art coatings solutions and local presence in key OEM markets, we are one of the few competitors in the industry that offers global manufacturers the combination of high-quality products, personalized, top-rate technical service and short lead-times for product delivery.
KEY RAW MATERIALS 
We use thousands of different raw materials, which fall into seven broad categories: liquid resins, powder resins, pigments, solvents, monomers, isocyanates and additives. On average, our total raw material spend represents between 45% and 55% of our cost of sales. We purchase raw materials from a diverse group of suppliers, with our top ten suppliers representing approximately 30% of our 2018 spending on raw materials. 
Approximately 65% of the raw materials we procure are derived from crude oil and natural gas. While prices for these raw materials fluctuate with energy prices, such fluctuations are somewhat mitigated by the fact that the majority of our raw materials are fourth to sixth generation derivatives of crude oil and natural gas. The dynamics of supply and demand play a much more critical role in our cost of raw materials than just the price of crude oil. Non-petrochemical based inputs such as minerals that are used to manufacture coating pigments are not significantly affected by volatility in crude oil prices but tend to be impacted by the supply-demand dynamics of their industry. 
Historically, to manage raw material volatility, we have used a combination of price increases to customers and, in limited circumstances, contractual raw material recovery mechanisms. Since 2001, our variable cost of sales has remained stable between 35% and 43% of net sales. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Our focus on technology has allowed us to proactively provide customers with next-generation offerings that enhance product performance, improve productivity and satisfy increasingly strict environmental regulations. Since our entry into the coatings industry over 150 years ago, we believe we have consistently been at the forefront of coatings technology innovation. These innovations have played a fundamental role in our ability to maintain and grow our global market share as well as deliver substantial financial returns.
We believe that we are a technology leader well positioned to benefit from continued industry shifts in customer needs. Our markets are among the most demanding in the coatings industry with high levels of product performance that continuously evolves, with increasing expectations for productivity on customer lines and with environmentally responsible products. Our technology development is led by a highly experienced and educated workforce that is focused on new product development, color development, technical customer support and improving our manufacturing processes. As such, our technology development covers two critical interrelated aspects for us, including research and development as well as technical support and manufacturing. In total, as of December 31, 2018, we have approximately 1,400 employees dedicated to technology development. We operate four major technology centers throughout the world where we develop and align our technology investments with regional business needs complemented by over 30 regional laboratories which provide local connection to our global customer base. This includes our new Global Innovation Center located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania which opened in 2018 for global research, product development and technology initiatives.
PATENTS, LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS
As of December 31, 2018, we had a portfolio of over 740 issued patents and more than 400 trademarks. We actively apply for and obtain U.S. and foreign patents and trademarks on new products and process innovations and as of December 31, 2018, 189 patent applications were pending throughout the world. 
Our primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect the results of our research for use in operations and licensing.

JOINT VENTURES
We are party to 12 joint ventures, five of which are focused on the industrial end-market. We are the majority shareholder, and/or exercise control in our nine consolidated joint ventures. Our fully consolidated joint venture-related net sales were $315.6 million, $296.0 million and $231.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Risks Related to Other Aspects of our Business—Our joint ventures may not operate according to our business strategy if our joint venture partners fail to fulfill their obligations."
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 14,000 employees located throughout the world consisting of sales, technical, manufacturing operations, supply chain, administrative and customer service personnel. 
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 38% of our employees globally were covered by organized labor agreements, including works councils, with fewer than 10 employees in the United States covered by organized labor agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good overall.
ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY
We are committed to environmental stewardship and to health, safety and sustainability excellence in our global operations. As such, we operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and health and safety of our employees and neighboring communities.
Safety is integrated into the way we do business. Our safety program is structured on the foundation that every employee is engaged and committed to improving safe operating practices and eliminating injuries. When health and safety incidents do occur, we strive to determine the causes and eliminate the potential for future similar incidents. In 2018, Axalta’s injury and illness performance resulted in a 0.38 OSHA Recordable Incident Rate, compared to the 2.0 OSHA Recordable Incident Rate for the General Chemical Industry (according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics 2017 data). 
Our Environment, Health, Safety (EHS) and Sustainability policies and standards are a key element of the foundation upon which we develop, market, manufacture, and distribute products and services to our global customers. In 2017 we established a Board-level committee responsible for our EHS and Sustainability policies, performance, strategy and compliance matters. We operate our manufacturing facilities using a common set of internal standards. These standards support a consistent approach to EHS and Sustainability performance improvement. We strive to assure that all our manufacturing and distribution facilities are operated in compliance in all known material respects to applicable environmental requirements.
Many of our manufacturing sites have a long history of industrial operations and government required remediation is or may be required at a number of these locations. Although we are indemnified by DuPont for certain environmental liabilities and we do not expect outstanding remediation obligations to have a material impact on our financial position, the ultimate cost of remediation is subject to a number of variables and difficult to accurately predict. We may also incur significant additional costs as a result of contamination that is discovered and/or government required remediation obligations that are imposed at these or other properties in the future.
During 2016, Axalta achieved and continues to maintain a global, multi-site certification for RC14001. This certification incorporates the elements of the American Chemistry Council’s Responsible Care Program including product safety and compliance, process safety and security, as well as the ISO 14001 certification specifically related to our environmental stewardship program. We anticipate all manufacturing locations will be covered by this certificate by 2020.
