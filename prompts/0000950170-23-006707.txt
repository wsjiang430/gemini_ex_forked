Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on pioneering the development of a new class of oncology drugs we refer to as selective translation regulator inhibitors (“STRIs”). Translation is the process in cells whereby the synthesis of proteins is directed by information contained in genetic sequences. We utilized our proprietary selective translation regulation technology platform to internally discover a portfolio of small molecule STRI product candidates. Our product candidates target the eIF4F complex and its activating kinase, MNK. The eIF4F complex is a central node where two of the most frequently mutated signaling pathways in cancer, the PI3K-AKT and RAS-MEK pathways, converge to activate the translation of select messenger RNA (“mRNA”) into proteins that are frequent culprits in key disease-driving processes. Inhibition of these targets simultaneously downregulates multiple disease-driving proteins before they are synthesized. Each of our product candidates is designed to act on a single protein that drives the expression of multiple functionally related proteins, including oncoproteins, which are proteins whose aberrant function can cause cancer, immunosuppressive proteins in T cells and proteins known to drive drug resistance that together control tumor growth, survival and immune evasion.
Our lead product candidate, tomivosertib, is an inhibitor of MNK, and is currently being evaluated in combination with KEYTRUDA® (also known as pembrolizumab), an FDA-approved inhibitor of programmed cell death protein 1 (“PD-1”) in a randomized Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). Our second product candidate, zotatifin, is an inhibitor of eIF4A, a component of the eIF4F complex, and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with certain solid tumors. We have completed the initial dose escalation portion of this trial and are currently evaluating zotatifin in combination with fulvestrant and abemaciclib in a Phase 2a open-label expansion cohort in patients with ER+ breast cancer. In light of the favorable safety results observed to date in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, we have also resumed dose escalation of zotatifin in combination with fulvestrant in patients with ER+ breast cancer to determine if a higher dose of zotatifin can be utilized in future clinical studies. We have also completed a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating zotatifin as an antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2. We have entered into a global collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer for our earliest stage program, inhibitors of eIF4E, and Pfizer is currently conducting investigational new drug application (“IND”) enabling studies for this program. We believe each of our product candidates has the potential to improve patient outcomes and expand the utility of cancer treatments such as checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies.
 The following table summarizes our current programs:
 
Figure 1: Our Pipeline
 




Targeting the eIF4F Complex and MNK
 
The eIF4F complex plays a critical role in the production of certain proteins that promote cell growth and division. During normal cellular function, extracellular factors such as growth factors or antigens, bind to cell surface receptors such as receptor tyrosine kinases (“RTKs”) and T cell receptors (“TCRs”) which initiate signaling through the PI3K-AKT and RAS-MEK pathways to stimulate growth. Under normal conditions, RTKs and TCRs are stimulated only transiently when cell growth and proliferation are required. However, when eIF4F activation is excessive and continuous, either because of oncogenic mutations that activate the PI3K-AKT and RAS-MEK pathways or the continuous presentation of antigens to TCRs in cancer, this results in a sustained upregulation of protein synthesis. This sustained upregulation leads to uncontrolled growth of tumor cells and exhaustion of T cells, which causes T cells to become less effective cancer fighters. Inhibiting targets in the eIF4F complex downregulates production of disease-driving proteins before they are synthesized. Proteins in tumor cells that are controlled by the eIF4F complex include: (1) multiple oncoproteins currently addressed by targeted therapies, such as RTKs and KRAS; (2) oncoproteins for which there are currently no targeted therapies available, such as MYC and Cyclin D1; and (3) certain proteins that are often upregulated in response to targeted therapies as a resistance mechanism, such as Cyclin D1, CDK4/6, RTKs, and KRAS. In T cells, MNK controls the production of multiple immunosuppressive factors including PD-1, PD-L1, TIM3, LAG3 and IL-10 that serve to exhaust the T cells and attenuate an immune response.
 We believe there are several potential advantages of targeting MNK and the eIF4F complex. First, we can simultaneously aim to inhibit the production of multiple key disease -driving proteins that tumor cells have hijacked for growth, proliferation and survival. Rather than inhibiting a single target oncoprotein, our product candidates are each designed to downregulate multiple target oncoproteins that are often co-produced in cancer cells, or multiple immunosuppressive factors produced in activated T cells. In addition, our product candidates are designed to downregulate many proteins that are frequently over-produced by feedback pathways as resistance mechanisms that cause tumors to become less responsive to targeted therapies. Moreover, some of the disease-driving proteins such as MYC and Cyclin D1 that our product candidates are designed to downregulate are not currently addressable by any existing marketed agents due to the cellular location and complex shape of these targets. Lastly, our product candidates are designed to preserve normal cell function while at the same time enhancing tumor cell killing because these over-produced disease-driving proteins, which are dependent on MNK and the eIF4F complex for their production, are more critical for the growth and survival of tumor cells than normal cells.
 
Tomivosertib, a Potent and Highly Selective MNK Inhibitor
 
Our lead product candidate, tomivosertib, is an oral small molecule inhibitor of MNK that we are developing in combination with inhibitors of PD-1 and programmed cell death ligand 1 (“PD-L1”), collectively what we refer to as anti PD-(L)1 therapy, for the treatment of patients with solid tumors. MNK is a kinase that phosphorylates, or modifies by the enzymatic addition of a phosphate chemical group, a key protein within the eIF4F complex. Through inhibition of MNK, tomivosertib is designed to downregulate production of multiple immune-suppressive proteins and to reprogram T cells to delay exhaustion and dysfunction, increasing their ability to combat tumor cells. Tomivosertib has been shown to downregulate production of multiple immunosuppressive proteins, including PD-1, PD-L1, TIM3, LAG3 and IL-10, in preclinical studies. MNK plays a crucial role in the development of many tumors, including by controlling in a coordinated manner the expression of multiple factors that attenuate an immune response. Immune attenuation is a normal biological process that prevents overstimulation of the immune system. However, tumors frequently exploit the attenuation process in order to evade immune control. In preclinical studies, tomivosertib inhibited MNK, and enhanced the ability of the immune system to attack tumors. Immune checkpoints, such as PD-1, PD-L1, TIM3 and LAG3, are signaling molecules expressed on immune and tumor cells that can activate multiple mechanisms to attenuate an anti-tumor immune response. Over the past several years, a class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, primarily anti PD-(L)1 therapies, have emerged as an important new class of therapeutics in the treatment of cancer with the ability to block these immune checkpoint pathways. In 2022, the worldwide market value for anti PD-(L)1 therapies was greater than $35 billion, of which nearly half accounted for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC. While checkpoint inhibitor treatment is very effective in patients for a variety of cancers, these agents are generally not curative, and a large majority of patients ultimately

progress on their checkpoint inhibitor therapy, emphasizing the need for novel frontline combination treatments that may increase the proportion of patients that experience long term durable benefit, and delay progression in other patients. We are currently using PD-L1 expression level greater than or equal to 50% ("PD-L1≥50%") as a biomarker to enroll patients in the ongoing KICKSTART Phase 2b clinical trial of tomivosertib. There are an estimated 27,000 new U.S. patients per year with metastatic NSCLC that have PD-L1≥50%, which we estimate represents a $4 billion market opportunity in the United States. We also believe tomivosertib can be used to treat patients with PD-L1 expression levels 1-49%, which we estimate to represent another $5 billion dollar market opportunity in the Unites States.
 Based on the encouraging results in our Phase 2a clinical trial, we are currently enrolling in KICKSTART, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b trial of tomivosertib combined with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic NSCLC, with PD-L1≥50%. Pembrolizumab is owned and marketed by Merck for frontline NSCLC and several other indications. We initiated this trial in the second quarter of 2021 and anticipate reporting topline data from the KICKSTART trial in the second half of 2023.
 In our completed Phase 2a CPI-A clinical trial evaluating tomivosertib in combination with anti PD-(L)1 therapy in 17 patients with metastatic, NSCLC tomivosertib substantially extended the median progression free survival (“mPFS”), the time duration during which patients remain alive and experience no disease progression, defined as an increase in their tumor assessment of greater than 20% or appearance of new lesions, in patients that were previously not responding to their anti PD-(L)1 therapies. In addition, as of study completion in September 2020, two of those 17 patients (12%) had confirmed partial responses, or decreases in tumor assessments of greater than or equal to 30% from baseline (“PRs”), one of which went on to achieve a confirmed complete response, or no detectable tumor lesions (“CR”) with a third patient showing 28% tumor regression. Tomivosertib was generally well tolerated in this clinical trial. In these 17 patients, once tomivosertib was added without any change or break in the anti PD-(L)1 therapy, there was a mPFS of 20 weeks. In this trial, patients with positive PD-L1 expression, a biomarker of T cell infiltration into tumors, as determined by post-hoc analysis of available data from diagnostic assays conducted during their treatment history, had mPFS of 53 weeks relative to 9 weeks for PD-L1 negative patients. Tomivosertib has been tested in over 200 patients in completed studies, including approximately 80 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, and has demonstrated a favorable adverse event profile both as a single agent and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors.
 We are enrolling NSCLC patients in KICKSTART with PD-L1≥50%. Patients with PD-L1≥50% are the most responsive to pembrolizumab monotherapy in the frontline setting. In this setting, pembrolizumab monotherapy is a standard-of-care and pembrolizumab is the most widely used checkpoint treatment. Beyond this initial KICKSTART patient population, we plan to pursue additional clinical trials of tomivosertib NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression 1-49% and in other indications where anti PD-(L)1 therapy is the standard-of-care, including other cancers where PD-(L)1 therapy is approved such as renal, bladder, triple negative breast cancer, or tumors with high microsatellite instability (“MSI-H”).
 Our preclinical studies suggest combining tomivosertib with anti PD-(L)1 treatments can overcome mechanisms of resistance to checkpoint inhibitors, resulting in enhanced and durable sensitivity. In addition, our preclinical data demonstrated that tomivosertib, either as a single agent or in combination with anti PD-1 treatment, promoted anti-tumor immunity that persisted after stopping drug treatment. We believe that a key advantage of our approach is that by inhibiting MNK, tomivosertib is designed to downregulate the production of multiple immune checkpoint and immunosuppressive cytokine proteins in a coordinated manner to activate an immune response against tumors. Our preclinical data demonstrated that tomivosertib activity addressed key mechanisms of checkpoint inhibitor resistance by:
 •increased target cell killing;
 •simultaneous downregulation of several key checkpoint proteins associated with T cell exhaustion and dysfunction, including PD-1, PD-L1, LAG-3 and TIM-3;
 •decreased production of immunosuppressive IL-10; and 
 •increased memory T cell population.
 Collectively, these effects may complement checkpoint inhibitors by increasing tumor recognition, restoring immune response, improving durability of response and preserving antitumor immunity.
 

Zotatifin—A Potent and Selective eIF4A mRNA Helicase Inhibitor
 
Our second product candidate, zotatifin, is a small molecule designed to inhibit eIF4A, and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with solid tumors. eIF4A is a helicase and is responsible for unwinding complex secondary structures, found in the 5’ untranslated region (“UTR”) of certain mRNA. This unwinding is a regulatory control step that leads to efficient stimulated production of important proteins that enable normal cells to respond to growth signals, and which are upregulated in tumor cells. Proteins in tumor cells that are controlled by eIF4A include multiple oncoproteins currently addressed by targeted therapies, oncoproteins for which there are currently no targeted therapies available and certain proteins that are often upregulated in response to targeted therapies as a resistance mechanism. Several of these oncoproteins can function in concert within a vertical signaling pathway to drive tumor growth, proliferation and survival in cancer, including certain breast cancers and NSCLC. In our preclinical studies, we discovered that most proteins inhibited by zotatifin have common distinct translation initiation regulatory elements in the 5’ UTR of the mRNA recognized by zotatifin. Our preclinical data showed that zotatifin inhibition at physiologic concentrations in vitro only impacted translation of approximately 5% of mRNAs in a cell. Further, because these translation initiation regulatory elements are located in the mRNA prior to and independent from the coding sequences that dictate the amino acids included in protein synthesis, their inhibition is independent of protein mutation variants. We have initiated multiple Phase 2a expansion cohorts with zotatifin both as a single agent and in combination with targeted agents in ER+ breast cancer, FGFR+ breast cancer, and KRAS mutant NSCLC, and are currently focused on combinations in ER+ breast cancer. Together, we believe the estimated target population of breast cancer and NSCLC patients that meet the enrollment criteria in our Phase 2a expansion cohorts totals approximately 82,000 in the United States.
 
Zotatifin as an Antiviral Agent for COVID-19
 In collaboration with the Quantitative BioSciences Institute (“QBI”) at UCSF, which received a $5 million cooperative agreement sponsored by DARPA, a research and development agency within the U.S. Department of Defense, we evaluated zotatifin as a potential host-directed anti-viral therapy in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Zotatifin inhibits the eIF4A-dependent translation of select mRNA into proteins. eIF4A is required to unwind the complex secondary structures within the 5’ UTR of coronaviruses, and other RNA viruses, to translate viral RNA and replicate. Zotatifin was evaluated as one of 69 compounds tested for in vitro antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (“SARS CoV-2”) the virus that causes COVID-19, by independent groups at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York and Institut Pasteur in Paris. Results from the study, published in Nature in April 2020, revealed that zotatifin was one of the most active antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 among all the compounds tested. In subsequent studies using normal human bronchoepithelial cells, zotatifin demonstrated potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 as well as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (“MERS-CoV”). Overall, these studies showed that zotatifin was approximately 10 times more potent than remdesivir or nirmatrelvir, two agents authorized by the FDA for treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. We’ve completed a Phase 1b double-blind, randomized dose escalation trial of zotatifin in non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 funded by DARPA in approximately 36 patients evaluating three different doses of zotatifin. In this trial, zotatifin was found to be safe and well-tolerated, and demonstrated favorable trends in several assessments of viral clearance compared to placebo. This trial began utilizing the same IV formulation currently being used in our cancer trials but switched to a newly developed sub-cutaneous formulation for the last 34 patients enrolled. Phamacokinetics results show a profile of drug concentrations in blood over time virtually identical to the IV formulation, suggesting the more convenient sub-cutaneous formulation could be used in future COVID or cancer trials. We have exhausted the full $5.0 million of allowable costs under our agreement with UCSF as of December 31, 2022.
 
eIF4E—Global Collaboration with Pfizer
Our third program is focused on developing inhibitors of eIF4E and is currently being developed by Pfizer under the Pfizer Agreement. Pfizer is currently conducting IND-enabling studies for the lead product candidate. We have received $42 million to date under the Pfizer Agreement with the potential to receive up to an additional $465 million in future milestone payments as well as potential royalties on sales.
Our Proprietary STRIs—Invented Using Our Translation Regulation Technology Platform
 
We discovered our product candidates using our proprietary selective translation regulation technology platform. In addition, we assembled a team of founders and collaborators that are experts in the eIF4F complex and growth-dependent translation control. The importance of translation regulation in disease has become increasingly recognized in the pharmaceutical industry, and we believe we remain at the forefront of developing approaches to cancer therapy focused on STRIs. Utilizing our proprietary selective translation regulation technology platform, we developed an understanding of genes that are translationally upregulated in multiple tumor types and other diseases. This has enabled us to identify specific points of therapeutic intervention that may have a meaningful clinical effect and to identify patient populations most likely to respond to product candidates acting at these points of intervention. We believe our in-depth understanding of translation regulation biology combined with our sophisticated and dedicated structure-based design and computational chemistry approach to medicinal chemistry gave us a key advantage in pioneering the emerging field of translation regulation therapeutics and creates significant barriers to entry. We currently plan to focus our resources on the clinical development of our existing product candidates.
 We have strong composition of matter and other intellectual property positions covering our product candidates and their uses and strive to protect our product candidates and our technology platform through an intellectual property estate in major markets throughout the world.
 
Strategy
 
Our goal is to continue to pioneer the development of and ultimately commercialize STRIs for the treatment of multiple types of cancer. To achieve our goal, we intend to pursue the following strategies:
•Advance our lead product candidate, tomivosertib, through clinical development and regulatory approval. We are currently enrolling patients in KICKSTART, a randomized Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating tomivosertib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic NSCLC, including patients with PD-L1 expression ≥50% in the frontline setting. We expect to report topline data from the KICKSTART trial in the second half of 2023. If we obtain positive results from this Phase 2b clinical trial, we plan to follow this trial with subsequent Phase 3 registration trials, with the ultimate goal of securing marketing approval in order to enable treatment of cancer patients for whom current treatments are inadequate. We also plan to further expand our clinical development program with tomivosertib in additional tumor types.
 •Develop zotatifin in patients with selected breast cancer and NSCLC tumors. We plan to advance our clinical trials of zotatifin in patients who we believe could most benefit from zotatifin’s potential ability to downregulate multiple disease-driving proteins in the PI3K-AKT and RAS-MEK pathways and key resistance proteins. We plan to initially focus on patients with breast cancer and NSCLC, tumor types potentially having more than one oncogenic driver downregulated by zotatifin. We are currently evaluating zotatifin in combination with fulvestrant and abemaciclib in a Phase 2a open-label expansion cohort in patients with ER+ breast cancer. In light of the favorable safety results observed to date, we have also resumed dose escalation of zotatifin in combination with fulvestrant in patients with ER+ breast cancer to determine if a higher dose of zotatifin can be utilized in future clinical studies. Our goal is to progress zotatifin through registrational trials to provide a novel treatment to patients not sufficiently benefitting from existing therapies.
 •Efficiently assess zotatifin’s utility as an antiviral in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and pursue additional development as appropriate. We have completed a Phase 1b double-blind, randomized dose escalation trial of zotatifin in non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 in approximately 36 patients evaluating three different doses of zotatifin. In this trial, zotatifin was found to be safe and well-tolerated, and demonstrated favorable trends in several assessments of viral clearance compared to placebo. While we believe the data generated from this trial warrant progression of the COVID program into later-stage development, we are focused on developing our assets in oncology and do not currently plan to pursue further development in COVID unless we secure a non-dilutive source of funding.
 •Selectively evaluate opportunities to maximize the potential of our programs in collaboration with leading biopharmaceutical companies. We retain worldwide rights to tomivosertib and zotatifin and 


plan to build the capabilities to effectively commercialize and market these product candidates for the treatment of cancer in North America, if approved. We plan to selectively evaluate potential opportunities on a program-by-program basis with biopharmaceutical companies whose research, development, and/or geographic capabilities complement our own with the goal to help mitigate clinical and commercial risk and/or maximize global commercial potential, including with respect to tomivosertib and zotatifin in markets outside of North America. For example, in December 2019, we entered into our research collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer for the development of our eIF4E program.
 •Maintain our corporate culture as we continue to grow our business. We believe that our environment of scientific and intellectual integrity, combined with a focus on respect, collaboration and a commitment to patients will be essential for our continued success. We plan to continue to foster this culture as we progress our pipeline through clinical development.

Role of Translational Regulations and the eIF4F Complex in Cancer
 
Figure 2: The process of gene expression.
 
The information embodied in the human genome directs cellular behavior through a process known as gene expression, whereby the instructions encoded in RNA are used to direct protein synthesis. Two critical steps in gene expression are transcription and translation (see figure 2 above). Transcription is the copying of DNA sequences into mRNA, whereas translation is the subsequent utilization of mRNA sequences to direct protein synthesis. Ever since a unidirectional flow of information from DNA to RNA to protein was named the central dogma of molecular biology by Francis Crick 60 more than years ago, biologists have focused on transcription as the primary point of regulation in gene expression. More recently, we and our scientific founders have demonstrated that translation serves as a critical regulatory step for overproduction of a small fraction of proteins in a cell and is amenable to drug development. Translational regulation typically controls the expression of functionally related proteins that can have profound effects on cellular physiology, including response to extracellular and intracellular signals that drive cellular growth and division and immune cell function. Disruption of the translational regulation of these effector proteins’ expression can drive the initiation and advancement of many diseases.
In cancer, the tightly controlled translation of certain mRNA frequently becomes dysregulated, via aberrant activation of the eIF4F complex, leading to the production of cancer-causing proteins and thus malignancy characterized by uncontrolled growth, immune evasion and metastasis. We believe our therapeutic approach can

restore the translational control of processes that tumors have hijacked for their benefit, while preserving normal cell function. Translationally regulated processes occur in tumor cells and T cells and are important for the survival and growth of tumors, including evasion of the body’s immune system. By acting in tumor cells and/or T cells, our product candidates can regulate production of many proteins that drive cancer progression and thus have the potential to combine the benefits of multiple targeted therapies and/or immunotherapies in a single therapeutic agent.
We have discovered that multiple processes responsible for attenuating an immune response, including upregulating checkpoint proteins and downregulating antigen presenting proteins, are controlled through translational regulation. The ability to attenuate an immune response is important in healthy tissue in order to maintain a balanced, non-self-destructive tenor following immune activation, but can also enable tumors to escape immune detection and destruction. By reprogramming T cells and blocking the translation of factors that allow tumors to escape immune mediated destruction, we believe we can release a patient’s immune system to more efficiently attack tumors.
 The eIF4F complex is a central junction where two of the most frequently mutated signaling pathways in cancer, the PI3K-AKT and RAS-MEK pathways, converge and represents a central node responsible for the translation of select mRNA into proteins that are frequent culprits in key disease-driving processes (see figure 3 below). Furthermore, continuous activation of MNK and the eIF4F complex in T cells leads to exhaustion and dysfunction. Our proprietary selective translation regulation technology platform has demonstrated that certain disease states, such as cancer, result in substantial upregulation of MNK and the eIF4F complex, which collectively activate production of multiple oncoproteins that drive tumor growth and proliferation, as well as immunosuppressive proteins that cause exhaustion and dysfunction in T cells. These disease-driving proteins are controlled by key translation regulation factors, including our three targets: MNK, eIF4A and eIF4E. MNK is a kinase that plays an important role in signaling and survival and regulate genes known to reduce, or downregulate, tumor immune response. MNK is the terminal kinase that phosphorylates eIF4E, a key component of the complex responsible for translation initiation, while eIF4A is responsible for unwinding mRNA structures prior to translation. We have discovered that MNK, eIF4A and eIF4E each selectively regulate the translation of a largely unique subset of mRNA providing the opportunity to impact distinct facets of tumor biology and disease subsets with each target in our portfolio.
 
Figure 3: eFFECTOR’s targets are located at a key node between oncogenic signaling pathways and the proteins they produce.
 
Extracellular signals
 
We see a high potential for improved therapeutic outcomes by targeting key translation regulators in the eIF4F complex to treat cancer. We believe targeting these translational regulators to treat cancer will allow our product candidates to have a broader therapeutic impact on tumors relative to programs directed at inhibiting activity of a single translated protein. By regulating the expression of sets of functionally related proteins that drive both tumor growth as well as the body’s response to the tumor, our product candidates are designed to generate effects on both tumor and immune cells that we believe can address many of the limitations of current targeted or immunotherapies.



Our Development Programs
 
We are developing a portfolio of selective small molecule STRIs targeting the eIF4F complex that we believe have the potential to overcome some of the limitations of current targeted or immunotherapies in a number of significant cancer types for which current treatments are limited or unavailable.
Lead Product Candidate: Tomivosertib, a Potent and Highly Selective MNK Inhibitor
 
Tomivosertib Overview
 
Tomivosertib is an oral small molecule MNK inhibitor in development for the treatment of patients with solid tumors in combination with anti PD-(L)1 therapy. MNK activates the eIF4F complex and controls the production of multiple immune-suppressive factors in T cells including PD-1, PD-L1, TIM3, LAG3 and IL-10. Through inhibition of MNK, tomivosertib is designed to reprogram T cells to delay exhaustion and dysfunction, providing a greater ability to combat tumor cells. In our completed Phase 2a CPI-A clinical trial evaluating tomivosertib in combination with anti PD-(L)1 therapy, in 17 patients with NSCLC tomivosertib demonstrated the ability to substantially extend the mPFS in patients that were previously not responding to their anti PD-(L)1 therapies. In addition, as of study completion in September 2020, two of those 17 patients (12%) have confirmed PRs, one of which went on to achieve a confirmed CR, with a third showing 28% tumor regression. Tomivosertib was generally well tolerated in this clinical trial. Based on these results, in the second quarter of 2021 we initiated patient enrollment in KICKSTART, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b trial of tomivosertib combined with pembrolizumab, in patients with metastatic NSCLC. We anticipate reporting topline data from the KICKSTART trial in the second half of 2023.
Market Opportunity
 
Lung cancer is the second most common cancer (excluding skin cancer) in the United States, and the leading cause of cancer death. The National Cancer Institute estimates over 237,000 new cases of lung cancer occurred in 2022. NSCLC is the most common subtype of lung cancer, accounting for 82% of all lung cancer diagnoses. Currently, approximately 75% of patients with NSCLC have tumors that lack a specific actionable mutation that is potentially conducive to approved mutation-specific targeted-therapies, but these patients may be eligible for anti PD-(L)1 as their frontline treatment for metastatic NSCLC. In 2022, the worldwide market value for anti PD- (L)1 therapies was greater than $35 billion, of which nearly half accounted for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC. While checkpoint inhibitor treatment is very effective in patients for a variety of cancers, these agents are generally not curative, and a large majority of patients ultimately progress on their checkpoint inhibitor therapy, emphasizing the need for novel frontline combination treatments that may increase the proportion of patients that experience long term durable benefit, and delay progression in other patients. There are an estimated approximately 27,000 U.S. patients with metastatic NSCLC that have PD-L1 expression ≥50%, which we estimate represents a $4 billion market opportunity in the United States. We also believe tomivosertib can be used to treat patients with PD-L1 expression levels 1-49%, which we estimate to represent another $5 billion dollar market opportunity in the Unites States.
 
We believe that the PD-L1≥50% setting offers a substantial market opportunity in the United States and globally, and that there are many opportunities to expand the development of tomivosertib including other checkpoint responsive cancers, such as bladder cancer, renal cell carcinoma or MSI-H cancers.
 
Overview on Invention of Tomivosertib—A Highly Selective Inhibitor of MNK
 
We conducted an extensive medicinal chemistry effort incorporating structure-based drug design and identified tomivosertib as our lead product candidate. Tomivosertib has demonstrated highly potent and selective MNK inhibition, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (“IC50”), of one to two nanomolar (one billionth of a mole per liter) against each of the MNK isoforms, MNK1 and MNK2 in enzyme assays and inhibits the kinase through a reversible, ATP-competitive mechanism of action. Treatment of tumor cell lines with tomivosertib led to a dose-dependent reduction in eIF4E phosphorylation at serine 209 (IC50 = 1.4 to 21.5 nM), consistent with previous

findings that phosphorylation of this site is solely dependent upon MNK. Additionally, when tested in vitro against an enzyme panel of 414 kinases, tomivosertib was shown to be a highly selective inhibitor of MNK, with a potency against MNK approximately 100-fold greater than its potency against two of the profiled kinases, CLK4 and DRAK1, and more than 1000-fold greater than its potency against the remaining 412 kinase targets tested.
 Tomivosertib is designed to inhibit MNK and thus block phosphorylation of eIF4E and activation of the eIF4F complex downstream of MAPK signaling in T cells, and to selectively regulate protein translation of select mRNAs. We performed a comprehensive and quantitative measurement of the effect of tomivosertib inhibition on the translation of expressed mRNA in multiple tumor cell lines and immune cell types. In this study, MNK was shown to play an important role in regulating anti-tumor immune response by controlling the expression of key known immune checkpoint proteins and cytokines that create an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which together limit immune cell function.
We also tested tomivosertib in multiple in vivo tumor models, including syngeneic mouse models and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer conducted in immunocompetent mice, as well as multiple xenograft models comprising human tumor cells implanted in mice whose immune systems have been compromised in order to permit growth of human cells. Through this battery of in vivo preclinical tests, we have demonstrated that tomivosertib treatment as a single agent triggered a broad anti-tumor immune response in immunocompetent mouse models, including induction of anti-tumor immunity that persisted after tomivosertib dosing is stopped.
 
Tomivosertib Mechanism of Action: Stimulating the Immune System to Enhance Tumor Killing
 
Our preclinical and clinical data collected to date suggest combining tomivosertib with an anti PD-(L)1 inhibitor can overcome mechanisms of resistance to checkpoint inhibitors, resulting in enhanced sensitivity to checkpoint inhibitors. Our preclinical studies have shown that suppressing MNK broadly enhanced T cell effector response both in vivo and in vitro. Through its mechanism designed to reprogram T cells by blocking a pivotal intracellular signaling pathway, tomivosertib has been shown to:
 •enhance tumor cell killing;
 •downregulate several key checkpoint inhibitory proteins, including PD-1, PD-L1, TIM3 and LAG3;
 •decrease production of immunosuppressive IL-10, while maintaining immune-stimulatory interferon gamma; and
 •increase T cell central memory pool.
 In preclinical studies, tomivosertib at clinically relevant concentrations has been shown to downregulate multiple immunosuppressive proteins simultaneously, including PD-1, PD-L1, TIM3, LAG3 and IL-10, as shown in figure 4 below. Specifically, incubating increasing concentration of tomivosertib with activated primary human T cells showed dose-dependent suppression of multiple checkpoints associated with T cell exhaustion, reaching statistical significance (p<0.05) in the 0.1 to 1.0 Î¼µM range, coupled with maintenance of T cell viability and activation marker 4-1BB, an immune-stimulatory protein. Collectively, these experiments suggest that tomivosertib selectively reprogramed T cells resulting in robust effector target killing activity by suppressing exhaustion/ dysfunction properties.

To explore the molecular mechanism of downregulation, we conducted a study placing sequences of the LAG3 5’ UTR in a luciferase reporter assay and assessing for luciferase expression in T cells in the presence of increasing tomivosertib, which showed luciferase protein levels decrease as a function of tomivosertib concentration, reaching statistical significance (p<0.05) in the 10 Î¼µM and above range (see figure 5 below). Similar results were obtained using the 5’-UTR of PD-L1. When the 5’-UTR of tubulin, a control protein not involved in immunosuppression, was used to drive luciferase expression, tomivosertib had no effect.
 
Figure 5: Tomivosertib downregulates production of protein from luciferase, a reporter gene, placed downstream of the LAG3 5’ UTR.
 


To understand the impact of tomivosertib on T cell function, we utilized populations of mouse or human T cells engineered to recognize SIINFEKL, a peptide derived from ovalbumin, or the human protein CD19, respectively, as shown in figure 6 below. In mouse, stimulation of splenocytes comprised of the engineered T cells in the presence of increasing concentration of tomivosertib resulted in increased T cell central memory, as defined by cells with high expression of two markers CD44 and CD62L, and increased killing of target cells bearing the ovalbumin peptide. Likewise, stimulation of human engineered T cells targeting CD19 in the presence of increasing concentration of tomivosertib resulted in an increased pool of stem cell memory T cells, as defined by human surface markers CD45RA+CD27+ and increased killing of target cells expressing CD19.

Thus, treatment with tomivosertib has been shown to suppress production of multiple proteins and factors that lead to T cell exhaustion and dysfunction, increase the pool of memory T cells, and increase the killing of target cells by T cells.
Tomivosertib Has Been Shown to Trigger Immune Memory as a Single Agent and Enhanced antiPD-1 Activity in Preclinical Models
To demonstrate that the immune-enhancing properties of tomivosertib can lead to anti-tumor activity, we conducted a preclinical study in mice with intact immune systems and implanted them with syngeneic tumor CT26. These tumor-bearing mice were subsequently dosed with either tomivosertib, a mouse version of antiPD-1 antibody, or the combination of the two drugs (see figure 7 below). All dosing was conducted for 2 weeks. These experiments showed administration of either single agent tomivosertib or antiPD-1 therapy resulted in tumor reduction in about 50% relative to control untreated mice, whereas the combination of both resulted in full regression of the tumor in all mice treated. To demonstrate the role of immune memory, mice in each cohort that showed tumor regression were re-challenged with additional CT-26 tumor cells injected in the contralateral flank and in the absence of any further drug treatment. The results showed these mice, including those pretreated with single agent tomivosertib, and the combination of tomivosertib plus anti PD-L1, were able to reject subsequent tumor challenge, indicating enhancement of immune memory which was able to prevent growth of the newly implanted tumors. Further pharmacodynamic biomarkers in the CT26 models showed that tomivosertib treatment also resulted in enhanced intratumor ratio of effector CD8+, cytotoxic T cells, to FOXP3+, immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, and resulted in lowering immunosuppressive M2 macrophages within the tumor. Collectively, these data demonstrate that tomivosertib potentiated the immune system and resulted in durable inhibition of tumor growth. A recent

publication by independent investigators at McGill University also showed that blocking MNK resulted in robust immune activation and tumor regressions across several mice models of melanoma (JCI, 2021) by further activating T cells and other immune cells.
 
Figure 7: Preclinical studies show that tomivosertib plus an anti-PD-1 inhibitor resulted in regressions in all animals and persisting immune memory upon a tumor rechallenge even as a single agent.
 


Tomivosertib Acts on Multiple Cell Types That Drive Immune Response
 Our data as well as recent data from McGill University suggest that blocking MNK on multiple immune cell types broadly engages the immune system to kill cancer cells (see figure 8 below). These mechanisms that drive immune activity include: (1) downregulating multiple checkpoint proteins and immunosuppressive cytokines on T cells; (2) increasing antigen presentation on dendritic cells; (3) increasing cytotoxic function of CD8+T cells and blocking T cell exhaustion/dysfunction; and (4) expanding T cell memory pools. Collectively, these effects may complement checkpoint inhibitors by increasing tumor recognition, restoring immune response, improving durability of response and preserving immune persistence.
 
Figure 8: Tomivosertib designed to act on multiple cell types that drive immune response.
 


Based on these findings, we believe tomivosertib has the potential to improve current immunological treatments for cancer by extending the benefit that patients experience with checkpoint inhibitors and restoring benefit to patients who have stopped responding to checkpoint inhibitors.
 
Phase 1 Dose Escalation Trial in Cancer Patients and Food Effect Study in Healthy Volunteers
 
We conducted two independent Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trials in solid tumors and lymphoma, respectively, to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tumor control of tomivosertib. The primary endpoint of each trial was to establish MTD and determine a recommended Phase 2 dose (“RP2D”).
 In our solid tumor Phase 1 dose escalation trial, we enrolled patients with any metastatic solid tumor who had progressed on standard of care therapies. From this trial we established the RP2D as 200 mg twice daily (“BID”), in

a capsule formulation taken while fasted, and we subsequently conducted our Phase 2a CPI-A study using this dosing regimen. We also found that tomivosertib monotherapy treatment was generally well-tolerated in this patient population. The most frequent treatment-emergent AEs were nausea, vomiting, fatigue, constipation, dyspepsia and tremor. At doses that exceeded the RP2D, there was a higher incidence and severity of these AEs. The overall pharmacokinetic exposure showed increase as a function of dose with a half-life of approximately 12 hours, supporting a BID regimen.
 In our lymphoma Phase 1 dose escalation trial, we enrolled patients with B cell malignancies, predominantly patients with lymphoma, who had progressed on standard of care therapies. This trial initially tested safety in two dose levels, 300 mg or 450 mg once daily (“QD”) and 200 mg BID or 300 mg BID, followed by limited expansion at the RP2D, 200 mg BID capsule. In this study, we established the MTD as 200 mg BID capsules taken fasted. The most common AEs experienced by patients in the RP2D expansion cohort were nausea, vomiting, hypercalcemia, and fatigue. One patient who received the capsule formulation at 200 mg BID achieved a confirmed PR, or a confirmed decrease in tumor size by at least 50%, per the Lugano criteria for lymphoma, determined from a scan after treatment as compared to the immediately prior scan (see figure 9 below). This patient had previously experienced a radiographic progression on R-CHOP (chemotherapy combination regimen of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and autologous stem cell transplant. Eight patients experienced stable disease, meaning their tumor assessments remained within the established boundaries for lymphoma of +/- 50% from baseline with no appearance of new lesions, with several of those patients demonstrating initial decreased tumor volume. Of 19 patients enrolled, 13 were radiographically evaluable with at least one on-treatment scan. Their overall best response is shown in Figure 9 below.
 
Figure 9: Phase 1 dose escalation trial included multiple patients with tumor regressions.
 


In addition, the pharmacodynamics in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as in pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies showed that phospho-eIF4E, a marker of MNK inhibition, was effectively inhibited at the RP2D. At the RP2D, we observed 90 to 100% inhibition of the MNK target as measured by phospho-eIF4E immunohistochemistry (“IHC”) from pre- and on-treatment biopsies samples (see figure 10 below).
 

Figure 10: Marker of MNK activation is down regulated in tumors as shown from a patient’s biopsy samples
 


We also completed two healthy volunteer food effect studies in healthy volunteers in order to evaluate the pharmacokinetic distribution of tomivosertib under either fasted or fed conditions. These were single-dose crossover studies evaluating drug exposure in the same patients at either of two different doses of tomivosertib, 100 mg or 200 mg, each taken with or without food. The results of these studies determined that food increased blood exposure concentration of tomivosertib by approximately two-fold, demonstrating that exposure of tomivosertib at 100 mg taken with food is comparable to 200 mg taken without food. To facilitate patient convenience moving forward, the RP2D for tomivosertib will be 100 mg BID taken with food starting within our Phase 2b KICKSTART trial.
 
Phase 2a Trial of Tomivosertib in Combination with Checkpoint Inhibitors
 
We conducted a Phase 2a CPI-A trial which evaluated tomivosertib in subjects who had initiated anti PD- (L)1 monotherapy and were not responding, that is had either developed progressive disease (“PD”), per RECIST criteria on their therapy, or a greater than 20% increase in target tumor size, or had undergone ≥12 weeks of anti PD-(L)1 therapy with no evidence of a PR or CR. We enrolled a total of 39 patients in this trial with diverse tumor types and any prior anti PD-(L)1 therapy approved by the FDA for the indication it was prescribed. Among these, 17 patients had a primary cancer type of NSCLC with advancing metastatic disease, on their anti PD-(L)1 therapy, including 16 of 17 who met the RECIST criteria for PD, prior to the addition of tomivosertib. Per our protocol, subjects continued their anti PD-(L)1 therapy according to their package insert, without a break in treatment schedule, and then initiated tomivosertib at 200 mg BID taken fasted 7 days prior to their next scheduled anti PD-(L)1 therapy. The primary objectives of this trial were to evaluate safety and antitumor activity, as measured by PFS and ORR. Overall, treatment with tomivosertib in combination with anti PD-(L)1 therapy was generally well tolerated. The AEs that occurred were generally consistent with the AE profiles of tomivosertib and anti PD-(L)1 therapy each as monotherapies. The most common AEs were nausea, fatigue, tremor, vomiting, and increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, which are two metabolic enzymes whose levels in blood are tracked as a measure of liver function. These AEs were generally grade 1 or 2 in severity.
 
In the Phase 2a study, 87% (34 of 39) of subjects experienced an adverse event potentially related to tomivosertib. The most common adverse events occurring in >20% of subjects and related to tomivosertib included: nausea, experienced by 16 (41.0%) subjects; tremor experienced by 15 (38.5%) subjects; fatigue experienced by 11 (28.2%) subjects, and vomiting experienced by 9 (23.1%) subjects. In the Phase 2a study, 28% of study subjects experienced a Grade 3 adverse event potentially related to tomivosertib. No specific Grade >3 adverse events potentially related to tomivosertib were experienced. The following Grade 3 adverse events potentially related to tomivosertib were experienced by two patients: alanine aminotransferase increase, blood creatinine phosphokinase (a metabolic enzyme whose levels in blood are assessed as a potential indicator of drug effects on muscle tissue) increase, and rash.
 Of the total 39 patients enrolled, three (7.7%) patients had confirmed PRs, or decreases in tumor assessments of greater than or equal to 30% per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Of the patients with confirmed PRs, two had NSCLC and one had renal cell carcinoma. In addition, there was only one patient enrolled with gastric cancer and that patient had a 66% reduction of their target lesion upon addition of tomivosertib. One of five patients (20%) who enrolled with renal cell carcinoma had a confirmed PR. In the 17 patients with NSCLC, tomivosertib substantially extended the mPFS in patients that were previously progressing on their anti PD-(L)1 therapies. In addition, as of study completion in September 2020, two of those 17 NSCLC patients (12%) had confirmed PRs, one of which went on to achieve a confirmed CR after study completion, with a third showing 28% tumor regression. The patients with NSCLC generally had multiple treatments prior to coming on to study, with a median of two prior therapies, and 16

of the 17 (94%) NSCLC patients had RECIST progression on PD-(L)1 immediately prior to the addition of tomivosertib, and the other patient had a 13% increase in tumor size that was not classified as a RECIST progression. The mPFS in the 17 NSCLC patients was 20 weeks (see figure 11 below). Further, the mPFS in patients known to have PD-L1 expression level greater than 1% ("PD-L1>1%"), suggestive of an immune-responsive tumor, was 53 weeks. From our database, patients were either characterized as PD-L1=0, PD-L1>1% or PD-L1 unknown. As a comparison, in the Phase 3 OAK trial, which led to the FDA approval of atezolizumab, an inhibitor of PD-L1, in second line plus treatment of NSCLC patients, the average benefit of patients (n =168) treated beyond initial RECIST progression with continued treatment with atezolizumab was approximately 7 weeks. Thus, the benefit observed after the addition of tomivosertib in patients with NSCLC was nearly three-times greater relative to a historical comparator. Additionally, when vibostolimab, an agent directed against TIGIT, another immunosuppressive checkpoint protein, was added to pembrolizumab in patients who had progressed on pembrolizumab, a mPFS of 9 weeks was observed. However, because tomivosertib was not studied in head-to-head clinical trials with these agents, such data may not be directly comparable due to differences in study protocols, conditions and patient populations.
 
Figure 11. Swimmers plot showing length of time on tomivosertib plus anti PD-(L)1 combination therapy in NSCLC.
 


An important aspect of tomivosertib’s activity in the P2a trial is its demonstrated ability to change the trajectory of tumor growth in patients that were already progressing on their anti PD-(L)1 therapy prior to the addition of tomivosertib. As shown in figure 12 below, most patients either stabilized or had their target tumor lesions regress upon the addition of tomivosertib, and 9 of the 17 (53%) patients experienced an extension of their PFS for at least 6 months which is generally believed to be clinically meaningful.
 

Figure 12: Spider plot showing trajectory of target tumor lesions after tomivosertib added to anti-PD(L)1 monotherapy.
 


As diagrammed in figure 13 below, one of our patients with NSCLC experienced a confirmed PR through approximately 80 weeks on our P2a trial before the trial was closed. This patient continued treatment with the combination of tomivosertib and pembrolizumab under an investigator sponsored compassionate use protocol after our trial ended, and subsequently experienced a confirmed CR, meaning a complete response confirmed on two scans, after a total of approximately 24 months on the combination therapy. This patient was PD-L1>50%.
 
Figure 13: Tumor trajectory of patient who experienced a confirmed complete response with the combination of tomivosertib and pembrolizumab after two years on the combination therapy.
 


In our Phase 2a trial, patients known to have tumors that express biomarker PD-L1 showed a preferential treatment response relative to those patients known to have tumors that exhibited no PD-L1 expression. To assess the impact of PD-L1 status, a known marker for sensitivity to anti PD-(L)1 therapy in NSCLC, on the benefit of adding tomivosertib, we conducted a post hoc Kaplan Meier (KM) analysis of PFS in patients positive for PD-L1 compared to patients negative for this marker. PD-L1 status was available for 14 of the 17 patients. The KM analysis showed that PD-L1-positive patients had a three times lower hazard ratio, or risk of progressing, after addition of

tomivosertib compared to PD-L1-negative patients (see figure 14 below). We believe this correlation is consistent with tomivosertib’s mechanism of reversing T cell exhaustion and re-invigorating the immune system, and we are excluding PD-L1 negative patients from our Phase 2b KICKSTART trial. In contrast to the impact of PD-L1 status on tomivosertib treatment, in the treatment beyond progression cohort of the OAK study of atezolizumab monotherapy, PD-L1 status was not correlated with response, suggesting that exclusion of PD-L1 negative patients may differentially enhance response in the tomivosertib plus pembrolizumab arm compared to the placebo plus pembrolizumab arm in our Phase 2b KICKSTART trial.

KICKSTART—A Randomized Phase 2b Trial Evaluating PD-L1≥50%

We are currently enrolling patients with metastatic NSCLC in KICKSTART, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial, as illustrated in figure 15 below. We are conducting this trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of tomivosertib to frontline pembrolizumab treatment in NSCLC patients with PD-L1≥50%. In the KICKSTART trial, patients without prior treatment for metastatic NSCLC, including no prior anti PD-(L)1 treatment, will be randomized 1:1 to receive tomivosertib plus pembrolizumab or placebo plus pembrolizumab. Previously, we were also enrolling into a front-line extension cohort, treating patients who had progressed on pembrolizumab monotherapy as well as a maintenance cohort, treating patients with PD-L1>1% who initiated frontline therapy with pembrolizumab combined with platinum-based chemotherapy doublet, immediately after completing the platinum-based phase (4-6 cycles) of their frontline treatment without disease progression. We discontinued enrollment into the front-line extension cohort in part based on our belief that frontline treatment with a single immunotherapy agent such as pembrolizumab will diminish in the future, coupled with the fact that enrollment into this cohort was slower than anticipated. Enrollment was slower than anticipated, in part due to physician reluctance to expose patients after initial progression to a control group with continued treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy, and in part due to the impact of COVID-19 on clinical site operations. In addition, we discontinued enrollment into the maintenance cohort due to slower than anticipated enrollment resulting from staffing issues across clinical sites, competition from other trials and patient reluctance to enroll in a clinical trial immediately after completing chemotherapy.
 
Enrollment challenges have persisted in the PD-L1≥50% cohort, and we recently updated our anticipated topline data readout to the second half of 2023. We believe that factors contributing to slower enrollment include the impact of COVID-19 on site operations and a greater than anticipated use of chemotherapy in combination with pembrolizumab as frontline therapy, especially at certain sites that may not always assess PD-L1 status prior to initiating therapy. We have taken several steps to mitigate these factors, including increasing our recruiting and patient identification activities, optimizing the number of sites and continuing emphasis on the importance of PD-L1 testing to select optimal frontline therapy, especially for patients with PD-L1 ≥50% who may be spared the challenges of chemotherapy. We believe these efforts, combined with our patient and physician outreach activities, will enhance enrollment.
 

We plan to enroll approximately 60 patients in the KICKSTART trial and the primary endpoint is PFS. In addition, OS and ORR will be assessed as secondary endpoints. If we obtain positive results from this Phase 2b clinical trial, we plan to follow this trial with subsequent Phase 3 registration trials.

SU2C Breast Cancer Trial
 
Tomivosertib has also been tested in a single-arm Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer in combination with chemotherapy in a study led by Dr. Nahum Sonenberg of McGill University. We supplied tomivosertib capsules for this trial and all other costs were fully funded through a grant from Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C) Canada. The group initially planned to enroll up to 40 patients with metastatic breast cancer for whom approved and available therapies were not effective in controlling the cancer. Tomivosertib was administered in combination with paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel. The primary objectives of this trial were to assess safety and tolerability of tomivosertib as monotherapy and in combination with paclitaxel, and to assess pharmacodynamic effects as an indication of biological activity of tomivosertib treatment. The group elected to enroll only 19 patients, which the investigators believe will be sufficient to report positive pharmacodynamic data.
Additional Exploratory Tomivosertib Trials in Solid Tumors
Tomivosertib was evaluated in several additional Phase 2a trials prior to our CPI-A and KICKSTART trials. In 2019, we completed a combination trial with avelumab, an inhibitor of PD-L1, in patients with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (“MSS CRC”), through a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Pfizer and Merck KGaA. MSS CRC is generally not responsive to immunologic agents. We enrolled 55 patients in this trial including an initial 10 patients in the dose escalation portion of tomivosertib combined with the standard of care dose of avelumab, 15 patients who initially received tomivosertib as monotherapy and were allowed an option to crossover to a combination of tomivosertib and avelumab, and 30 patients who received the combination of tomivosertib and avelumab. Tomivosertib was generally well tolerated in combination with avelumab at 200 mg BID, taken fasted, as the RP2D. We observed one confirmed PR and 25% of the patients remained on study for >12 weeks in this typically immune-refractory patient population. However, based on tomivosertib’s mechanism of action, we elected to focus future development of tomivosertib on more immune-responsive cancers. Prior to this trial, we enrolled 16 patients in a monotherapy trial treating castration resistant prostate cancer (“CRPC”). We observed no PRs or CRs in this CRPC trial and seven of the 16 (44%) patients experienced SD. We stopped this trial due to limited activity and to focus on further development in combination with checkpoint inhibitors.
 
Zotatifin—A Potent and Selective eIF4A mRNA Helicase Inhibitor
 
Zotatifin Overview
 
Our second product candidate in clinical development, zotatifin, is a small molecule inhibitor of eIF4A, a subunit of the eIF4F complex that regulates translation of cell proliferation proteins which can be oncogenic drivers

in cancer. eIF4A is a helicase responsible for unwinding complex mRNA secondary structures found in the 5’ UTR of select mRNA, allowing efficient ribosome binding and subsequent translation of mRNA into important proteins. Zotatifin is designed to downregulate multiple oncoproteins, several of which are up-regulated as part of well-characterized feed-back pathways causing resistance to specific targeted therapies. Our preclinical experiments show zotatifin has the potential to both work as a single agent or in combination with several targeted therapies to prevent resistance, including in important indications such as several breast cancer tumor types and KRAS mutant NSCLC. We are currently evaluating zotatifin in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with solid tumors. We are currently evaluating patients in multiple open-label expansion cohorts in biomarker-positive patients with tumors driven by multiple proteins shown in our preclinical studies to be downregulated by zotatifin. To date, we’ve reported initial data from four cohorts including patients with ER+ breast cancer, which demonstrated that zotatifin appeared to be safe, well tolerated and showed signals of activity, including partial responses in heavily pretreated ER+ breast cancer patients. We anticipate reporting additional data from one of the ER+ breast cancer cohorts which was expanded from seven to 18 patients in the first half of 2023. In addition, based on the safety results and target engagement data generated to date, we’ve resumed dose escalation. Data from the dose escalation portion of the trial is anticipated in the second half of 2023.
 
Market Opportunity
 
The National Cancer Institute estimates that in the United States over 287,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer and over 237,000 new cases of lung cancer occurred in 2022. ER+ breast cancer represents approximately 60% or more of all breast cancers and NSCLC is the most common subtype of lung cancer, accounting for 82% of all lung cancer diagnoses. KRAS mutant lung cancer is estimated to represent about 25% of NSCLC. In metastatic ER+ breast cancer, patients are currently typically treated with inhibitors of estrogen receptor (“ER”) and CDK4/6, but most patients eventually progress. Thus, there is a need for improved therapies. In KRAS mutant lung cancer, targeting KRAS G12C mutation subtype with selective inhibitor, two agents have received approval by the FDA, however, resistance is emerging and this agent is not effective against other KRAS mutation subtypes such as G12A, G12D or G12V.
We are currently focusing development of zotatifin in ER+ metastatic breast cancer. Based on our preclinical studies, we believe that a combination of zotatifin with an ER inhibitor, such as fulvestrant, may be able to treat patients with ER+ breast cancer, representing about 42,000 patients annually in the U.S. Fulvestrant is generic and marketed by several companies including Astrazeneca who markets it under the brand name Faslodex for the treatment of breast cancer. Furthermore, we believe a triple combination of zotatifin with fulvestrant and a CDK4/6 inhibitor may provide even greater activity. Currently marketed CDK4/6 inhibitors include abemaciclib (Verenzio), palbociclib (Ibrance) and ribociclib (KISQALI). We also believe that zotatifin could be active in other subsets of breast cancer, including FGFR+ and HER2+ subgroups. FGFR2 and HER2 are RTKs, important proteins driving cancer. Inhibitors of multiple RTKs are available on the market today such as inhibitors of HER2, EGFR and FGFR. However, challenges remain with emergent resistance to individual RTK inhibitors through either mutation or upregulated production of RTKs and/or downstream effector proteins. Based on preclinical data, zotatifin has single agent activity against certain ER+ breast cancers that also have mutations in either HER2 or FGFR, which we estimate combined total approximately 17,000 patients.
 In NSCLC, we plan to develop zotatifin KRAS mutant NSCLC as either a single agent or in combination with targeted agents such as those inhibiting KRAS G12C.KRAS activating mutations occur in approximately 25% of patients with NSCLC and there are limited drugs available to treat these patients. There are multiple activating mutation subtypes of KRAS, including G12A, G12C, G12D and G12V, and we estimate there are 28,000 KRAS mutant NSCLC patients in the U.S.
 
Overview of Invention of Zotatifin—Persistent Chemistry Effort Incorporating a Natural Product as a Design
 Element
The discovery process that led to the identification of zotatifin as a clinical candidate began with a core pharmacophore found in silvestrol and rocaglamide A (“Roc A”), two natural products that have shown interesting biological activities but lack certain drug-like properties. We undertook a sophisticated and comprehensive computational analysis of available information, including a crystal structure of Roc A bound to eIF4A and RNA. Additionally, we used mutational analysis to identify critical amino acids in eIF4A required for binding, and structure-activity relationships amongst our early program compounds, to identify a preferred orientation of certain

substituents on the core pharmacophore. These insights enabled an efficient process whereby we limited synthesis and testing to compounds with a high chance of retaining strong affinity for eIF4A. This allowed us to focus our resources on a persistent discovery plan conferring drug-like properties to mature program compounds.
 
Zotatifin Mechanism of Action: Downregulating Multiple Disease-Driving Proteins in One Pill
 
eIF4A is a catalytic subunit of the eIF4F complex that regulates translation of cell proliferation proteins which can be oncogenic drivers in cancer. eIF4A is a helicase and is responsible for unwinding complex secondary structures found in the 5’ UTR of select mRNA. This unwinding is a regulatory control step that leads to efficient production of important proteins that enable normal cells to respond to growth signals, and which are upregulated in tumor cells.
 As shown in figure 16 below, eIF4A is a located at a central node at the intersection where two important cell growth and proliferation pathways, the PI3K-AKT and RAS-MEK pathways, converge to activate the translation of select messenger mRNA into proteins that are frequent culprits in key disease-driving processes. eIF4A regulates production of multiple growth-dependent proteins involved in cell growth, proliferation and survival. Many of these proteins are oncogenic drivers and often upregulated in cancer. Proteins in tumor cells that are controlled by eIF4A include:
(1) multiple oncoproteins for which targeted therapies such as ER, HER2, FGFR and KRAS G12C are approved by the FDA;
(2) oncoproteins for which there are currently no targeted therapies available, such as MYC and Cyclin D1; and
 (3) certain proteins that are often upregulated in response to targeted therapies as a resistance mechanism, such as Cyclin D1, CDK4/6, RTKs and KRAS.
 Several of these oncoproteins can function in concert within a vertical signaling pathway to drive tumor growth, proliferation and survival in cancer, including certain breast cancers and NSCLC. Simultaneously inhibiting more than one oncoprotein in a vertical signaling pathway and/or set of cooperating pathways has become recognized as a generalizable way to approach cancer therapy. Because zotatifin simultaneously regulates multiple oncoproteins in the same vertical signaling pathways, as well as set of cooperating pathways, this may potentially lead to single agent activity. In addition, by combining with another targeted therapy acting within the same pathway, zotatifin has the potential to augment inhibition of multiple oncogenic drivers to deepen or broaden the response to zotatifin and complementary agents. Resistance to these targeted therapies can occur via upregulation of both the protein which is being targeted as well as other pathway proteins also regulated by eIF4A.
 

Figure 16: eIF4A is a key node that is activated by multiple RTKs and KRAS and controls production of many cancer driving proteins.
 


As illustrated in figure 17 below, we discovered that most proteins inhibited by zotatifin have common distinct translation initiation regulatory elements in the 5’ UTR of the mRNA that are recognized by zotatifin. These common regulatory elements are found in the mRNA of multiple key oncoproteins that drive cancer. In addition, many of these proteins are over-expressed in response to targeted therapies, leading to drug resistance. Importantly, our preclinical data showed that zotatifin inhibition in physiologic concentrations in vitro only impacted translation of approximately 5% of mRNAs in a cell, indicating that global protein synthesis is unaffected at these concentrations. Further, because these translation initiation regulatory elements are located in the mRNA prior to and independent from the coding sequences that dictate the amino acids included in protein synthesis, their inhibition is independent of protein mutation variants. For example, in preclinical studies, zotatifin inhibited production of KRAS across multiple activating mutation subtypes such as G12C, G12V and G12D due to their common translation initiation regulatory elements.
 

Figure 17: Zotatifin is selective for proteins that drive tumor growth and resistance.
 


Preclinical Studies with Zotatifin
 
Preclinical experiments showed that zotatifin was most active in models with either two or more select oncogenic drivers that are directly downregulated by zotatifin. In addition, preclinical models have also demonstrated zotatifin’s tumor growth inhibition activity in combination with drugs that target specific protein in the same vertical pathways, such as inhibitors of HER2, FGFR, AKT or PI3K, or in combination with drugs against targets that are activated by these pathways such as ER and CDK4/6. There are no currently available drugs that directly target Cyclin D1 or MYC and we believe zotatifin may be an attractive drug candidate in cancers driven by these proteins.
 
We believe the potential of zotatifin to downregulate multiple disease-driving proteins involved in specific breast cancer tumor types, including ER, Cyclin D1, CDK4/6 FGFR, and HER2, may provide an important treatment option for patients with these tumor types. In our preclinical studies, zotatifin demonstrated efficacy in several mice models of breast cancers. For example, in the MDA-MB-361, ER+HER2+PIK3CA mutant, model of breast cancer, treatment with either zotatifin or palbociclib, an inhibitor of CDK4/6, resulted in comparable efficacy. Interestingly, co-treatment with both zotatifin and palbociclib together showed strong combination activity with tumor regressions persisting for more than 40 days after dosing with the combination had stopped (see figure 18 below). In multiple preclinical models, zotatifin downregulates production of Cyclin D1. Upregulation of free Cyclin D1 has been shown to promote resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition and, therefore, we believe a combination of zotatifin with a CDK4/6 inhibitor has the potential to be a promising treatment option for patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer.

Across a panel of approximately 100 cell lines evaluated, zotatifin treatment resulted in apoptosis in many lines harboring activating KRAS mutation. Furthermore, in cell proliferation and apoptosis assays, zotatifin showed strong activity in combination with a KRAS G12C inhibitor produced by Amgen, known as AMG510 or sotorasib, which recently received regulatory approval. We believe that zotatifin has the potential to overcome mechanisms of resistance to inhibitors of KRAS G12C by downregulating Cyclin D1 and certain RTKs, as well as inhibiting de novo KRAS protein production. Our preclinical studies showed that in models of NCI-H1792 KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC, zotatifin had similar tumor growth inhibition activity as AMG510. This preclinical data also showed that the combination of zotatifin and AMG510 led to tumor regressions in almost all animals tested (see figure 19 below). In preclinical models of KRAS mutant tumors, zotatifin downregulated KRAS, Cyclin D1 and several RTKs. Upregulation of these proteins has been shown to promote resistance to KRAS inhibition and, therefore, we believe a combination of zotatifin with a KRAS inhibitor has the potential to be a promising treatment option for patients with KRASG12C NSCLC.

Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial Observations and Plans
 
We are evaluating zotatifin in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with certain solid tumors. We completed the initially planned dose escalation portion of this trial and are currently evaluating patients in multiple open-label expansion cohorts in patients with solid tumors driven by multiple proteins shown in our preclinical studies to be downregulated by zotatifin. The primary objectives of the Phase 1 portion of the trial included assessing safety and selecting a RP2D of zotatifin administered intravenously (“IV”). In the initial Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the trial, we enrolled 37 patients at doses ranging from 0.005 mg/kg IV weekly to 0.1 mg/kg IV weekly including modified regimens of two weeks on treatment followed by one week off treatment. During dose escalation we observed three DLTs, including one DLT of grade 2 thrombocytopenia that prevented the completion of continued therapy throughout the DLT window observed in the 0.035 mg/kg IV weekly cohort and two DLTs observed in the 0.1 mg/kg IV weekly administered two weeks on and one week off cohort. One patient experienced a DLT of grade 3 anemia and another patient experienced a DLT of grade 3 gastrointestinal bleed in the setting of grade 2 thrombocytopenia. Based on this data, we concluded that the 0.1 mg/ kg dose exceeded the MTD. Overall AEs across all dose levels included predominantly Grade 1 and Grade 2 nausea, vomiting and anemia. Zotatifin exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetic exposure and had a relatively long half-life of approximately four days. At doses of 0.035 mg/kg and above, zotatifin has achieved exposures in blood in humans that correspond to levels resulting in preclinical activity in mice studies.


In June 2021, based on an evaluation of data from the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of zotatifin, we selected 0.07 mg/kg given on Day 1 and Day 8 of a 21-day cycle, a dose and schedule at which we observed no DLTs, as the RP2D.
We initiated clinical evaluation of zotatifin in Phase 2a indication-specific expansion cohorts. The primary objectives of the Phase 2a cohorts are to further characterize safety and to identify initial signals of efficacy in biomarker-specific patient populations. We initiated four expansion cohorts, three in mBC and one in NSCLC. Specifically, we initiated cohorts evaluating zotatifin as a monotherapy treatment in ER+/FGFR+ mBC, as a combination with fulvestrant, an FDA-approved inhibitor of ER, in ER+ mBC, as a combination with fulvestrant and abemaciclib, an FDA-approved inhibitor of CDK4/6, in ER+/HER2- mBC, and as a combination with sotorasib, an FDA approved KRAS inhibitor, in KRAS G12C NSCLC. Each of our Phase 2a expansion cohorts were structured as a Simon’s Two Stage design in which seven patients would be enrolled in the first stage of the trial and assessed for activity prior to advancing to the second stage of the trial.
 In June 2022, we reported interim data from four of the ongoing Phase 2a expansion cohorts. As of the March 4, 2022 cutoff date, the interim results showed that zotatifin was generally well tolerated at the .07 kg/mg dose and treatment emergent adverse events ("TEAEs") related to zotatifin were mostly mild, readily managed and reversible, and included fatigue, anemia, diarrhea, vomiting and nausea. In the 25 patients that had received the recommended Phase 2 dose, none exhibited zotatifin-related Grade 3, 4 or 5 TEAEs. In the ER+ breast cancer cohort evaluating zotatifin and fulvestrant (ECBF cohort), we reported one out of seven partial responses and three out of seven patients with stable disease, which allowed for expansion from seven total patients to 18 patients. In the ER+/FGFR amplified breast cancer cohort evaluating zotatifin as a monotherapy, one out of seven patients had stable disease, which was not sufficient to expand the size of the cohort. In the KRAS G12C NSCLC cohort evaluating zotatifin in combination with sotorasib, one patient had been enrolled at the interim data cutoff date and reported stable disease. In the ER+ breast cancer cohort evaluating zotatifin, fulvestrant and abemaciclib (ECBF+A cohort), two patients had been enrolled at the interim data cutoff date with one reported partial response.
 In January 2023, we reported updated interim data for the ECBF and ECBF+A cohorts. As of the December 15, 2022 cutoff date, zotatifin continued to be generally well tolerated with four Grade 3+ TEAE in the ECBF cohort (n=18) and four Grade 3+ TEAE in the ECBF+A cohort (n=7). One partial response and one patient with prolonged stable disease was reported in the ECBF cohort and two partial responses and one patient with prolonged stable disease was reported in the ECBF+A cohort. (See figure 20) Topline data for the remaining 11 patients in the ECBF+A cohort is anticipated to be available in the first half of 2023. In addition, based on the safety profile established and target engagement data generated to date, we announced that we resumed dose escalation. Data from the dose escalation portion of the trial is anticipated in the second half of 2023. We also announced that we would defer initiation of a previously planned cohort of Cyclin D1 amplified ER+ breast cancer patients and would pause enrollment in the KRAS G12C lung cancer cohort until completion of dose escalation.

*Preliminary results from ongoing trial prior to database lock. Data cutoff December 15, 2022.
 If zotatifin continues to demonstrate an adequate safety profile and sufficient signals of activity, we plan to continue clinical development of zotatifin, potentially as a combination in a randomized trial against a relevant comparator control group, or potentially in a single arm monotherapy trial following demonstration of an appropriate ORR in the Phase 2a expansion cohort.
 
Zotatifin as an antiviral agent for COVID-19
 
Zotatifin is designed to inhibit eIF4A-dependent translation of select mRNA into proteins. eIF4A is required to unwind the complex secondary structures within the 5’ UTR of coronaviruses, including COVID-19, and other RNA viruses, to translate viral RNA and replicate. Zotatifin was evaluated as one of 69 compounds for in vitro antiviral activity against SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by independent groups at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York and Institut Pasteur in Paris. Results from that study, published in Nature in April 2020, showed that zotatifin was one of the most active antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 among all the compounds tested. In subsequent studies using normal human bronchoepithelial cells, zotatifin demonstrated potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other coronaviruses including MERS-CoV. In addition, zotatifin was recently tested against numerous COVID isolates and other coronaviruses and was 10-100 times more potent than several agents authorized by the FDA for treatment of COVID, based on concentrations required to achieve comparable reductions in virus yield and protection from virus-induced cytopathic effects in cell-based assays. (see graphs in figure 21 below).

We have conducted a Phase 1b clinical trial of zotatifin as a potential host-directed anti-viral therapy in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, in collaboration with QBI at UCSF, which held a $5 million cooperative agreement sponsored by the Defensive Advanced Research Projects Agency. We have also used the funding to support the initiation of certain drug manufacturing activities and further development of a subcutaneous formulation for more convenient administration. We have recently completed a Phase 1b trial in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The trial is a double-blind, randomized dose escalation trial of zotatifin in non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 in 36 patients evaluating three different doses of zotatifin. In this trial, zotatifin was found to be safe and well-tolerated, and demonstrated favorable trends in several assessments of viral clearance compared to placebo (see graphs in figures 22 and 23 below). This trial began utilizing the same IV formulation currently being used in cancer trials but switched to a newly developed sub-cutaneous formulation for the last 34 patients enrolled. Phamacokinetics results show a profile of drug concentrations in blood over time virtually identical to the IV formulation, indicating the more convenient sub-cutaneous formulation could be used in future COVID or cancer trials. We have exhausted the full $5.0 million of allowable costs under our agreement with UCSF as of December 31, 2022.

eIF4E—Global Partnership with Pfizer
In December 2019, we entered into the Pfizer Agreement pursuant to which we granted Pfizer a global license to our earliest stage program, inhibitors of eIF4E. eIF4E is an oncogene and historically intractable target whose expression is increased, or upregulated, in a variety of human cancers and is linked to poor prognosis and resistance to certain therapies. eIF4E integrates signals from multiple important onco-genes and tumor suppressor proteins, including BRAF, MYC, mTOR, PI3K, AKT and PTEN, and selectively regulates the translation of a set of target mRNA largely distinct from those regulated by MNK and eIF4A. This may expand the potential patient population that may benefit from selective translation regulation therapy. In conjunction with Pfizer, we selected our lead development candidate to progress into IND-enabling studies that are ongoing. Pfizer is responsible for further development of this program, including submission of an IND and initiating a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial. See “—Pfizer Research Collaboration and License Agreement for Inhibitors of eIF4E” below for a description of the Pfizer Agreement.
Research conducted by Dr. Davide Ruggero and published in July 2015 in Cell, has demonstrated a small set of mRNA are sensitive to reduced levels of eIF4E. The eIF4E-sensitive mRNA encode proteins involved in oncogenic transformation, tumor growth stimulation, and inhibition of apoptotic pathways, suggesting eIF4E is an attractive target for cancer therapy. In addition, we believe tumors that overexpress eIF4E, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma and breast cancer, represent significant clinical opportunities.
 Because the natural ligand for eIF4E is a highly charged entity, termed the 5’ cap, it has been historically difficult to identify product candidates to inhibit this protein within cells. Using our proprietary structure-based and fragment-based drug design expertise we have invented several small molecule inhibitors of eIF4E that bind to the same site as, and compete with, the 5’ cap. In conjunction with Pfizer, we selected a lead product candidate which in preclinical models was shown to be a potent and selective inhibitor of eIF4E. This candidate has demonstrated activity in tumor cell assays and has demonstrated substantial in vivo anti-tumor activity.
 We are continuing to collaborate with Pfizer regarding the design and analysis of preclinical studies that Pfizer is conducting and supporting the development activities related to Pfizer’s fully funded activities of the worldwide development of our eIF4E inhibitors. We will continue to evaluate the development progress of the lead product candidate inhibitor of eIF4E, and consider building the sales and marketing infrastructure, as needed, to support the exercise of our option to co-promote and profit share in the United States as the data evolves.
 
Our Proprietary Translation Regulation Technology Platform
 
We discovered our product candidates using our proprietary selective translation regulation technology platform. Our platform includes our ribosomal profiling technology combined with state-of-the-art chemistry design strategies. Our ribosomal profiling technology enables comprehensive and quantitative measurement of the density

of ribosomes on expressed mRNA in the cell which predicts the rate of translation and, therefore, enables identification of targets that are upregulated in tumors and whose production is sensitive to selective inhibition by our product candidates. Information as to which mRNA’s translation can be inhibited by our product candidates is an important part of our process to select tumor types and patient populations for clinical studies. Ribosomes are the macromolecular machines responsible for synthesizing proteins based on instructions contained in mRNA. This profiling has allowed us to assess the efficiency of mRNA’s translation in cells or in tissues, distinguishes between transcriptional and translational regulation of gene expression, and identifies therapeutic targets, biomarkers and contexts of drug sensitivity or resistance. By measuring translational efficiency in various normal and diseased states we have been able to determine which proteins are subject to translational regulation and, importantly, which proteins are upregulated in various disease states. We incorporated and enhanced the original technology licensed from UCSF and industrialized it for use in our internal drug discovery and development efforts. The application of this technology has generated a proprietary understanding of genes that are translationally dysregulated in multiple tumor types and allowed us to identify specific points of therapeutic intervention.
 To develop our product candidates, we conducted a focused approach to medicinal chemistry incorporating both fragment-based and structure-based design techniques. We also applied our specialized expertise regarding atomic interactions that offer potential for potent, highly specific drug target interactions. Our approach in identifying selective and potent inhibitors of our drug targets was based, in part, on balancing physical chemical properties with high binding affinity. We combined these drug design capabilities with external synthetic chemistry efforts to enhance our ability to identify potent and selective lead product candidates in an efficient and effective manner.

Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates and their component raw materials for use in our preclinical development and clinical trials and in relation to any future commercialization of our product candidates. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for obtaining the raw materials necessary to manufacture our product candidates, and we believe that these raw materials are readily available from more than one source. Additional third-party manufacturers are and will be used to fill, label, package and distribute investigational drug products. This approach allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure while enabling us to focus our expertise on developing our products. Although we believe we have multiple potential sources for the manufacture of our product candidates and the related raw materials, we currently rely on single manufacturers, including Curia Global (formerly AMRI), Catalent, and Corden, for different aspects of tomivosertib and zotatifin.
Commercialization Plan
 
We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company in commercializing products. We intend to build our own commercialization organization and capabilities over time to market any approved products in North America. We believe that this commercial organization can be modest in size and targeted to a relatively small number of oncologists specializing in our target markets. Outside of North America, we may establish collaborations with pharmaceutical companies to leverage their commercialization capabilities to maximize the potential of our product candidates.
 As our product candidates progress through stages of development, our commercial plans may change. Clinical data, the size of the development programs, the size of our target markets, the size of a commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence our U.S., European and rest of the world commercialization strategies.
Our Collaboration and License Agreements
 
Pfizer Research Collaboration and License Agreement for Inhibitors of eIF4E
 In December 2019, we entered into the Pfizer Agreement, to research and develop small molecules that target eIF4E. Pursuant to the Pfizer Agreement, we granted Pfizer a worldwide, exclusive license, with a right to

sublicense, under certain of our patents, know-how, and materials to use, develop, manufacture, commercialize, and otherwise exploit compounds or products targeting eIF4E, for any and all indications. Pursuant to the Pfizer Agreement, Pfizer granted us an option to co-fund and co-promote a single such licensed product under a profit and loss share arrangement in the United States. The option can be exercised prior to a specified time before the first patient is expected to be enrolled in a clinical trial intended to support an NDA for marketing approval.
 Under the Pfizer Agreement, eFFECTOR was responsible for initial research in collaboration with Pfizer, and Pfizer is responsible for all further development of this asset, including submission of an IND and conducting all clinical development and commercialization activities. Pfizer is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for a licensed product, and commercialize a licensed product where Pfizer has received regulatory approval, in the United States and certain other countries. In the event we exercise our co-funding and co-promotion option, a joint steering committee will oversee the development plan and budget of the co-developed product, and we will have the responsibility to conduct a portion of product marketing presentations to healthcare providers.
 Pursuant to the Pfizer Agreement, we received an upfront, one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable payment of $15 million dollars from Pfizer. Pfizer was obligated to reimburse us for costs incurred for research performed, up to a specified cap in the low double-digit millions. Upon the achievement of specified early development and regulatory milestones, Pfizer will be obligated to pay us up to $80 million dollars in the aggregate. For other non-early stage development milestones Pfizer’s payment obligations to us depend upon whether we have exercised our co-funding and co-promotion option: 1) if we do not exercise our option, non-early stage development payments may total up to $165 million dollars in aggregate, and 2) if we do exercise our option, non-early stage development payments may total up to $70 million dollars in aggregate. Upon the achievement of specified sales milestones, Pfizer is also obligated to make tiered milestone payments of up to $235 million dollars in aggregate. On a product-by-product basis, Pfizer will also be required to pay us high single-digit percentage royalties on annual net sales of each licensed product. If we exercise our co-promotion and co-funding option, royalty payments will exclude sales in the United States and we will share with Pfizer profits from sale of the relevant licensed product in the United States.
Unless earlier terminated, the Pfizer Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of all Pfizer payment obligations. Except in the U.S. if we exercise our co-funding and co-promotion option, following expiration of the obligation to pay royalties for any licensed product in a given country and payment of all amounts due, Pfizer’s license to such licensed product in such country will become fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free. Pfizer may terminate the Pfizer Agreement for convenience upon written notice. Either party may terminate the Pfizer Agreement if an undisputed material breach by the other party is not cured within a defined period of time, or upon notice for insolvency-related events of the other party that are not discharged within a defined time period.
 
Exclusive License Agreement with UCSF
 
In May 2013, we entered into an agreement with UCSF which provides us an exclusive license to UCSF’s patent rights in certain inventions (“UCSF Translational Profiling Patent Rights”) relating to translational profiling laboratory techniques initially developed at UCSF, including certain patent rights we co-own with UCSF. Under the agreement we are permitted to research, develop, make and sell products that we discover and develop utilizing the UCSF Translational Profiling Patent Rights, which we refer to as licensed products, and use certain licensed processes utilizing the UCSF Translational Profiling Patent Rights and to sublicense such licensed products and processes. Our exclusivity is subject to certain retained research rights of UCSF and is subject to the rights of the U.S. government, if any, as set forth in 35 U.S.C. §§ 200-212. Pursuant to this law, the U.S. government may have acquired a nonexclusive, nontransferable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the U.S. government the inventions described in the UCSF Translational Profiling Patent Rights throughout the world. We have the first right to pursue patent infringement claims of potential commercial significance with respect to the licensed UCSF Translational Profiling Patent Rights, subject to certain conditions.
 Under the agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to meet certain specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones related to the licensed products within specified time periods. In consideration of the rights granted to us under the agreement, we made a one-time license issue fee cash payment to UCSF of $50,000. In July 2021, we entered into an amendment to the license agreement to confirm the impact of

the merger on the license agreement, pursuant to which, upon the closing of the merger, we paid UCSF a one-time cash payment of approximately $1.0 million. We are also required to make cash milestone payments to UCSF upon the completion of certain clinical and regulatory milestones for the licensed products.
 To date, we have made cash milestone payments to UCSF in an aggregate amount of $40,000. The aggregate remaining potential milestone payments are approximately $375,000. Additionally, we have agreed to pay UCSF a royalty of less than one percent on net sales of each of the first two licensed products sold by us or our affiliates, subject to a minimum annual royalty payment of $15,000 (creditable against the royalty payment otherwise due for the year in which the minimum payment was made) and other adjustments in certain circumstances. Our royalty obligations continue for each licensed product or service until the expiration of the last licensed patent covering the applicable licensed product or service which will be February 2034, absent any patent term adjustment or extensions.
 UCSF may terminate the agreement if we fail to perform or violate any material term of the agreement and fail to cure such nonperformance or violation within 60 days of notice from UCSF or in the event of our insolvency. We are currently in compliance with all material terms of the agreement.
 We may terminate the agreement upon 60 days’ written notice to UCSF and may terminate the UCSF Translational Profiling Patent Rights on a claim-by-claim, patent-by-patent and country-by-country basis by giving written notice to UCSF. Absent early termination, the agreement will continue until the expiration date of the longest-lived patent right included in the UCSF Translational Profiling Patent Rights. In May 2016, pursuant to the terms of the UCSF license agreement, we provided notice of our election to terminate our obligations to pay the patent prosecution costs with respect to patent application claiming methods of treating cancer by inhibiting PRPS-2, thereby relinquishing our rights in any future products that would infringe the relinquished claims were they ever to be issued. At the time we made this election, we were aware of no such products within eFFECTOR or UCSF.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We own the issued patents and patent applications relating to our lead product candidate tomivosertib. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States directed to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of immuno-oncology and targeted therapy with eIF4A inhibitors. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions when available. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability (1) to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; (2) to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; (3) to obtain and maintain licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; (4) to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including any patents that we may own in the future; and (5) to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
As of February 1, 2023, our licensed, owned and co-owned patent portfolio is directed to MNK inhibitors (including tomivosertib), eIF4A mRNA helicase inhibitors (including zotatifin) and various applications of our proprietary selective translation regulation platform, as well as certain of our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements or other product candidates. We also possess and/or in-license substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, including related manufacturing processes and technology.
 Specifically, our patent portfolio includes the following families:
 •MNK Inhibitors—We have twelve U.S. patents and thirty-one foreign patents (Australia (2), Belize, Canada, Chile, China (3), Columbia, Europe (2), Hong Kong, South Korea, India, Israel (2), Japan (4), Mexico (2), Peru, Philippines, Russia (3), Singapore, South Africa and Taiwan (2)), as well as seven pending U.S. patent applications and forty-six pending foreign patent applications (Australia (2), Belize, Brazil (3), Canada (5), Chile, China (2), Europe (4), Hong Kong (3), India (5), Israel, Japan (2), South 


Korea (3), Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand (4), Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore (3), Taiwan and South Africa), with claims directed to: composition of matter claims directed to our lead product candidate, tomivosertib and composition of matter claims to other MNK inhibitors; methods of treating MNK-related indications; the use of MNK inhibitors in combination with other translation inhibitors; processes for making tomivosertib the use of MNK inhibitors in immunotherapy; and the use of MNK inhibitor biomarkers for detecting MNK-related indications and for treating MNK-related indications. Any patents that issue from these pending patent applications will expire between June 2035 and June 2040, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. The existing U.S. and foreign patents will expire between June 2035 and May 2038, absent any patent term extensions. We own the patents and all the pending patent applications in this patent family.
 •eIF4A Inhibitors—We have five U.S. patents and thirteen foreign patents (Australia (2), China, Columbia, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan (2), Mexico, Russia, South Africa and Taiwan), as well as three pending U.S. patent applications, and 25 pending foreign patent applications (Australia (2), Belize, Brazil (2), Canada (3), Chile, China (2), Europe (3), Hong Kong (2), India, Japan, South Korea (3), Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, and Philippines) with claims directed to: composition of matter claims directed to our lead product candidate zotatifin and other eIF4A inhibitors, as well as methods for treating eIF4A-related diseases. Any patents that issue from these pending patent applications will expire between November 2036 and March 2041, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. The existing U.S. and foreign patents will expire between February 2035 and May 2038, absent any patent term extensions. We own all the pending patent applications in this patent family.
 •eIF4E Inhibitors—We have three U.S. patents, two foreign patents (Australia, Taiwan), two pending U.S. patent applications, one pending PCT application and thirteen pending foreign patent applications (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Europe (2), Indonesia, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Singapore) with claims directed to eIF4E inhibitors, as well as claims directed to methods for treating eIF4E-related diseases. Patents that have or will issue from these pending patent applications will expire between February 2035 and December 2041, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. The existing U.S. patents will expire between February 2035 and June 2040, absent any patent term extensions. While we own the patents and pending patent applications in this patent family, Pfizer has exclusively licensed most eIF4E patents and patent applications.
 •UCSF Translational Profiling Patent Rights—We have a patent in Europe and China licensed from UCSF with claims directed to the use of translational profiling in methods of treatment. The last to expire patent right that has issued or will issue from these licensed and co-owned pending patent applications will expire in February 2034, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 With respect to our product candidates and processes we intend to develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue patent protection covering, when possible, compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies.
 Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for applications filed in the United States can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued U.S. patent that covers or claims an FDA approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called patent term extension. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of immuno-oncology has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may

diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and enforce the patent rights that we license and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products.
Moreover, even the issued patents that we license do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology. The issued patents that we in-license and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents that we own or exclusively in-license. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.

Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and supply resources or experience than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. We also face competition from such companies in seeking any future potential collaborations to partner our product candidates. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic and other competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 
If any of our product candidates are approved in oncology indications such as NSCLC or breast cancer, they will compete with small molecule therapies, biologics, cell-based therapies and traditional chemotherapy, or a combination of any such methods. With respect to tomivosertib, we are aware of AUM Biosciences which is developing a MNK inhibitor, AUM001 in solid tumors. In addition, several novel combinations with FDA-approved PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors are being developed in NSCLC. These include, among others, anti-TIGIT and anti-LAG3 therapies from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Gilead Sciences, GSK plc, Merck & Co, Novartis AG and Roche. With respect to zotatifin, we are aware of PIC Therapeutics which is developing pre-clinical small molecules targeting the

eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs). Moreover, there are currently several marketed drugs and product candidates in development for the treatment of ER+ breast cancer that may compete with zotatifin, including fulvestrant marketed by AstraZeneca plc, elacestrant marketed by Menarini, AKT inhibitors being developed by AstraZeneca plc and Roche, oral SERDS being developed by Arvinas, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Eli Lilly and Co, Eisai Co., Ltd, Roche and Zentalis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., among others.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. We, along with any third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our products and product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Drug Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice requirements and other applicable regulations;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices ("GCPs") to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
 
The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate the molecule’s toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the

IND. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of effects on reproduction and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring subject safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 • Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
 •Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
 •Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of the product’s effectiveness for its intended use(s) 


and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or sponsors may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval, and may be used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 In addition, during the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
U.S. Review and Approval Process
 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once filed, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the filing date to complete a standard review of an NDA for a drug that is a new molecular entity. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and

facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
After the FDA evaluates an NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the application may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in

clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any marketing application for a drug submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a Fast Track designation and/or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. An NDA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available alternatives for such disease or condition. For new-molecular-entity NDAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date.
Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled confirmatory clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if, among other things, the sponsor fails to conduct the required confirmatory studies in a timely manner or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition with either (i) a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or (ii) a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same disease or condition for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. A designated orphan drug many not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.



Post-approval Requirements
 
Drug products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
 •clinical holds on clinical studies;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling.

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”) which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 
Marketing Exclusivity
 
Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2),("505(b)(2) NDA"), submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
 The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
Pharmaceutical companies like us are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such regulation may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, develop, and ultimately, sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Such laws include, without limitation, federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, and false claims laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal Civil False Claims Act, and transparency laws and regulations addressing drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made by pharmaceutical manufacturers to physicians and other healthcare providers, such as the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act. Violations of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of noncompliance, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and imprisonment.
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Sales of any approved pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial

insurance and managed healthcare organizations, as well as the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Third-party payors are increasingly reducing coverage and reimbursement for medical products, drugs and related pharmaceutical company services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product for which we may receive marketing approval in one or more jurisdictions. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales.
Moreover, as a condition of participating in, and having products covered under, certain U.S. federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, we may become subject to federal laws and regulations that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as Medicaid Average Manufacturer Price (“AMP”) and Best Price, Medicare Average Sales Price, the 340B Ceiling Price, and Non-Federal AMP reported to the Department of Veteran Affairs, and with respect to Medicaid, pay statutory rebates on utilization of manufacturers’ products by Medicaid beneficiaries.
 Compliance with such laws and regulations will require significant resources and may have a material adverse effect on our revenues.

Healthcare Reform
 
In addition, as previously mentioned, the primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other health care funding and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in the United States, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contained a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and changes to fraud and abuse laws. As another example, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020 incorporated extensive health care provisions and amendments to existing laws, including a requirement that all manufacturers of drugs products covered under Medicare Part B report the product’s average sales price to the federal government beginning on January 1, 2022, subject to enforcement via civil money penalties.
 Since its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s ruling, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, which would eliminate the statutory cap on rebate amounts owed by drug manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (“MDRP”) which is currently capped at 100% of the AMP for a covered outpatient drug.
 Moreover, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Most recently, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage

in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025).
 At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the states’ ability to regulate pharmaceutical benefit managers (“PBMs”) and other members of the health care and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that is expected to lead to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area.
 It also possible that governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could impact the amounts that federal and state governments and other third-party payors will pay for healthcare products and services.

Data Privacy & Security
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.

eFFECTOR THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1.Organization and Basis of Presentation 
Description of Business
Locust Walk Acquisition Corp. ("LWAC”) was initially formed on October 2, 2020 as a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses.
On May 26, 2021, LWAC entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Locust Walk Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of LWAC (“Merger Sub”), and eFFECTOR Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Old eFFECTOR”).
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, a business combination between LWAC and Old eFFECTOR was effected through the merger of the Merger Sub with and into Old eFFECTOR, with Old eFFECTOR becoming the surviving company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of LWAC with the name of eFFECTOR Therapeutics Operations, Inc. On August 25, 2021, and in connection with the closing of the business combination (the "Business Combination"), LWAC was renamed eFFECTOR Therapeutics, Inc. ("eFFECTOR" or the "Company"). All outstanding preferred shares of Old eFFECTOR converted into common shares of Old eFFECTOR on a 1:1 basis, which were then converted, along with all outstanding common shares of Old eFFECTOR, into common shares of the surviving eFFECTOR company through application of an exchange ratio of approximately 0.09657 (the "Exchange Ratio").
The Company is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on pioneering the discovery and development of a new class of oncology drugs the Company refers to as selective translation regulator inhibitors ("STRIs"). The Company’s principal operations are in the United States, with its headquarters in Solana Beach, California. The Company has devoted substantially all of its resources to raising capital, identifying potential product candidates, establishing its intellectual property portfolio, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, establishing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of its product candidates and related raw materials, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. The Company has not generated revenues from its principal operations, other than from licensing and grant revenue, through December 31, 2022.
Basis of Presentation
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, LWAC was treated as the “acquired” company and eFFECTOR is treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes.
Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Old eFFECTOR issuing stock for the net assets of LWAC, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of LWAC are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded.
Old eFFECTOR was determined to be the accounting acquirer based on the following predominant factors:
•Old eFFECTOR’s shareholders have a majority of the voting power of the combined company;
•the Board and Management are primarily composed of individuals associated with Old eFFECTOR; and
•Old eFFECTOR comprises all of the ongoing operations of the combined company.
The consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations prior to the Business Combination are those of Old eFFECTOR.
Liquidity
The Company has a limited operating history and the sales and income potential of the Company’s business and market are unproven. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Management is required to perform a two-step analysis over its ability to continue as a going concern. Management must first evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
F-
 
concern (step 1). If management concludes that substantial doubt is raised, management is also required to consider whether its plans alleviate that doubt (step 2).
The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since its inception, aside from the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 when net income was realized as a result of a gain in fair value recognized associated with the earn-out liability and non-recurring revenue in connection with the Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Pfizer, respectively. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $143.6 million at December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company used $25.9 million in cash for operations. At December 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $26.3 million. The Company anticipates that its expenses will increase significantly in connection with its ongoing activities to support its research and development efforts, and it expects to incur substantial operating losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. Management has prepared cash flow forecasts which indicate that based on the Company’s expected operating losses and negative cash flows, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within twelve months from the date that these financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 are issued. The principal payments due under the Oxford Loans (as defined below), and the related accrued final payment, have been classified as current liabilities as of December 31, 2022, due to the considerations discussed above and the assessment that the material adverse change clause under the Oxford Loans is not within the Company’s control. The Company has not been notified of an event of default by the lender as of the date of issuance of these financial statements.
The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to receive additional capital. Management intends to raise additional capital through equity offerings or other capital sources, including potential additional collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. Additionally, the Company may receive additional milestone payments from the Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Pfizer (described in Note 12), through the issuance of common stock under the equity purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (described in Note 9) or through the issuance of common stock under the at-the-market offering program (described in Note 9) with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. However, the Company may not be able to secure additional financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all, and may not receive any milestone payments. Without additional capital, the Company may be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some of its research and development activities, or other operations and potentially delay product development in an effort to provide sufficient funds to continue its operations, or may be required to pursue merger or acquisition strategies, all of which could adversely affect the holdings or the rights of its stockholders.
2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Use of Estimates
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements requires it to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimate in the Company’s consolidated financial statements relates to its clinical trial expense accruals. Management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. Although these estimates are based on the Company’s historical experience, knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately materially differ from these estimates and assumptions.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds with an original maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase.
Short-term Investments
Short-term investments consist of U.S. Treasury securities, classified as available-for-sale securities and have maturities of greater than three months but less than one year. The Company has classified all of its available-for-sale securities as current assets on the balance sheets because these are considered highly liquid securities and are available for use in current operations. The Company carries these securities at fair value, and reports unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Amortization and accretion of any purchase premiums or discounts is included in interest income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
F-
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of all cash equivalents, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms, the Company believes the fair value of the term loans approximate their carrying value (see Note 7).

Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company maintains deposits in a federally insured major financial institution in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and management believes that the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institution in which those deposits are held.
The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other biopharmaceutical companies, including, but not limited to, the need to obtain adequate additional funding, possible failure of current or future preclinical studies or clinical trials, reliance on third parties or partners to conduct its clinical trials, the need to obtain regulatory and marketing approvals for its drug candidates or to rely on partners to do so, competitors developing new technological innovations, the need to successfully commercialize and gain market acceptance of its drug candidates, the right to develop and commercialize drug candidates pursuant to the terms and conditions of the licenses granted to the Company, protection of proprietary technology, the ability to make milestone, royalty or other payments due under any license or collaboration agreements, and the need to secure and maintain adequate manufacturing arrangements with third parties. If the Company does not successfully commercialize or partner any of its drug candidates, it will be unable to generate product revenue or achieve profitability.

Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally three to five years, or the remaining term of the lease for leasehold improvements, whichever is shorter) and generally consist of laboratory equipment, computer and office equipment, furniture and fixtures, and leasehold improvements. Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred.

Long-Lived Assets
The Company regularly reviews the carrying value and estimated lives of all of its long-lived assets, including property and equipment to determine whether indicators of impairment may exist which warrant adjustments to carrying values or estimated useful lives. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess over the carrying amount of the asset’s fair value. The Company has not recognized any impairment losses from inception through December 31, 2022.

Leases
At the inception of a contractual arrangement, the Company determines whether the contract contains a lease by assessing whether there is an identified asset and whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset in exchange for consideration over a period of time. If both criteria are met, the Company records the associated lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset upon commencement of the lease using the implicit rate or a discount rate based on a credit-adjusted secured borrowing rate commensurate with the term of the lease. The Company additionally evaluates leases at their inception to determine if they are to be accounted for as an operating lease or a finance lease. A lease is accounted for as a finance lease if it meets one of the following five criteria: the lease has a purchase option that is reasonably certain of being exercised, the present value of the future cash flows is substantially all of the fair market value of the underlying asset, the lease term is for a significant portion of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, the title to the underlying asset transfers at the end of the lease term, or if the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative uses to the lessor at the end of the term. Leases that do not meet the finance lease criteria are accounted for as an operating lease. Operating lease assets represent a right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease liabilities with a term greater than one year and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recognized on the balance sheet at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received. As the Company’s leases do not typically provide an implicit rate, the Company utilizes the appropriate incremental borrowing rate, determined as the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term and in a similar economic environment. Lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease payments are recognized as operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Variable lease payments primarily include common area maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, and other operating costs that are passed on from the lessor in proportion to the
F-
 
space leased by the Company. The Company has elected the practical expedient to not separate between lease and non-lease components.

Grant Revenue
The Company’s grant revenues were derived from a grant with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (“DARPA”) through the University of California, San Francisco (“UCSF”). The Company recognizes DARPA grant revenue as reimbursable grant costs are incurred up to pre-approved award limits within the budget period. The costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Billings in excess of receipts are included as a receivable recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with the preclinical and clinical development of the Company’s product candidates. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Clinical Trial Accruals and Preclinical Studies
The Company records expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors and consultants, CROs and clinical sites in connection with conducting clinical trials and preclinical studies. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such contracts. The Company reflects clinical trial and preclinical study expenses in the financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which services and efforts are expended. The Company accounts for these expenses according to the progress of the clinical trial or preclinical study as measured by the timing of various aspects of the
clinical trial, preclinical study, or related activities. The Company determines accrual estimates based on the underlying contracts, correspondence with clinical and other key personnel and third-party service providers as to the progress of the clinical trials, preclinical studies, or other services being conducted, and amounts invoiced or paid to date. During the course of a clinical trial or preclinical study, the Company adjusts the rate of expense recognition if actual results differ from estimates.

Patent Costs
Costs related to filing and pursuing patent applications are recorded as general and administrative expense and expensed as incurred since recoverability of such expenditures is uncertain.

Revenue Recognition
The Company evaluates collaboration arrangements to determine whether units of account within the collaboration arrangement exhibit the characteristics of a vendor and customer relationship. For arrangements and units of account where a customer relationship exists, the Company applies the revenue recognition guidance. The Company recognizes revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligations. At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct and determines those that are performance obligations. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.
If a license to the Company’s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, the Company recognizes revenues from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other performance obligations, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition on a prospective basis.
For research and development services performed under a collaboration agreement in which the performance obligation is satisfied over time, the Company measures the progress of the activities using an input method. The input methods used are based on the effort expended or costs incurred toward the satisfaction of the related performance obligation. The Company estimates the amount of effort expended, including the time the Company estimates it will take to complete the activities, or costs incurred in a given period, relative to the estimated total effort or costs to satisfy the performance obligation. This results in a percentage that is multiplied by the consideration allocated to the research and development services to determine the amount of revenue recognized
F-
 
each period. This approach requires estimates and the use of significant judgement. If the estimates or judgements change over the course of the collaboration, they may affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized in the current and future periods.

Milestones
At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments (variable consideration), the Company evaluates whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the Company or the Company’s collaboration partner’s control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which the Company recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts the Company’s estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are allocated on a cumulative catch-up basis to satisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations, with the consideration allocated to an ongoing performance obligation being recognized over the period of performance.

Royalties
For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, the Company has not recognized any royalty revenue from any collaborative arrangement.

Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If management determines that the Company would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their recorded amount, management would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company maintained valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets as the Company concluded it had not met the “more likely than not” to be realized threshold. Changes in the valuation allowance when they are recognized in the provision for income taxes may result in a change in the estimated annual effective tax rate.
The Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) management determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, management recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense. Any accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability.

Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss consists of net loss and unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investments. The Company presents comprehensive loss and its components as part of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

Segment Reporting
Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. The Company and its chief operating decision-maker view the Company’s operations and manage its business in one operating segment.

F-
 
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
Stock-based compensation expense represents the cost of the grant date fair value of employee stock option grants recognized over the requisite service period of the awards (usually the vesting period) on a straight- line basis. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company accounts for stock options granted to non-employees using the fair value approach.
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including the risk- free interest rate, the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of stock options, and the expected dividend yield. The Company has limited historical stock option activity and therefore estimates the expected term of stock options granted using the simplified method, which represents the average of the contractual term of the stock option and its weighted-average vesting period. The fair value of the underlying common stock used within the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is based on the closing price of common stock on the date of grant.
Public and Private Placement Warrants
Upon completion of the Business Combination, the Company assumed public and private placement warrants that were issued by LWAC in connection with their initial public offering in January 2021 whereby holders of the public and private placement warrants are entitled to acquire common stock of the Company. The Company has concluded that the public warrants are equity-classified. Since the settlement value of the private placement warrants is dependent, in part, on who holds the warrants at the time of settlement, they are not considered indexed to the Company's stock and are therefore recorded as liabilities. Warrants classified as liabilities are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of issuance and are revalued at each subsequent balance sheet date, with fair value changes recognized in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The Company estimates the fair value of these warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Earn-out Shares
In accordance with the Merger Agreement, 5,000,000 shares ("Earn-Out Shares") are contingently issuable to Old eFFECTOR stockholders and option holders upon the occurrence of the Triggering Event (see Note 3), defined within the Merger Agreement as the date on which the common stock price equals or exceeds $20.00 over at least 20 trading days out of a 30 consecutive trading day period during the two-year period following the close date of the Business Combination. The estimated fair value of the Earn-Out Shares was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model using a distribution of potential outcomes on a monthly basis over the earn-out period using the most reliable information available.
The Company has determined that the contingent obligation to issue Earn-Out Shares to existing Old eFFECTOR shareholders is not indexed to the Company's stock under ASC 815-40 and therefore equity treatment is precluded. The Triggering Event that determines the issuance of the Earn-Out Shares includes terms that are not solely indexed to our common stock , and as such liability classification is required. Equity-linked instruments classified as liabilities are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of issuance and are revalued at each subsequent balance sheet date, with fair value changes recognized in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
The Company has determined that the contingent obligation to issue Earn-Out Shares to existing Old eFFECTOR option holders falls within the scope of ASC 718, Share-based Compensation, because the option holders are required to continue providing service until the occurrence of the Triggering Event. The fair value of the option holder Earn-Out Shares is recorded as share-based compensation over the derived service period of the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model, recognized in research and development and general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") or other standard setting bodies and adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes, based on their preliminary assessment, that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on their financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), which addresses the complexity associated with applying generally accepted accounting principles for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. The amendments in this ASU reduce the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock, as well as amend the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusion. In addition, this ASU improves and amends the related earnings per share guidance. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company on January 1, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption is either a modified retrospective method or a fully retrospective method of transition. The Company adopted this standard
F-
 
as of January 1, 2022 under the modified retrospective transition method, and it did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share
The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with the FASB guidance for Earnings Per Share, which established standards regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in earnings and dividends. The guidance requires earnings available to common shareholders for the period, after deduction of preferred stock preferences, to be allocated between the common and preferred shareholders based on their respective rights to receive dividends. The Company is not required to present basic and diluted net income per share for securities other than common stock; therefore, the net income (loss) per share amounts only pertain to the Company’s common stock.
Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing income (loss) allocable to common shareholders (net income after reduction for any required returns to preferred stock shareholders prior to paying dividends to the common shareholders, assuming current income for the period had been distributed) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, during the period. The Company calculates diluted net income per share using the more dilutive of the 1) treasury stock method, if-converted method, or contingently issuable share method, as applicable, or 2) the two-class method.
Due to the Company recording net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, and none of the outstanding securities being dilutive for this period, basic and diluted loss per share are the same for the year ended December 31, 2022.
The Company has used the treasury stock method to calculate diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2021, as there were no participating securities as of December 31, 2021 (and there were no participating securities in the period of net income during 2021). Diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2021 also reflects the assumed exercise of options outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method, to the extent dilutive. Warrants were included in the calculation of diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2021 to the extent the warrants were dilutive.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands, except share and per share data):

3.Business Combination
As discussed in Note 1, on August 25, 2021, the Company completed the Business Combination pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Upon closing of the Business Combination, the combined company was renamed eFFECTOR Therapeutics, Inc.
As a result of the Business Combination, each share of Old eFFECTOR preferred stock and common stock was converted into the right to receive approximately 0.09657 shares of the Company's common stock for an aggregate of 30,021,762 shares of common stock issued in the Business Combination. Former holders of shares of Old eFFECTOR common stock (including shares received as a result of the conversion of Old eFFECTOR preferred stock and the exercise of Old eFFECTOR warrants) and former holders of options to purchase shares of Old eFFECTOR will also be entitled to receive their pro rata share of up to 5,000,000 Earn-Out Shares of common stock if, on or prior to August 26, 2023, the closing share price of shares of common stock equals or exceeds $20.00 over at least 20 trading days within a 30-day trading period (the “Triggering Event”) and, in respect of each former holder of Old eFFECTOR stock options, such holder continues to provide services to the Company or one of its subsidiaries at the time of such Triggering Event. The Earn-Out Shares will also be earned and issuable in the event of a change in control of the Company on or prior to August 26, 2023 that results in the holders of common stock receiving a per-share price equal to or in excess of $20.00.
Pursuant to subscription agreements entered into in connection with the Merger Agreement (collectively, the “Subscription Agreements”), certain investors agreed to subscribe for an aggregate of 6,070,003 newly-issued shares of common stock at a purchase price of $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $60.7 million (the “PIPE Financing”). At the closing, we consummated the PIPE Financing. A total of 10,347,611 shares of common stock were issued in connection with the close of the Business Combination, inclusive of the PIPE Financing shares and shares held by LWAC sponsor and public investors.
In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the LWAC sponsor received 4,056,250 shares of eFFECTOR common stock, of which 300,000 shares were subject to vesting if, on or prior to August 25, 2024, the price of shares of common stock equals or exceeds $15.00 per share for a period of at least 20 trading days out of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date of determination (the "Sponsor Shares"). The 300,000 sponsor shares subject to vesting meet
the criteria for equity classification, but are not considered outstanding from an accounting perspective. These shares are considered issued but not outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and have been excluded from outstanding shares in the calculation of income (loss) per share for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
After giving effect to the Business Combination, and the consummation of the PIPE Financing, there were 40,669,373 shares of common stock issued and 40,369,373 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, options to purchase shares of Old eFFECTOR common stock were converted, at an exchange ratio of approximately 0.09657, into options to purchase an aggregate of 3,920,657 shares of common stock, with a weighted-average exercise price of $1.56 per share.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company’s shareholders exchanged their interests in the Company for shares of common stock of eFFECTOR. In addition, awards under the Company’s existing equity incentive plans, including the 2013 Plan, continue in full force and effect on the same terms and conditions as were previously applicable to such awards, subject to adjustments to the exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise based on the final exchange ratio of approximately 0.09657.
Gross proceeds from this transaction totaled approximately $67.0 million, which included funds held in LWAC’s trust and operating accounts and the completion of a concurrent sale of 6,070,003 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $10.00 per share in the PIPE Financing. The transaction was accounted for as a “reverse recapitalization” in accordance with GAAP. Under the reverse recapitalization model, the Business Combination was treated as eFFECTOR issuing equity for the net assets of LWAC, with no goodwill or intangible assets recorded. Under this method of accounting, LWAC was treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. This determination is primarily based on the fact that subsequent to the Business Combination, eFFECTOR stockholders have a majority of the voting power of the combined company, comprise all of the ongoing operations of the combined entity, comprise a majority of the governing body of the combined company, and eFFECTOR senior management comprise all of the senior management of the combined company.
In connection with the Business Combination, the Company raised $52.9 million of net proceeds. This amount was comprised of $6.3 million of cash held in LWAC’s trust and operating accounts from its initial public offering and $60.7 million of cash in connection with the PIPE Financing, less LWAC’s transaction costs and underwriters’ fees of $11.1 million. Old eFFECTOR incurred $3.0 million of transaction costs, consisting of banking, legal, and other professional fees which were recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. In addition to the net proceeds disclosed above, the Company also assumed $0.9 million of net liabilities of LWAC upon closing of the Business Combination.

4.Fair Value Measurements 

The accounting guidance defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the accounting guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e. supported by little or no market activity).
The Company’s cash equivalents are classified using Level 1 inputs within the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. None of the Company’s non-financial assets or liabilities are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. No transfers between levels have occurred during the periods presented.
The Company estimates the fair value of its warrant liabilities at the time of issuance and subsequent remeasurement using the Black-Scholes option pricing model at each reporting date, if required, based on the following inputs: the risk-free interest rates; the expected dividend rates; the remaining contractual life of the warrants; the fair value of the underlying stock; and the expected volatility of the price of the underlying stock. The estimates are based, in part, on subjective assumptions and could differ materially in the future. Changes to these assumptions as well as the fair value of the Company’s stock on the reporting date can have a significant impact on the fair value of the warrant liability.
The following table summarizes the Company’s assets and liabilities that require fair value measurements on a recurring basis and their respective input levels based on the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 (in thousands):

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
Financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of the Company’s cash equivalents and short-term investments. Cash equivalents consisted of money market funds and short-term investments consisted of U.S. Treasury securities. The Company obtains pricing information from its investment manager and generally determines the fair value of investment securities using standard observable inputs, including reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, and bids and/or offers.
Investments are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy if their quoted prices are available in active markets for identical securities. Investments in money market funds of $8.7 million and $49.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, were classified as Level 1 instruments and were included in cash and cash equivalents.
Investments in marketable securities are valued using Level 2 inputs. Level 2 securities are initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued and reported upon utilizing inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly, such as quotes from third-party pricing vendors. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs, which utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves, require the exercise of judgment and use of estimates, that if changed, could significantly affect the Company’s financial position and results of operations. The marketable securities of $17.6 million as of December 31, 2022 were classified as Level 2 instruments, all of which are included in short-term investments. There were no marketable securities as of December 31, 2021. Accrued interest receivable related to short-term investments was $27,000 as of December 31, 2022, and included as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets in the condensed balance sheets.
The following tables summarize the Company’s short-term investments accounted for as available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2022 (in thousands):

 | | $ | 17,620 | | $ | 1 | | $ | (19 | ) | $ | 17,602

Preferred Stock Warrant Liability
The preferred stock warrant liability was measured at fair value, using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs. The change in fair value of preferred stock warrant liabilities were recorded in Other income (expense) on the statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). All outstanding preferred stock warrants were cashless exercised as a result of the Business Combination on August 25, 2021 (See Note 8). The preferred stock warrants were remeasured to fair value on the date of cashless exercise based on the net shares issued and fair value of common stock on the settlement date, which was the close date of the Business Combination on August 25, 2021.

Private Placement Warrant Liability

In connection with the Business Combination, the Company assumed the public and private placement warrants described in Note 2. The private placement warrants are precluded from equity treatment and are recorded as liabilities as they are not considered indexed to the Company's common stock. The private placement warrant liability is measured at fair value, using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs. The change in fair value of the private placement warrant liability is recorded in other income (expense) on the statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The following key assumptions were used in determining the fair value of the private placement warrant liability valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021: 

 | December 31,2022 | | December 31,2021 |

7.Term Loans 

Oxford Term Loans
In March 2021, Old eFFECTOR entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (“Oxford LSA”) with Oxford Finance LLC (“Oxford”), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to $30.0 million, issuable in two separate tranches of $20.0 million (“Term A Loans”) and $10.0 million (“Term B Loans”), collectively referred to as the Oxford Loans. The Term A Loans became available to the Company at the effective date of the Oxford LSA on March 19, 2021 and $12.5 million of the proceeds were used to pay off the outstanding SVB Term Loans. The remaining net proceeds from Term A Loans of $7.4 million, after taking into effect specified issuance and legal fees designated within the distribution letter, were distributed to the Company in March 2021. The Company is required to make a final payment equal to 5.5% of each funded tranche at maturity, which has been recorded as a debt discount for the Term A Loans and is being amortized over the term of the debt arrangements. In connection with the Oxford LSA, the Company issued warrants to purchase a total of 37,575 shares of Series C Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $5.33 per share. The warrants were automatically exercised on a cashless basis on August 25, 2021, in connection with the completion of the Business Combination, for 17,575 shares of common stock.
On February 22, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the Oxford LSA whereby the interest only period for the Term A Loans will end on March 1, 2024, instead of May 1, 2023. In connection with the amendment, the maturity of the Term A Loans was extended from March 18, 2026 to February 1, 2027. Additionally, Term B Loans would have become available to the Company after January 1, 2023 upon achievement of certain clinical development milestones, until the earlier of (i) June 30, 2023, (ii) 45 days after the achievement of certain clinical development milestones (the "Phase II Milestones"), and (iii) the occurrence of an event of default. As a result of the discontinuation of one of the cohorts in the KICKSTART trial, which was previously announced in January 2023, the Company does not expect to achieve the clinical development milestones by June 30, 2023 and therefore does not expect to have access to the additional $10.0 million under the Term B Loans.
The Oxford Loans carry a variable interest rate equal to the greater of (i) 7.7% and (ii) the sum of the prime rate plus 4.45%. The Company has the option to prepay all, but not less than all, of the borrowed amounts, provided that the Company will be obligated to pay a prepayment fee equal to (i) 3.0% of the outstanding principal balance of the applicable Oxford Loans if prepayment is made prior to the first anniversary of the effective date of the Oxford LSA, (ii) 2.0% of the outstanding principal balance of the applicable Oxford Loans if prepayment is made after the first anniversary of the effective date of the Oxford LSA but before the second anniversary, and (iii) 1.0% of the outstanding principal balance of the applicable Oxford Loans if prepayment is made after the second anniversary of the effective date of the Oxford LSA but before the third anniversary. No prepayment fee will apply for a prepayment made after the third anniversary of the effective date of the Oxford LSA and prior to the maturity date. 
The Company’s obligations under the Oxford LSA are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of its current and future assets, other than its owned intellectual property. The Company is also obligated to comply with various other customary covenants, including restrictions on its ability to encumber intellectual property assets without consent.
The Company recorded a debt discount of $1.6 million for the estimated fair value of warrants, debt issuance costs, and final payment to be made, which is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective-interest method. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $20.0 million of outstanding principal under the Term A Loans of which $19.1 million is reflected on the balance sheet net of debt discounts. Interest expense, including amortization of debt discount related to the Oxford Term A Loans, totaled $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company is in compliance with all covenants under
F-18
 
the Oxford LSA as of December 31, 2022. The Term A Loans include customary events of default, including instances of a material adverse change in our operations, that may require prepayment of the outstanding Term A Loans. The principal payments due under the Oxford Loans, and the related accrued final payment, have been classified as current liabilities as of December 31, 2022, due to the considerations discussed in Liquidity section of Note 1. The Company has not been notified of an event of default by the lender as of the date of issuance of these financial statements.
Based on the outstanding principal amounts for the Company’s Term A Loans, the following table sets forth by year the Company’s required future principal payments as of December 31, 2022 (in thousands):


As of December 31, 2022 | | 
2024 | $ | 5,555 | 
2025 | | 6,667 | 
2026 | | 6,667 | 
2027 | | 1,111 | 
Required future principal payments | $ | 20,000 | 
Unamortized debt discount | | (939 | )
Current term loans, net as of December 31, 2022 | $ | 19,061 | 

SVB Term Loans
On August 31, 2018, Old eFFECTOR entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (“LSA”) with Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”), pursuant to which the Company borrowed $15 million.
In March 2021, Old eFFECTOR repaid the SVB loan using the proceeds from Oxford Term A Loans (defined above). The outstanding principal balance of the SVB loan was $11.5 million at the date of repayment. The Company paid the entire outstanding principal balance, along with a final payment in the amount of $0.8 million (equal to 5.5% of the original aggregate principal amount), a prepayment fee of $0.1 million (equal to 1% of the original aggregate principal amount), and $37,000 of accrued interest. The Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment in the amount of $0.5 million in connection with the transaction, which has been recorded in Loss on debt extinguishment on the consolidated statement of operations and other comprehensive income (loss) for the period. The loss on debt extinguishment includes the unamortized debt discount and final payment associated with the SVB loan at the time of extinguishment along with the $0.1 million prepayment fee.
8.Warrants 
Preferred Stock Warrants
The Company accounted for its warrants to purchase shares of convertible preferred stock as a liability. The Company adjusted the liability for changes in fair value of these warrants up until the closing date of the Business Combination. Upon consummation of the Business Combination on August 25, 2021, the outstanding warrants were cashless exercised and 50,529 total net shares were issued.
Assumed Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants
Following the consummation of the Business Combination, holders of the public warrants and private placement warrants are entitled to acquire common stock of the Company. The warrants became exercisable on January 12, 2022, which is 12 months from the closing of the LWAC's initial public offering. Each warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The public warrants and private placement warrants will expire on August 25, 2026, which is five years after the completion of the Business Combination.
Once the public warrants and private placement warrants became exercisable, the Company has the right to redeem the outstanding warrants in whole and not in part at a price of $0.01 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption, if and only if the last sale price of the common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.
The private placement warrants are identical to the public warrants except that, so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees: (i) they will not be redeemable by the Company; (ii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis; and (iii) they are subject to registration rights.
F-19
 
Private placement warrants are liability-classified (See Note 4) and the public warrants are equity-classified. The following table summarizes the number of outstanding public warrants and private placement warrants and the corresponding exercise price as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021:


 | December 31,2022 | | December 31,2021 | | Exercise Price | | Expiration Date
Public warrants | | 5,833,323 | | 5,833,333 | | $ | 11.50 | August 24, 2026
Private placement warrants | | 181,667 | | 181,667 | | $ | 11.50 | August 24, 2026


During the year ended December 31, 2022, warrants to purchase ten shares of common stock were exercised for gross proceeds of less than $1 thousand. No warrants were exercised in the year ended December 31, 2021.

 9.Preferred Stock and Stockholders’ Equity
Equity Purchase Agreement
On January 24, 2022, the Company entered into an equity purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) and a registration rights agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“Lincoln Park” or “Investor”) which provides for the sale to Lincoln Park up to $50.0 million of shares (the “Purchase Shares”) of the Company's common stock over the thirty-six (36) month term of the Purchase Agreement. In connection with the Purchase Agreement, Lincoln Park made an initial purchase of $3.0 million of shares of common stock (the "Initial Purchase"), which equated to 557,610 shares of common stock, and the Company issued 142,939 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park as a commitment fee in connection with entering into the Purchase Agreement. The Company recognized $0.8 million of other expense relating to the commitment fee share issuance. For the year ended December 31, 2022, an additional 30,000 shares of common stock were sold at an average price per share of $1.74 for gross proceeds of $52 thousand.
Under the Purchase Agreement, the Company has sole discretion, subject to certain conditions, on any business day selected by the Company to require Lincoln Park to purchase up to 30,000 shares of common stock (the “Regular Purchase Amount”) at the Purchase Price (as defined below) per purchase notice (each such purchase, a “Regular Purchase”). The Regular Purchase Amount may be increased as follows: to up to 50,000 shares if the closing price is not below $5.00, and up to 75,000 shares if the closing price is not below $10.00. Lincoln Park’s committed obligation under each Regular Purchase is capped at $2,500,000, unless the Parties agree otherwise. The purchase price for Regular Purchases (the “Purchase Price”) shall be equal to the lesser of: (i) the lowest sale price of the common shares during the Purchase Date, or (ii) the average of the three (3) lowest closing sale prices of the common shares during the ten (10) business days prior to the Purchase Date.
In addition to Regular Purchases and subject to certain conditions and limitations, the Company in its sole discretion may require Lincoln Park on each Purchase Date to purchase on the following business day up to the lesser of (i) three (3) times the number of shares purchased pursuant to such Regular Purchase or (ii) 25% of the trading volume on the Accelerated Purchase Date (the “Accelerated Purchase”) (unless the Parties agree otherwise) at a purchase price equal to the lesser of 97% of (i) the closing sale price on the Accelerated Purchase Date, or (ii) the Accelerated Purchase Date’s volume weighted average price (the “Accelerated Purchase Price”). The Company has the sole right to set a minimum price threshold for each Accelerated Purchase in the notice provided with respect to such Accelerated Purchase and under certain circumstances and in accordance with the Purchase Agreement the Company may direct multiple Accelerated Purchases in a day.
The aggregate number of shares that the Company can sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement may not exceed 8,133,926 shares of the Common Shares (which is equal to approximately 19.99% of the shares of the Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the Purchase Agreement) (the “Exchange Cap”), unless (i) shareholder approval is obtained to issue Purchase Shares above the Exchange Cap, in which the Exchange Cap will no longer apply, or (ii) the average price of all applicable sales of Common Shares to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement equals or exceeds $6.42 per share; provided that at no time may Lincoln Park (together with its affiliates) beneficially own more than 4.99% of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Shares.
The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, closing conditions, indemnification and termination provisions. The Purchase Agreement may be terminated by the Company at any time, at its sole discretion, without any cost or penalty, by giving one business day notice to Lincoln Park. Further, Lincoln Park has covenanted not to engage in any direct or indirect short selling or hedging of the Common Shares. There are no limitations on the use of proceeds, financial or business covenants, restrictions on future financings (other than restrictions on the Company’s ability to enter into a similar type of agreement or Equity Line of Credit during the Term, excluding an At-The-Market transaction with a registered broker-dealer), rights of first refusal, participation rights, penalties or liquidated damages in the Purchase Agreement.
F-20
 
At-the-Market Offering Program
In September 2022, the Company entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the "Sales Agreement") with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co (the "Agent", or "Cantor"), under which the Company may, from time to time, sell shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $15.0 million in “at the market” offerings (the "ATM Offering Program") through Cantor. Sales of the shares of common stock will be made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with Cantor. Cantor will receive a commission from the Company of 3.0% of the gross proceeds of any shares of common stock sold under the Sales Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold an aggregate of 478,964 shares of common stock at a weighted-average price of $0.60 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $0.3 million under the ATM Offering Program. Offering costs, including commissions, of approximately $0.2 million were recorded as an offset to gross proceeds within additional paid-in capital.
Preferred Stock
Upon closing of the Business Combination transaction, pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share were authorized. eFFECTOR's board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders to issue such shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the dividend, voting, and other rights, preferences and privileges of the shares. There were no issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock immediately after the closing of the Business Combination.
In connection with the closing of the Business Combination on August 25, 2021, all Old eFFECTOR convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock of eFFECTOR at an Exchange Ratio of 0.09657. 28,453,228 total shares of Old eFFECTOR convertible preferred stock (as adjusted for the Exchange Ratio), composed of 11,563,819 shares of Old eFFECTOR Series A convertible preferred stock, 10,154,819 shares of Old eFFECTOR Series B convertible preferred stock, and 6,734,590 shares of Old eFFECTOR Series C convertible preferred stock, were converted into 28,453,228 shares of eFFECTOR common stock.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The ESPP provides for six-month offering periods, and at the end of each offering period, employees are able to purchase shares at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the first trading day of the offering period or on the last trading day of the offering period. An aggregate of 880,000 shares were initially reserved and available for issuance under the ESPP. The ESPP provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance under the plan will automatically increase each January 1, beginning on January 1, 2022, by 1.0% of the outstanding number of shares of common stock on the immediately preceding December 31, or such lesser amount as determined by our board of directors; provided that the total number of shares of common stock that become available for issuance under the ESPP will never exceed 15,000,000. If our capital structure changes because of a stock dividend, stock split or similar event, the number of shares that can be issued under the ESPP will be appropriately adjusted. As of December 31, 2022, 1,200,842 shares were reserved for future issuance under the ESPP. During the year ended December 31, 2022, 86,057 shares of common stock were issued under the ESPP.
2013 Equity Incentive Plan
Prior to the Business Combination, Old eFFECTOR maintained its 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”), under which Old eFFECTOR granted incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. Upon the closing, the Company ceased granting awards under the 2013 Plan and, as described below, all awards under the 2013 Plan were converted into awards under the 2021 Plan with the same terms and conditions. As of August 25, 2021, prior to the Business Combination transaction, 3,920,657 Old eFFECTOR options remained outstanding under the 2013 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, the number of shares reserved under the 2013 Plan was 3,629,846. There were zero shares available for grant under the 2013 Plan as of December 31, 2022. In connection with the completion of the Business Combination and the adoption of the 2021 Plan, no further awards will be granted under the 2013 Plan.
2021 Equity Incentive Plan
In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination on August 25, 2021, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). As of December 31, 2022, 8,794,485 shares of common stock are authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2021 Plan, inclusive of any shares of common stock subject to stock options, restricted stock awards or other awards that were assumed in the Business Combination. As of December 31, 2022, 5,598,409 options to purchase common shares have been awarded and 3,685,451 shares remain available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based award or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants.
F-21
 
Options granted under the 2021 Plan are exercisable at various dates as determined upon grant and will expire no more than ten years from their date of grant, or in the case of certain non-statutory options, ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price of each option shall be determined by the Board of Directors based on the Fair Market Value of the Company’s stock on the date of the option grant, defined as the closing sales price of the Company's common stock. In the case of incentive stock options, the exercise price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Company’s common stock at the time the option is granted. For holders of more than 10% of the Company’s total combined voting power of all classes of stock, incentive stock options may not be granted at less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of the Company’s stock at the date of grant and for a term not to exceed five years. 
A summary of the Company’s stock option activity under the plans is as follows (in thousands, except share and per share amounts and years):


 | Shares | | | Weighted-Average Exercise Price | | | Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term | Aggregate Intrinsic Value
Outstanding at December 31, 2021 | | 4,193,321 | | | $ | 2.41 | | 6.0 | $ | 26,115
Granted | | 5,253,923 | | | | 3.17 | | 9.4 | | 
Exercised | | (4,828 | ) | | | 0.52 | | 0.4 | | 
Cancelled or forfeited | | (703,536 | ) | | | 4.14 | | 8.6 | | 
Outstanding at December 31, 2022 | | 8,738,880 | | | $ | 2.73 | | 7.4 | $ | — 
Vested and exercisable at December 31, 2022 | | 4,354,101 | | | $ | 2.40 | | 5.4 | $ | — 


For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total fair value of vested options was $4.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was zero and $0.7 million, respectively.
The weighted-average grant date fair value of employee option grants during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $2.21 per share and $4.75 per share, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of non-employee option grants during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $2.30 per share and $8.71 per share, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense specifically related to stock options of $5.0 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock option grants were as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2022 | 2021 
Risk-free interest rate | 1.7% - 4.1% | 0.7% - 1.3%
Expected volatility | 82% - 86% | 81% - 90% 
Expected term (in years) | 5.2 - 6.1 | 5.5 - 6.1 
Expected dividend yield | 0% | 0% 


Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free rate assumption is based on the U.S. Treasury instruments, the terms of which were consistent with the expected term of the Company’s stock options.
Expected volatility. Due to the Company’s limited operating history and lack of company-specific historical or implied volatility, the expected volatility assumption was determined by examining the historical volatilities of a group of industry peers whose share prices are publicly available.
Expected term. The expected term of stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to be outstanding. The Company uses the simplified method for estimating the expected term as provided by the SEC. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the weighted average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options.
Expected dividend yield. The expected dividend assumption is based on the Company’s history and expectation of dividend payouts. The Company has not paid and does not intend to pay dividends.
Forfeitures. The Company reduces stock-based compensation expense for actual forfeitures during the period in which they occur.
As of December 31, 2022, the unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding employee options was $7.3 million and is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately 2.4 years. Unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding
F-22
 
nonemployee options was $1.5 million as of December 31, 2022, and is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately 1.0 years.
Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance
Common stock reserved for future issuance consists of the following as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021:


 | December 31,2022 | | December 31,2021
Stock options issued and outstanding | | 8,738,880 | | 4,193,321 
Public warrants issued and outstanding | | 5,833,323 | | 5,833,333 
Private placement warrants issued and outstanding | | 181,667 | | 181,667 
Earn-Out shares | | 5,000,000 | | 5,000,000 
Unvested sponsor shares | | 300,000 | | 300,000 
Authorized for future stock awards or option grants | | 3,685,451 | | 6,201,340 
Authorized for future issuances under the ESPP | | 1,200,842 | | 880,000 
Total | | 24,940,163 | | 22,589,661

 
10. Earn-Out Shares
In accordance with the Merger Agreement, 5,000,000 Earn-Out Shares are contingently issuable to Old eFFECTOR stockholders and option holders upon the occurrence of the Triggering Event, defined within the Merger Agreement as the date on which the common stock price equals or exceeds $20.00 over at least 20 trading days out of 30 consecutive trading day period for the two-year period following the close date of the Business Combination. As of December 31, 2022, the stockholders and option holders would be eligible to receive approximately 4,561,353 and 438,647 Earn-Out Shares, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the stockholders and option holders would be eligible to receive approximately 4,426,889 and 573,111 Earn-Out Shares, respectively.
The fair value per share of the Earn-Out Shares was $0.0014 and $2.74, respectively as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The fair value was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model using a distribution of potential outcomes on a monthly basis over the Earn-Out Period using the most reliable information available. Assumptions used in the valuation were as follows:


 | December 31,2022 | | December 31,2021 | 
Stock price | $ | 0.43 | | $ | 8.28 | 
Expected volatility | | 115.0 | % | | 65.0 | %
Risk-free interest rate | | 4.8 | % | | 0.6 | %
Forecast period (in years) | | 0.6 | | | 1.6 | 
Cost of equity | | 20.0 | % | | 20.0 | %

Old eFFECTOR Shareholders
The Company has determined that the contingent obligation to issue Earn-Out Shares to existing Old eFFECTOR shareholders is not indexed to the Company's stock under ASC 815-40 and therefore equity treatment is precluded. The Triggering Event that determines the issuance of the Earn-Out Shares includes terms that are not solely indexed to the common stock of the Company, and as such liability classification is required. As of the consummation date of the Business Combination, the estimated fair value of the shareholder Earn-Out Shares was approximately $61.0 million and the Company will revalue the liability each reporting period with the changes in fair value being recorded to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was a decrease in the earn-out liability of $12.1 million and $48.9 million, respectively, which was recorded as a gain on change in fair value within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). In accordance with the Merger Agreement, Earn-Out Shares attributable to Old eFFECTOR option holders who discontinue providing service before the occurrence of the Triggering Event are reallocated to the remaining eligible stockholders and option holders.

Old eFFECTOR Option Holders
The contingent obligation to issue Earn-Out Shares to existing Old eFFECTOR option holders falls within the scope of ASC 718, Share-based Compensation, because the option holders are required to continue providing service until the occurrence of the Triggering Event. The fair value of the option holder Earn-Out Shares at the consummation date of the Business Combination was approximately $7.9 million, which was recorded as share-based compensation over the derived service period of 0.36 years following the consummation of the Business Combination. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was approximately $0.3 million and $7.6 million recorded in share-based compensation related to the Earn-Out Shares, respectively, and the derived service period was completed as of March 31, 2022, with no additional share-based compensation expense to be recorded.

 11.License Agreements 
In May 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with the Regents of the University of California (“UCSF”) which provides the Company with an exclusive license to UCSF’s patent rights in certain inventions (the “UCSF Translational Profiling Patent Rights”) relating to translational profiling laboratory techniques initially developed at UCSF. Under the agreement, the Company is permitted to research, develop, make and sell products that it discovers and develops utilizing the UCSF Translational Profiling Patent Rights, which the Company refers to as licensed products, and use certain licensed processes utilizing the UCSF Translational Profiling Patent Rights and to sublicense such licensed products and processes.
In July 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the license agreement to confirm the impact of the Business Combination on the license agreement, including clarifying that in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company would pay UCSF a one-time cash payment of approximately $1.0 million. The $1.0 million payment was made to UCSF in August 2021 in connection with the close of the Business Combination. The Company is also required to make cash milestone payments to UCSF upon the completion of certain clinical and regulatory milestones for the licensed products. The aggregate remaining potential milestone payments are approximately $375,000.
The Company paid an annual minimum royalty of $15,000 to UCSF for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. All license related fees were recorded as research and development expense.

 12.Research Collaboration and License Agreement 
In December 2019, the Company entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Pfizer Agreement”) with Pfizer to research and develop small molecules that target eIF4E.
Under the Pfizer Agreement, the Company was responsible for initial research in collaboration with Pfizer, and Pfizer is responsible for all further development of the program, including submission of an IND and conducting all clinical development and commercialization activities. Pfizer is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for a licensed product, and commercialize a licensed product where Pfizer has received regulatory approval, in the United States and certain other countries. In the event the Company exercises its co-funding and co-promotion option, a joint steering committee will oversee the development plan and budget of the co-developed product, and the Company will have the responsibility to conduct a portion of product marketing presentations to healthcare providers.
Pursuant to the Pfizer Agreement, the Company received an upfront, one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable payment of $15 million from Pfizer. Pfizer was obligated to reimburse the Company for costs incurred for research performed, up to a specified cap in the low double-digit millions. Upon the achievement of specified early development and regulatory milestones, Pfizer will be obligated to pay the Company up to $80 million in the aggregate. For other non-early stage development milestones Pfizer’s payment obligations to the Company depends upon whether the Company has exercised its co-funding and co-promotion option: 1) if it does not exercise the option, non-early stage development payments may total up to $165 million in aggregate, and 2) if it does exercise the option, non-early stage development payments may total up to $70 million in aggregate. Upon the achievement of specified sales milestones, Pfizer is also obligated to make tiered milestone payments of up to $235 million in aggregate. On a product-by-product basis, Pfizer will also be required to pay the Company high single-digit percentage royalties on annual net sales of each licensed
F-24
 
product. If the Company exercises its co-promotion and co-funding option, royalty payments will exclude sales in the United States and the Company will share with Pfizer profits from sale of the relevant licensed product in the United States.
The initial transaction price of $27.0 million was allocated to the two performance obligations on a relative standalone value basis, with $25.6 million allocated to the license and $1.4 million allocated to the research activities, which were completed in 2020. The value attributable to the license was recognized upon delivery of the license to Pfizer and the value attributable to the research activities was recognized pro-rata based on the actual costs incurred by the Company compared to the total estimated costs of the research activities from the time of execution to the end of the research program.
There was no revenue recorded in connection with this agreement for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 because all development and sales milestones (variable consideration) were fully constrained. 
13.DARPA Grant Revenue 
In April 2021, the Company entered into a Research Subaward Agreement with UCSF (the "Subaward Agreement"), whereby up to $5.0 million in allowable costs were reimbursable for clinical and manufacturing activities related to zotatifin for the treatment of COVID-19. Under the terms of the Subaward Agreement, the Company was obligated to provide financial and technical reports to UCSF on a periodic basis. The Subaward Agreement can be terminated by either party upon written notice and also in the event that DARPA suspends or terminates its cooperative agreement with UCSF. The initial award period for the Subaward Agreement ended in December 2021, and in April 2022 the Company received an extension of the award period to December 2022, with the same maximum $5.0 million reimbursement amount. The Company recognized $3.6 million and $1.4 million of revenue under the Subaward Agreement in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company exhausted the full $5.0 million of allowable reimbursable costs under the Subaward Agreement.

14. Commitments and Contingencies
Leases
In November 2020, the Company entered into a non-cancelable operating sublease for office space in San Diego, California, with a lease term through December 2021. Rent expense under this lease was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
In September 2021, the Company entered a non-cancelable three-year lease for certain new office space in Solana Beach, California, with an option to renew for an additional three-year term. The initial term of the lease started on November 1, 2021, and is serving as the Company's new headquarters. Rent expense under this lease was $0.1 million and $16,400 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
During each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company paid $0.1 million in lease payments. All lease payments were included in operating activities in the statements of cash flows.

Management assesses all available evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. The Company has experienced net losses since inception (aside from the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 when net income was realized as a result of a gain in fair value recognized associated with the earn-out liability and non-recurring revenue in connection with the Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Pfizer, respectively), and the revenue and income potential of the Company’s business and market are unproven. Due to the Company’s continuing research and development activities, the Company expects to continue to incur net losses into the foreseeable future. As such, the Company cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance of $56.7 million and $48.9 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, has been established to offset the deferred tax assets, as realization of such assets is uncertain.
Utilization of net operating loss (“NOL”) and research and development (“R&D”) credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that may have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), as well as similar state and foreign provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of NOL and R&D credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an “ownership change” as defined by Section 382 of the Code results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders. Since the Company’s formation, the Company has raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions, which on its own or combined with the purchasing stockholders’ subsequent disposition of those shares, may have resulted in such an ownership change, or could result in an ownership change in the future.
The Company completed a preliminary Code section 382 and 383 study from inception through December 31, 2020 and concluded that $1.8 million of federal and California net operating losses and $0.1 million of federal R&D credits will expire unused. The Company removed deferred tax assets for net operating loss of $0.6 million and research credits of $0.1 million from its deferred tax assets schedule and has recorded a corresponding decrease in the valuation allowance. The Company has not conducted the 382 study after December 31, 2020. When the study is completed, the Company will adjust its deferred tax assets accordingly. Due to the existence of a full valuation allowance any subsequent ownership changes will not impact the Company’s effective tax rate.
The Company had federal and California NOL carryforwards of approximately $181.6 million and $92.8 million, respectively, portions of which begin to expire in 2034 and 2036, respectively. Federal NOLs of $103.1 million carry forward indefinitely.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal and California research and development (“R&D” tax) credit carryforwards of approximately $9.6 million, inclusive of the federal orphan drug tax credit carryforward, and $4.3 million, respectively. The federal R&D tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2034, unless previously utilized. The California R&D tax credit carryforwards are available indefinitely. As of December 31, 2022, the Company also had federal orphan drug tax credit carryforwards of $2.2 million that will begin to expire in 2037.
The Inflation Reduction Act 2022 which incorporates a Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) was signed on August 16, 2022. The changes will affect for the tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The new tax will require companies to compute two separate calculations for federal income tax purposes and pay the greater of the new minimum tax or their regular tax liability. The Company will be monitoring the impacts of the act to determine if this will have an impact for the Company for years beginning after December 31, 2022. The act is not expected to have a material impact for the Company.
The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition at the effective date to be recognized.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for 2022 and 2021, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in thousands):


 | December 31,2022 | | December 31,2021 | 
Balance at beginning of the year | $ | 8,235 | | $ | 7,623
Additions/(reductions) for tax positions - prior year | | — | | | — 
Increase related to current year positions | | 625 | | | 612 
Balance at the end of the year | $ | 8,860 | | $ | 8,235


For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized interest and penalties of approximately $62,000 and $50,000, respectively, which are recorded in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest and penalties are captured within the interest expense and other income (expense) lines, respectively, on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company did not recognize any interest or penalties.
F-
 
The Company currently files income tax returns in California and with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The Company currently has no tax periods under examination by any jurisdiction. Due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards, all tax periods from inception of the Company are open for examination by taxing authorities for all jurisdictions.
Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022 is $7.4 million that, if recognized, would not impact the Company’s income tax expense (benefit) or effective tax rate as long as our deferred tax asset remains subject to a full valuation allowance. The Company does not expect any significant increases or decreases to our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.
