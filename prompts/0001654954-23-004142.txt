General Overview

                Vaso Corporation principally operates in three distinct business segments in the healthcare equipment and information technology industries.  We manage and evaluate our operations, and report our financial results, through these three business segments.

· | IT segment, operating through a wholly-owned subsidiary VasoTechnology, Inc., primarily focuses on healthcare IT and managed network technology services; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VasoTechnology

VasoTechnology, Inc. was formed in May 2015, at the time the Company acquired all of the assets of NetWolves, LLC and its affiliates, including the membership interests in NetWolves Network Services, LLC  (collectively, “NetWolves”).  It currently consists of a managed network and security service division (NetWolves) and a healthcare IT application VAR (value added reseller) division (VasoHealthcare IT).

VasoHealthcare

VasoHealthcare commenced operations in 2010, in conjunction with the Company’s execution of its exclusive sales representation agreement with GEHC, which at the time was the healthcare business division of the General Electric Company (“GE”), to further the sale of certain medical capital equipment in certain domestic market segments.  Its current offering consists of:


· | GEHC diagnostic imaging equipment and ultrasound systems. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------
· | GEHC service agreements for the above equipment. 
· | GEHC training services for use of the above equipment. 
· | GEHC and third-party financial services for the above equipment.


VasoHealthcare has built a team of over 75 highly experienced sales professionals who utilize proprietary sales management and analytic tools to manage the complete sales process and to increase market penetration.

VasoMedical

The proprietary medical equipment business under VasoMedical dates back to 1995 when the Company began the proprietary Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP®) technology in the United States, and has since diversified to include other medical hardware and software.  Vasomedical Global was formed in 2011 to combine and coordinate the various international operations including design, development, manufacturing, and sales of medical devices and software, while domestic activities are conducted under Vasomedical Solutions.  These devices and software primarily consist of cardiovascular diagnostic and therapeutic applications, including:


· | Biox™ series Holter monitors and ambulatory blood pressure recorders. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | ARCS® series analysis, reporting and communication software for ECG and blood pressure signals, including cloud-based software suite and algorithm subscription services.
· | MobiCare® multi-parameter wireless vital-sign monitoring system. 
· | EECP® therapy systems for non-invasive, outpatient treatment of ischemic heart disease. 


This segment uses its extensive in-house knowledge for cardiovascular devices and software coupled with its engineering resources to cost effectively create and market its proprietary technology. It sells and services its products to customers in the U.S. and China directly and sells and/or services its products in the international market mainly through independent distributors.

Historical Background

Vaso Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in July 1987. For most of its history, the Company primarily was a single-product company designing, manufacturing, marketing and servicing its proprietary Enhanced External Counterpulsation, or EECP®, therapy systems, mainly for the treatment of angina. In 2010 it began to diversify its business operations. The Company changed its name to Vaso Corporation in 2016 to more accurately reflect the diversified nature of its business, and continues to use the original name VasoMedical for its proprietary medical device subsidiary.

In May 2010, the Company launched its Professional Sales Service business through a wholly-owned subsidiary Vaso Diagnostics, Inc. d/b/a VasoHealthcare, which was appointed by GEHC as its exclusive representative for the sale of select GEHC diagnostic imaging equipment to specific market segments in the 48 contiguous states of the United States and the District of Columbia.  The original agreement (“GEHC Agreement”) was for three years ending June 30, 2013; it has been extended several times with the current extension through December 31, 2026, subject to earlier termination under certain conditions.

In June 2014, the Company began its IT segment business by concluding the Value Added Reseller Agreement (“VAR Agreement”) with GEHC to become a national value added reseller of GEHC Digital’s software solutions such as Picture Archiving and Communication System (“PACS”), Radiology Information System (“RIS”), and related services, including implementation, training, management and support.  This business focuses primarily on customer segments currently served by VasoHealthcare.  A new wholly owned subsidiary, VasoHealthcare IT Corp. (“VHC IT”), was formed to conduct the healthcare IT business.

In May 2015, the Company further expanded its IT business segment by acquiring all of the assets of NetWolves, LLC and its affiliates, including the membership interests in NetWolves Network Services, LLC (collectively, “NetWolves”), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. NetWolves designs and delivers efficient and cost-effective multi-network and multi-technology solutions as a managed network provider, as well as provides a complete single-source solution that includes design, network redundancy, application device management, real-time network monitoring, reporting and support systems as a comprehensive solution.  

The Company’s Equipment business also has been significantly expanded from the original EECP®-only operations.  In September 2011, the Company acquired FGE, a British Virgin Islands company, which owned or controlled two Chinese operating companies - Life Enhancement Technology Ltd. (“LET”) and Biox Instruments Co. Ltd. (“Biox”) - to expand its technical and manufacturing capabilities and to enhance its distribution network, technology, and product portfolio.  Biox was a variable interest entity (“VIE”) controlled by FGE through certain contracts and an option to acquire all the shares of Biox by FGE’s wholly owned subsidiary Gentone, and in March 2019 Gentone exercised its option to acquire all of the shares of Biox. In August 2014, the Company through Gentone acquired all of the outstanding shares of Genwell Instruments Co. Ltd. (“Genwell”), which was formed in 2010 to develop the MobiCare® wireless multi-parameter patient monitoring system and holds intellectual property rights for this system. As a result, the Company has expanded its equipment products portfolio to include Biox™ series ambulatory patient monitoring systems, ARCS® series software for ECG and blood pressure analysis, and the MobiCare® patient monitoring device.        

In April 2014, the Company entered into a cooperation agreement with Chongqing PSK-Health Sci-Tech Development Co., Ltd. (“PSK”) of Chongqing, China, the leading manufacturer of external counter pulsation, or ECP, therapy systems in China, to form a joint venture company, VSK Medical Limited (“VSK”), a Cayman Islands company, for the global marketing, sale and advancement of ECP therapy technology.  The Company owned 49.9% of VSK, which commenced operations in January 2015.  In March 2018, the Company terminated the cooperation agreement with PSK and sold its shares in VSK to PSK.  On May 20, 2020, the Company closed on the sale of 51% of the capital stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary EECP Global Corporation (“EECP Global”) to PSK. EECP Global was formed in September 2019 to hold all the assets and liabilities of its EECP business. Concurrently with the closing of the transaction, the Company signed Management Service Agreement with EECP Global to provide management service for the business and operation of EECP Global in the United States. The agreement provides an initial term of three years starting April 1, 2020, the effective date of the sale, which is automatically renewable for additional one-year terms. Pursuant to the agreement, EECP Global reimburses the Company all direct expenses and pays a monthly management fee during the term of the agreement.

Management

The Company currently bases its headquarters in Plainview, Long Island, NY pursuant to a lease which expires in September 2025.  Reporting to the Board of Directors, corporate officers of the Company include the President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Co-Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, Chief Operating Officer (“COO”), and Co-Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.

The management of the Company’s IT segment is led by the COO of the Company, who is also the President of VasoTechnology and NetWolves, which is based in Tampa, FL.  Our VasoHealthcare IT business is organized as a part of VasoTechnology and is also led by the COO, supported by several software solution sales and implementation specialists, based in Nashville, TN. The business unit works with our VasoHealthcare diagnostic imaging equipment sales team to generate leads and potential clients for the software solutions products and works with NetWolves sales and technical teams for comprehensive IT product and service offerings.

In the professional sales services segment, we sell GEHC diagnostic imaging products to our assigned market through a nationwide team of approximately 65 sales employees led by several regional managers and an executive team who report to the President of VasoHealthcare. The operation is also supported by in-house administrative, analytic and other support staff, as well as applicable GEHC employees.

The equipment segment is under the direct supervision of the CEO of the Company. Sales and marketing efforts in the domestic market are led by a Vice President of national sales and service at Vasomedical Solutions, and the managers of our China subsidiaries, based in Wuxi, China, are in charge of the development and production of all our proprietary products and marketing and sales in China and the international markets.  We sell our Biox™ series and other products in China by a group of sales managers as well as through distributors covering various regions of China and other international geographies.

Competition

In the U.S. diagnostic imaging market where we sell GEHC products, our main competitors include Siemens, Philips, Canon, and Hologic. Key competitive factors in the market include price, quality, finance availability, delivery speed, service and support, innovation, distribution network, breadth of product and service offerings and brand name recognition. GEHC is a leading competitor in this market.

In the IT segment, our primary competitors in the healthcare IT VAR business are Agfa Healthcare, McKesson, Philips, Carestream Health and other independent software providers. Key competitive factors are brand recognition, quality, radiology workflow solutions, scalability and service and support capability.  In the managed network services business our primary competition includes, but is not limited to, organizations who have a presence in most of the major markets for the following products and services: network services, managed services, security services and healthcare applications. Several of those competitors, many of which are our vendors, are: Verizon, AT&T, CenturyLink, IBM and Cisco Resellers, Siemens, Epic, small regional IT integrators and large company internal IT departments.   

In the ambulatory monitoring system business, there are numerous competitors of various size and strength.  The Biox™ series is among the few from China with CE Mark certification for Europe, CFDA approval for China, US FDA clearances as well as Brazilian Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria (ANVISA) approval, which are among the most important qualifications to market and sell the products around the world.

Regulations on Medical Devices

As a medical device manufacturer and marketer, we are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government regulatory agencies, including the US FDA and similar foreign agencies.  We are required to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards governing the development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, quality testing, labeling, promotion, import, export, and distribution of our medical devices.  

Compliance with Regulations in the United States

The Company has received appropriate US FDA premarket notification (510(k)) clearance for all its products marketed and sold in the United States, including EECP® therapy systems and Biox™ ambulatory monitoring systems and analysis and report software.  We continue to seek US FDA clearance or approval for new products prior to their introduction to the US market.

We are subject to other US FDA regulations that apply prior to and after a product is commercially released.  We also are subject to periodic and random inspections by the US FDA for compliance with the current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and Quality System Regulation.  The US FDA also enforces post-marketing controls that include the requirement to submit medical device reports to the agency when a manufacturer becomes aware of information suggesting that any adverse events are related to its marketed products.  The FDA relies on medical device reports to identify product problems and utilizes these reports to determine, among other things, whether it should exercise its enforcement powers.  The FDA also may require post-market surveillance studies for specified devices.

We are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act’s, or FDCA’s, general controls, including establishment registration, device listing, and labeling requirements.  

The sales and advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC.  The FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.  Violations of the FTC Act, such as failure to have substantiation for product claims, would subject us to a variety of enforcement actions, including compulsory process, cease and desist orders and injunctions, which can require, among other things, limits on advertising, corrective advertising, consumer redress and restitution, as well as substantial fines or other penalties.

As a medical device sales channel partner and product reseller to healthcare facilities, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. 

Foreign Regulation 

In most countries where we seek to export our medical devices, a local regulatory clearance must be obtained.  The regulatory review process varies from country to country and can be complex, costly, uncertain, and time-consuming.  Our medical devices are all manufactured in accordance with ISO 13485 (Medical device – Quality management systems – Requirement for regulatory purpose), an internationally agreed standard that sets out the requirements for a quality management system specific to the medical devices industry.  All our current medical devices have obtained necessary clearances or approvals prior to their release in the appropriate jurisdictions, including CE marking certification for European Union countries, China FDA (CFDA) approval for mainland China, Korean FDA (KFDA) approval for South Korea, Agência Nacional de Vigilncia Sanitária (ANVISA) approval for Brazil, Taiwan FDA (TFDA) for Taiwan,  and the Saudi SFDA (MDMA) for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

We are also subject to audits by organizations authorized by foreign countries to determine compliance with laws, regulations and standards that apply to the commercialization of our products in those markets.  Examples include auditing by a European Union Notified Body organization (authorized by a member state’s Competent Authority) to determine conformity with the Medical Device Directives (MDD) and by an organization authorized by the Brazilian government to determine conformity with the ANVISA requirement. 

Patient Privacy 

Federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restrict the use and disclosure of that protected information.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published patient privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA privacy rule) and the regulation was finalized in October 2002.  Currently, the HIPAA privacy rule affects us only indirectly in that patient data that we access, collect and analyze may include protected health information.  Additionally, we have signed some Business Associate Agreements with Covered Entities that contractually bind us to protect private health information, consistent with the HIPAA privacy rules requirements.  We do not expect the costs and impact of the HIPAA privacy rule to be material to our business.

Regulations in the IT Business

As a reseller of telecommunication services and network solutions provider, our products and services are subject to federal, state and local regulations. These regulations govern, in part, our rates and the way we conduct our business, including the requirement to offer telecommunications services pursuant to nondiscriminatory rates, terms, and conditions, the obligation to safeguard the confidentiality of customer proprietary network information, as well as the obligation to maintain specialized records and file reports with the Federal Communications Commission  and state regulatory authorities. While we believe we are in compliance with laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we do business, we continue to monitor and assess our compliance.

The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) exercises jurisdiction over services and regulates interstate and international communications in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S territories. As an independent U.S. government agency overseen by Congress, the FCC is the United States' primary authority for communications laws, regulation and technological innovation.

We maintain Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity in all 50 states, which enable us to provide services within each state. We are therefore subject to regulation from the Public Utility Commissions in each state.

Intellectual Properties

In addition to other methods of protecting our proprietary technology, know-how and show-how as well as trade secrets, we pursue a policy of seeking patent protection, both in the US and abroad, for our proprietary technologies including those in Biox™ and MobiCare® products. Moreover, trademarks have been registered for the names “Vaso”, “Vasomedical”, “VasoGlobal”, “VasoSolutions”, “VasoHealthcare”, “ARCS”, and “MobiCare”.

Through our China-based subsidiaries, we own thirty-seven invention and utility patents in China that expire at various times through 2041, as well as sixteen software copyright certificates in China related to proprietary technologies in physiological data acquisition, analysis and reporting.  We also maintain five registered trademarks in China for our products.

Through our NetWolves subsidiary we hold a patent for Secure and Remote Monitoring Management (“SRM”) and we hold trademarks “NetWolves”, “SRM”, and “Wolfpac”.

There can be no assurance that our patents will not be violated or that any issued patents will provide protection that has commercial significance.  As with any patented technology, litigation could be necessary to protect our patent position.  Such litigation can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful. 

Employees

As of December 31, 2022, we employed 272 full-time persons, of which 14 are employed through our facility in Plainview, New York; 85 through VasoHealthcare; 5 through VasoHealthcare IT; 111 through our NetWolves operations; and 57 in our China operations.  None of our employees are represented by a labor union.  We believe that our employee relations are good.

The Company also uses several part-time employees and consultants from time to time for various purposes.

Manufacturing

The Company conducts manufacturing activities primarily through its Biox facilities in China, while maintaining certain manufacturing capability in the Plainview, NY location to satisfy certain domestic and international needs for the EECP® systems.  The Biox facilities manufacture ambulatory monitoring devices and other medical devices.

All manufacturing operations are conducted under the cGMP requirements, as set forth in the FDA Quality System Regulation, as well as ISO 13485 (Medical device – Quality management systems – Requirement for regulatory purpose), an internationally agreed standard that sets out the requirements for a quality management system specific to the medical devices industry.  We are also certified to conform to full quality assurance system requirements of the EU Medical Device Directive (MDD 93/42/EEC Annex II) and can apply CE marking to all of our current product models.  Lastly, we are certified to comply with the requirements of the Brazilian Agência Nacional de Vigilncia Sanitária (ANVISA).  All these regulations and standards subject us to inspections to verify compliance and require us to maintain documentation and controls for the manufacturing and quality activities.

We believe our manufacturing capacity and warehouse facility are adequate to meet the current and immediately foreseeable future demand for the production of our medical devices.  We believe our suppliers of the other medical devices we distribute or represent are capable of meeting our demand for the foreseeable future.
