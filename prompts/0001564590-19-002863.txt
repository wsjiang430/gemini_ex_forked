 Overview 
 We are a Houston, Texas-based oilfield services company that primarily owns and operates in the United States one of the largest fleets of land-based drilling rigs and a large fleet of pressure pumping equipment.  We were formed in 1978 and reincorporated in 1993 as a Delaware corporation.  
 Our contract drilling business operates in the continental United States and western Canada, and we are pursuing contract drilling opportunities outside of North America.  As of December 31, 2018, we had a drilling fleet that consisted of 252 marketed land-based drilling rigs.  A drilling rig includes the structure, power source and machinery necessary to cause a drill bit to penetrate the earth to a depth desired by the customer.  We also have a substantial inventory of drill pipe and drilling rig components that support our drilling operations.  
 We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas and the Mid-Continent and Appalachian regions.  Substantially all of the revenue in the pressure pumping segment is from well stimulation services (such as hydraulic fracturing) for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.  Well stimulation involves processes inside a well designed to enhance the flow of oil, natural gas, or other desired substances from the well.  We also provide cementing services through the pressure pumping segment.  Cementing is the process of inserting material between the wall of the well bore and the casing to support and stabilize the casing.  As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1.6 million fracturing horsepower to provide these services.  Our pressure pumping operations are supported by a fleet of other equipment, including blenders, tractors, manifold trailers and numerous trailers for transportation of materials to and from the worksite as well as bins for storage of materials at the worksite.  
 We also provide a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services in most major producing onshore oil and gas basins in the United States. Our directional drilling services include directional drilling, downhole performance motors, motor rentals, directional surveying, measurement-while-drilling, wireline steering tools and services that improve the accuracy of horizontal wellbore placement.
 We have other operations through which we provide oilfield rental tools in select markets in the United States. We also manufacture and sell pipe handling components and related technology to drilling contractors, and provide electrical controls and automation to the energy, marine and mining industries, in North America and other select markets.  In addition, we own and invest, as a non-operating working interest owner, in oil and natural gas assets that are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico.
Recent Developments
 On October 25, 2018, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Current Power Solutions, Inc. (“Current Power”).  Current Power is a provider of electrical controls and automation to the energy, marine and mining industries.
 On March 27, 2018, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, which is a committed senior unsecured revolving credit facility that permits aggregate borrowings of up to $600 million, including a letter of credit facility that, at any time outstanding, is limited to $150 million and a swing line facility that, at any time outstanding, is limited to $20 million.
 On February 20, 2018, we acquired the business of Superior QC, LLC (“Superior QC”), including its assets and intellectual property.  Superior QC is a provider of software and services used to improve the statistical accuracy of horizontal wellbore placement.  Superior QC’s measurement-while-drilling (MWD) Survey FDIR (fault detection, isolation and recovery) service is a data analytics technology to analyze MWD survey data in real-time and more accurately identify the position of a well. 
 On January 19, 2018, we completed an offering of $525 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.95% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”).  The net proceeds before offering expenses were approximately $521 million, of which we used $239 million to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.

On October 11, 2017, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of MS Directional, LLC (f/k/a Multi-Shot, LLC) (“MS Directional”).  MS Directional is a leading directional drilling services company in the United States, with operations in most major producing onshore oil and gas basins.  MS Directional provides a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services, including directional drilling, downhole performance motors, motor rentals, directional surveying, measurement-while-drilling, and wireline steering tools. 
 On April 20, 2017, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “merger agreement”) with Seventy Seven Energy Inc. (“SSE”), a subsidiary of ours was merged with and into SSE (the “SSE merger”), with SSE continuing as the surviving entity and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries.  On April 20, 2017, following the SSE merger, SSE was merged with and into our newly-formed subsidiary named Seventy Seven Energy LLC (“SSE LLC”), with SSE LLC continuing as the surviving entity and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Through the SSE merger, we acquired a fleet of 91 drilling rigs, 36 of which we consider to be APEX® rigs. Additionally, through the SSE merger, we acquired approximately 500,000 horsepower of fracturing equipment located in Oklahoma and Texas.  The oilfield rentals business acquired through the SSE merger has a fleet of premium oilfield rental tools and provides specialized services for land-based oil and natural gas drilling, completion and workover activities.  
 Operational data in the discussion and analysis in this Report includes the results of operations of Current Power since October 25, 2018, the results of operations of Superior QC since February 20, 2018, the results of operations of the MS Directional business since October 11, 2017 and the results of operations of the SSE businesses since April 20, 2017.
 Quarterly average oil prices and our quarterly average number of rigs operating in the United States for 2016, 2017 and 2018 are as follows:

 The closing price of oil was as high as $107.95 per barrel in June 2014.  Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016.  Oil prices have recovered from the lows experienced in the first quarter of 2016.  Oil prices reached a high of $77.41 in June 2018.  Oil prices remain volatile, as the closing price of oil reached a fourth quarter 2018 high of $76.40 per barrel on October 3, 2018, before declining by 42% over the course of three months to reach a low of $44.48 per barrel in late December 2018. Oil prices averaged $59.08 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2018.  
 Our rig count declined significantly during the industry downturn that began in late 2014 but has improved since the second quarter of 2016.  Our average rig count for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 183 rigs, which included 182 rigs in the United States and one rig in Canada.  This was an increase from our average rig count for the third quarter of 2018 of 178 rigs, which included 177 rigs in the United States and one rig in Canada.  Our rig count in the United States at December 31, 2018 of 183 rigs was greater than the rig count of 163 rigs at December 31, 2017.  Term contracts have supported our operating rig count during the last three years.  Based on contracts currently in place, we expect an average of 122 rigs operating under term contracts during the first quarter of 2019 and an average of 78 rigs operating under term contracts throughout 2019.
 With the weakness in crude oil prices late in the fourth quarter, operators have been delaying starting new completion projects in the first quarter, and pricing remains extremely competitive.  As such, we have made the decision to idle spreads rather than work at unreasonably low prices.  We ended the fourth quarter with 20 active spreads and idled three spreads early in the first quarter of 2019.  
 Industry Segments 
 Our revenues, operating income (loss) and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to three industry segments: 
  
• | contract drilling services,
--+----------------------------


• | pressure pumping services, and
--+-------------------------------

 4


 
• | directional drilling services.
--+-------------------------------

 Our contract drilling services industry segment had operating losses in 2018, 2017 and 2016.  Our pressure pumping services industry segment had operating losses in 2018 and 2016 and operating income in 2017.  Our third industry segment, directional drilling services, was a new segment for us as a result of the MS Directional acquisition in 2017 and accounted for approximately six percent and two percent of our 2018 and 2017 consolidated revenues, respectively.  Our directional drilling segment had operating losses in 2018 and 2017.
 See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Items 7 and 8, respectively, of this Report for financial information pertaining to these industry segments.  
 Contract Drilling Operations 
 General — We market our contract drilling services to major, independent and other oil and natural gas operators.  As of December 31, 2018, we had 252 marketed land-based drilling rigs based in the following regions: 

• | 74 in west Texas and southeastern New Mexico,
--+----------------------------------------------


• | 24 in north central and east Texas and northern Louisiana,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | 37 in the Rocky Mountain region (Colorado, Wyoming and North Dakota),
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 31 in south Texas,
--+-------------------


• | 38 in western Oklahoma,
--+------------------------


• | 42 in the Appalachian region (Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia), and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 6 in western Canada.
--+---------------------

 Our marketed drilling rigs have rated maximum depth capabilities ranging from approximately 13,200 feet to 25,000 feet.  All of these drilling rigs are electric rigs.  An electric rig converts the power from its diesel engines into electricity to power the rig.  We also have a substantial inventory of drill pipe and drilling rig components, which may be used in the activation of additional drilling rigs, or as upgrades or replacement parts for marketed rigs.  
 Drilling rigs are typically equipped with engines, drawworks, top drives, masts, pumps to circulate the drilling fluid, blowout preventers, drill pipe and other related equipment.  Over time, components on a drilling rig are replaced or rebuilt.  We spend significant funds each year as part of a program to modify, upgrade and maintain our drilling rigs.  We have spent approximately $822 million during the last three years on capital expenditures to (1) build new land drilling rigs and (2) modify, upgrade and extend the lives of components of our drilling fleet.  During fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, we spent approximately $395 million, $354 million and $72.5 million, respectively, on these capital expenditures. 
 Depth and complexity of the well, drill site conditions and the number of wells to be drilled on a pad are the principal factors in determining the specifications of the rig selected for a particular job.  
 Our contract drilling operations depend on the availability of drill pipe, drill bits, replacement parts and other related rig equipment, fuel and other materials and qualified personnel.  Some of these have been in short supply from time to time.  
 Drilling Contracts — Most of our drilling contracts are with established customers on a competitive bid or negotiated basis.  Our bid for each job depends upon location, equipment to be used, estimated risks involved, estimated duration of the job, availability of drilling rigs and other factors particular to each proposed contract.  Our drilling contracts are either on a well-to-well basis or a term basis.  Well-to-well contracts are generally short-term in nature and cover the drilling of a single well or a series of wells.  Term contracts are entered into for a specified period of time (frequently six months to four years) or for a specified  number of wells.  During 2018, our average number of days to drill a well (which includes moving to the drill site, rigging up and rigging down) was approximately 21 days.  
 Our drilling contracts obligate us to provide and operate a drilling rig and to pay certain operating expenses, including wages of our drilling personnel and necessary maintenance expenses.  Most drilling contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice and may or may not contain provisions for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.  
 5


Our drilling contracts provide for payment on a daywork basis, pursuant to which we provide the drilling rig and crew to the customer.  The customer provides the program for the drilling of the well.  Our compensation is based on a contracted rate per day during the period the drilling rig is utilized.  We often receive a lower rate when the drilling rig is moving or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond our control.  Daywork contracts typically provide separately for mobilization of the drilling rig.  
 Contract Drilling Activity — Information regarding our contract drilling activity for the last three years follows:

 Drilling Rigs and Related Equipment — We have made significant upgrades during the last several years to our drilling fleet to match the needs of our customers.  While conventional wells remain a source of oil and natural gas, our customers have expanded the development of shale and other unconventional wells to help supply the long-term demand for oil and natural gas in North America.  
 To address our customers’ needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays, we have expanded our areas of operation and improved the capability of our drilling fleet.  We have delivered new APEX® rigs to the market and have made performance and safety improvements to existing high capacity rigs.  APEX® rigs are electric rigs with advanced electronic drilling systems, 500-ton top drives, iron roughnecks, hydraulic catwalks, and other automated pipe handling equipment.  APEX® rigs that are pad-capable are designed to efficiently drill multiple wells from a single pad, by “walking” between the wellbores without requiring time to lower the mast and lay down the drill pipe.  As of December 31, 2018, our marketed land-based drilling fleet was comprised of the following: 

 | Number of Rigs | | | 
--------------------+----------------+-------+--------+------
Classification | United States | | Canada | | Total | Percent Pad-Capable
APEX® 1500 HP rigs | | 169 | | — | | 169 | 94 | %
APEX® 1000 HP rigs | | 14 | | — | | 14 | 100 | %
APEX® 1200 HP rigs | | 4 | | — | | 4 | 100 | %
APEX® 1400 HP rigs | | 5 | | — | | 5 | 100 | %
APEX® 2000 HP rigs | | 6 | | — | | 6 | 67 | %
Other electric rigs | | 48 | | 6 | | 54 | 59 | %
Total | | 246 | | 6 | | 252 | 87 | %
Average horsepower | | 1,465 | | 1,117 | | 1,457 | | 

 
The U.S. land rig industry refers to certain high specification rigs as “super-spec” rigs.  We consider a super-spec rig to be at least a 1,500 horsepower, AC powered rig that has a 750,000-pound hookload, a 7,500-psi circulating system, and is pad-capable.  We currently estimate there are approximately 650 super-spec rigs in the United States, which includes 149 of our APEX® rigs.
 We perform repair and/or overhaul work to our drilling rig equipment at our yard facilities located in Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Ohio and western Canada. 
 Pressure Pumping Operations 
 General — We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators, primarily in Texas (West and South Regions), the Mid-Continent region (Mid-Con Region) and the Appalachian region (Northeast Region).  Pressure pumping services consist primarily of well stimulation services (such as hydraulic fracturing) for the completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.  Wells drilled in shale formations and other unconventional plays require well stimulation through hydraulic fracturing to allow the flow of oil and natural gas.  This is accomplished by pumping fluids and proppant under pressure into the well bore to fracture the formation.  Many wells in conventional plays also receive well stimulation services. We also provide cementing services through the pressure pumping segment. The cementing process inserts material between the wall of the well bore and the casing to support and stabilize the casing.  
 6


Pressure Pumping Contracts – Our pressure pumping operations are conducted pursuant to a work order for a specific job or pursuant to a term contract.  The term contracts are generally entered into for a specified period of time and may include minimum revenue, usage or stage requirements.  We are compensated based on a combination of charges for equipment, personnel, materials, mobilization and other items.  
 Equipment — We have pressure pumping equipment used in providing hydraulic fracturing services as well as cementing and acid pumping services, with a total of approximately 1.6 million horsepower as of December 31, 2018.  Pressure pumping equipment at December 31, 2018 included:

Approximate horsepower | | 1,558,500 | | | 77,990 | | 1,636,490

 
Our pressure pumping operations are supported by a fleet of other equipment including blenders, tractors, manifold trailers and numerous trailers for transportation of materials to and from the worksite, as well as bins for storage of materials at the worksite.  
 Materials – Our pressure pumping operations require the use of acids, chemicals, proppants, fluid supplies and other materials, any of which can be in short supply, including severe shortages, from time to time.  We purchase these materials from various suppliers.  These purchases are made in the spot market or pursuant to other arrangements that may not cover all of our required supply.  These supply arrangements sometimes require us to purchase the supply or pay liquidated damages if we do not purchase the material.  Given the limited number of suppliers of certain of our materials, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements if we are unable to reach an agreement with a supplier for delivery of any particular material or should one of our suppliers fail to timely deliver our materials. 
Directional Drilling Operations
 General – We generally utilize our own proprietary downhole motors and equipment to provide a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services, including directional drilling, downhole performance motors, motor rentals, directional surveying, measurement-while-drilling (MWD), and wireline steering tools, in most major onshore oil and natural gas basins in the United States. We generally design, assemble and maintain our own fleet of downhole drilling motors and MWD equipment. We sometimes rent motors and equipment from third parties during periods in which we experience shortages from our vendors, which can occur during periods of increased industry activity. As a complement to our core directional drilling services, we provide downhole survey services and rent our proprietary drilling motors to both oil and natural gas operators and other oilfield service companies. Our customers primarily consist of major integrated energy companies and large North American independent oil and natural gas operators. We believe our customers use our services because of the quality of our specialized, technology-driven equipment and our well-trained and experienced workforce, which enable us to provide our customers with high-quality, reliable and safe directional drilling services.  We utilize our fleet of directional drilling motors, MWD equipment and survey equipment to provide: (1) directional drilling services, (2) third-party motor rentals and (3) downhole survey services.

Directional Drilling Services – We provide our directional drilling services on a day-rate basis, typically under master service agreements.  Revenue from directional drilling services is recognized as work progresses based on the number of days of work completed.  Our day rates and other charges generally vary by location and depend on the equipment and personnel required for the job and market conditions in the region in which the services are performed.  In addition to rates that are charged during periods of active directional drilling, a stand-by rate is typically agreed upon in advance and charged on a daily basis during periods when drilling is temporarily suspended while other on-site activity is conducted at the direction of the operator or another service provider.  
 Third-Party Motor Rental – We rent our drilling motors on an hourly- or day-rate basis to complement our directional drilling services and optimize the utilization of our asset base. Our third-party motor rental revenue is recognized as work progresses based on the number of days or hours our motors are used or are on location.  
 Downhole Survey Services – We provide our downhole survey services on a day-rate, hourly-rate or completed-job basis.  Revenue for our downhole survey services is recognized upon the completion of each day’s work. Our downhole survey services are typically non-contractual.  We normally provide a quote to our customers in advance and then issue an invoice for the downhole survey services provided based on a completed field ticket.
 Equipment – We generally design, assemble, maintain and inspect our own equipment. We sometimes rent motors and equipment from third parties during periods in which we experience shortages from our vendors, which can occur during periods of increased industry activity. We have developed proprietary equipment for our drilling motors, mud pulse and electromagnetic data transfer MWD equipment and survey tools.  We believe that our vertical integration strategy allows us to deliver better operational performance and higher equipment reliability to our customers. Vertical integration also allows us to build our tools more efficiently and at a lower cost than if purchased from third parties. In addition, we have the ability to upgrade our tools in response to market conditions or our customers’ job requirements, which allows us to minimize the costs and delays associated with sending equipment to original manufacturers. Our internal maintenance capability also affords us enhanced control over our supply chain and increases the effective utilization of our assets.  As of December 31, 2018, we had a comprehensive fleet of over 1,600 motors that serve both internal needs and external motor rental requirements.  In addition to our motor fleet, we had 127 MWD systems as well as downhole surveying equipment to provide accurate wellbore surveys.
 Horizontal Wellbore Placement – We provide software and services used to improve the statistical accuracy of horizontal wellbore placement.  Our measurement-while-drilling (MWD) Survey FDIR (fault detection, isolation and recovery) service is a data analytics technology to analyze MWD survey data in real-time and more accurately identify the position of a well.  We provide these services to customers with onshore and offshore operations.  
 Oilfield Rentals
 Our oilfield rentals business has a fleet of premium oilfield rental tools and provides specialized services for land-based oil and natural gas drilling, completion and workover activities.  We offer an extensive line of rental tools, including a full line of tubular products specifically designed for horizontal drilling and completion, with high-torque, premium-connection drill pipe, drill collars and tubing. Additionally, we offer surface rental equipment including blowout preventers, frac tanks, mud tanks and environmental containment that encompass all phases of the hydrocarbon extraction and production process. Our air drilling equipment and services enable extraction in select basins where certain segments of formations preclude the use of drilling fluid, permitting operators to drill through problematic zones without the risk of fluid absorption and damage to the wellbore. We offer oilfield rental services in many of the major producing onshore oil and gas basins in the United States. We price our rentals and services based on the type of equipment being rented and the services being performed. Substantially all rental revenue we earn is based upon a charge for the actual period of time the rental is provided to our customer on a market-based, fixed per-day or per-hour fee.
Other Operations
 We manufacture and sell pipe handling components and related technology for drilling contractors in North America and other select markets, and provide electrical controls and automation to the energy, marine and mining industries, in North America and other select markets.  In addition, we own and invest, as a non-operating working interest owner, in oil and natural gas assets that are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico.
Contracts
 We believe that our contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling, oilfield rentals and other contracts generally provide for indemnification rights and obligations that are customary for the markets in which we conduct those operations.  However, each contract contains the actual terms setting forth our rights and obligations and those of the customer or supplier, any of which rights and obligations may deviate from what is customary due to particular industry conditions, customer or supplier requirements, applicable law or other factors.

Customers 
 Our customer base includes major, independent and other oil and natural gas operators.  With respect to our consolidated operating revenues in 2018, we received approximately 41% from our ten largest customers and approximately 26% from our five largest customers.  During 2018, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated operating revenues.  The loss of, or reduction in business from, one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
Backlog
 Our contract drilling backlog as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $770 million and $544 million, respectively.  Approximately 23% of the total contract drilling backlog at December 31, 2018 is reasonably expected to remain after 2019.  See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included as a part of Item 7 of this Report for information pertaining to backlog.  
Competition 
 The businesses in which we operate are highly competitive.  Historically, available equipment used in these businesses has frequently exceeded demand, particularly in an industry downturn.  The price for our services is a key competitive factor, in part because equipment used in our businesses can be moved from one area to another in response to market conditions.  In addition to price, we believe availability, condition and technical specifications of equipment, quality of personnel, service quality and safety record are key factors in determining which contractor is awarded a job.  We expect that the market for our services will continue to be highly competitive.  
Government and Environmental Regulation 
 All of our operations and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations related to various aspects of our business, including: 

• | drilling of oil and natural gas wells,
--+---------------------------------------


• | hydraulic fracturing, cementing and acidizing and related well servicing activities,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | directional drilling services, third-party motor rentals, and downhole survey services,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | services that improve the statistical accuracy of horizontal wellbore placement, including for customers with offshore operations,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | containment and disposal of hazardous materials, oilfield waste, other waste materials and acids,

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provision of electrical controls and automation, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | our employees.
--+---------------

 To date, applicable environmental laws and regulations in the places in which we operate have not required the expenditure of significant resources outside the ordinary course of business.  We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities or extraordinary expenditures to comply with environmental rules and regulations in the foreseeable future.  However, compliance costs under existing laws or under any new requirements could become material, and we could incur liability in any instance of noncompliance.  
 Our business is generally affected by political developments and by federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations that relate to the oil and natural gas industry.  The adoption of laws, rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry for economic, environmental and other policy reasons could increase costs relating to drilling, completion and production, and otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations.  Federal, state, foreign, regional and local environmental laws, rules and regulations currently apply to our operations and may become more stringent in the future.  Any limitation, suspension or moratorium of the services and products we or others provide, whether or not short-term in nature, by a federal, state, foreign, regional or local governmental authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
 We believe we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry.  However, hydrocarbons and other materials may have been disposed of, or released in or under properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or our predecessors, which may have resulted, or may result, in soil and groundwater contamination in certain locations.  Any contamination found on, under or originating from the properties may be subject to remediation requirements under federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations.  In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties over whom we have no control of their 
 9


treatment of hydrocarbon and other materials or the manner in which they may have disposed of or released such materials.  We could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators.  In addition, it is possible we could be held responsible for oil and natural gas properties in which we own an interest but are not the operator.  
 Some of the environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our business operations are discussed in the following paragraphs, but the discussion does not cover all environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations.  
 In the United States, the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, commonly known as CERCLA, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability on: 
  
• | owners and operators of sites, including prior owners and operators who are no longer active at a site; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of “hazardous substances” found at sites.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), as amended, and comparable state statutes and implementing regulations govern the disposal of “hazardous wastes.” Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from the definition of “hazardous substances,” and RCRA also excludes certain classes of exploration and production wastes from regulation, such exemptions may be deleted, limited, or modified in the future.  For example, in December 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA.  The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking by March 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary.  The EPA has not yet proposed such a rule.  If changes are made to the classification of exploration and production wastes under CERCLA and/or RCRA, we could be required to remove and remediate previously disposed of materials (including materials disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) from properties (including ground water contaminated with hydrocarbons) and to perform removal or remedial actions to prevent future contamination.  
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, each as amended, and implementing regulations govern: 
  
• | the prevention of discharges, including oil and produced water spills, into jurisdictional waters; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | liability for drainage into such waters.
--+-----------------------------------------

 The Oil Pollution Act imposes strict liability for a comprehensive and expansive list of damages from an oil spill into jurisdictional waters from facilities.  Liability may be imposed for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages.  Penalties may also be imposed for violation of federal safety, construction and operating regulations, and for failure to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up.  
 The Oil Pollution Act also expands the authority and capability of the federal government to direct and manage oil spill clean-up and operations, and requires operators to prepare oil spill response plans in cases where it can reasonably be expected that substantial harm will be done to the environment by discharges on or into navigable waters.  Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party, such as us, to civil or criminal actions.  Although the liability for owners and operators is the same under the Federal Water Pollution Act, the damages recoverable under the Oil Pollution Act are potentially much greater and can include natural resource damages.  
 The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) promulgates and enforces laws and regulations governing the protection of the health and safety of employees.  The OSHA hazard communication standard, EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governments and citizens.  Also, OSHA has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety.  
 Our activities include the performance of hydraulic fracturing services to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability, such as shale and other unconventional formations.  Due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, including on groundwater quality and seismic activity, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some state and local jurisdictions have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether.  Such efforts could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the hydraulic fracturing services that we render for our exploration and production customers.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing or Other Aspects of the Oil and Gas Industry Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations.” 
 10


In Canada, a variety of federal, provincial and municipal laws, rules and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances to the environment.  Other jurisdictions where we may conduct operations have similar environmental and regulatory regimes with which we would be required to comply.  These laws, rules and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.  In addition, new projects or changes to existing projects may require the submission and approval of environmental assessments or permit applications.  These laws, rules and regulations are subject to frequent change, and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment.  
 Our operations are also subject to federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations for the control of air emissions, including those associated with the Federal Clean Air Act and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.  We and our customers may be required to make capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.  For more information, please refer to our discussion under “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof, Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.” 
 We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and climate change issues.  We are also aware of legislation proposed by U.S. lawmakers and the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions, as well as GHG emissions regulations enacted by the EPA and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.  We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.  Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Legislation and Regulation of Greenhouse Gases Could Adversely Affect Our Business.” 
 Risks and Insurance 
 Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the businesses in which we operate, including inclement weather, blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, pollution, exposure and reservoir damage.  These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property, as well as significant environmental and reservoir damages.  These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages.  An accident or other event resulting in significant environmental or property damage, or injuries or fatalities involving our employees or other persons could also trigger investigations by federal, state or local authorities. Such an accident or other event could cause us to incur substantial expenses in connection with the investigation, remediation and resolution, as well as cause lasting damage to our reputation, loss of customers and an inability to obtain insurance.
 We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance.  In general, our contracts typically contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage.  Our right to indemnification may, however, be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers.  Our customers and other third parties may dispute, or be unable to meet, their indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons.  Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers and other third parties by contract or indemnification agreements.  Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
 We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs.  The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our equipment and certain other assets, employer’s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability, workers’ compensation and insurance for other specific risks.  We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available, or available on terms that are acceptable to us.  While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, a substantial portion of our equipment and certain other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of such equipment or other assets.  We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies.  For example, we generally maintain a $1.5 million per occurrence deductible on our workers’ compensation insurance coverage, a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our equipment insurance coverage, a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our general liability coverage and a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our automobile liability insurance coverage.  We also self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption and cybersecurity risks, and we do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.  
 11


Our insurance may not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations.  Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions.  As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage.  There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive, or that our coverage will cover a specific loss.  Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.  Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  
 If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable and recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims.  We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.” 
 Employees 
 We had approximately 8,000 full-time employees as of February 8, 2019.  The number of employees fluctuates depending on the current and expected demand for our services.  We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.  None of our employees are represented by a union.  
Seasonality 
 Seasonality has not significantly affected our overall operations.  However, our drilling operations in Canada are subject to slow periods of activity during the annual spring thaw.  Additionally, toward the end of calendar years, we sometimes experience slower activity in our pressure pumping operations in connection with the holidays and as customers’ capital expenditure budgets are depleted.  Occasionally, our operations have been negatively impacted by severe weather conditions.  
Raw Materials and Subcontractors 
 We use many suppliers of raw materials and services.  Although these materials and services have historically been available, there is no assurance that such materials and services will continue to be available on favorable terms or at all.  We also utilize numerous independent subcontractors from various trades.  
 Item 1A. Risk Factors.  
 You should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this Report in evaluating our business and our prospects.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations.  If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed.  You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.  
We Are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas.  Declines in Customers’ Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.  
 We depend on our customers’ willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in North America.  When these expenditures decline, our business may suffer.  Our customers’ willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as: 

• | the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, including current natural gas storage capacity and usage,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the supply of and demand for drilling, pressure pumping and directional drilling services,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the availability of and constraints in pipeline, storage and other transportation capacity in the basins in which we operate,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the environmental, tax and other laws and governmental regulations regarding the exploration, development, production, use and delivery of oil and natural gas, and in particular, public pressure on, and legislative and regulatory interest within, federal, state, foreign, regional and local governments to stop, significantly limit or regulate drilling and pressure pumping activities, including hydraulic fracturing, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 12


 
• | merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In particular, our revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices.  Oil and natural gas prices and markets can be extremely volatile.  Prices, and expectations about future prices, are affected by factors such as: 
  
• | market supply and demand,
--+--------------------------


• | the desire and ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”), its members and other oil-producing nations, such as Russia, to set and maintain production and price targets,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the level of production by OPEC and non-OPEC countries,
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | domestic and international military, political, economic and weather conditions,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | legal and other limitations or restrictions on exportation and/or importation of oil and natural gas,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | technical advances affecting energy consumption and production, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the price and availability of alternative fuels.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 All of these factors are beyond our control.  The closing price of oil was as high as $107.95 per barrel in June 2014.  Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016.  As a result of the lower level of oil prices, our industry experienced a severe decline in activity levels.  While oil and natural gas prices modestly recovered since the first quarter of 2016, and we have experienced an increase in the demand for our services since 2016, our average number of rigs operating remains well below the number of our available rigs, and a portion of our pressure pumping horsepower remains stacked. Oil prices remain volatile, as the closing price of oil reached a fourth quarter 2018 high of $76.40 per barrel on October 3, 2018, before declining by 42% over the course of three months to reach a low of $44.48 per barrel in late December 2018. 
 We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.  Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily result in increased activity because demand for our services is generally driven by our customers’ expectations of future oil and natural gas prices.  A decline in demand for oil and natural gas, prolonged low oil or natural gas prices or expectations of decreases in oil and natural gas prices would likely result in reduced capital expenditures by our customers and decreased demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our services.  
 Global Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.  
 Global economic conditions and volatility in commodity prices may cause our customers to reduce or curtail their drilling and well completion programs, which could result in a decrease in demand for our services.  In addition, uncertainty in the capital markets, whether due to global economic conditions, low commodity prices or otherwise, may result in reduced access to, or an inability to obtain, financing by us, our customers and our suppliers and result in reduced demand for our services.  An economic slowdown or recession in the United States or in any other country that significantly affects the supply of or demand for oil or natural gas could negatively impact our operations and therefore adversely affect our results.  Furthermore, these factors may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability or unwillingness to pay suppliers, including us.  The global economic environment in the past has experienced significant deterioration in a relatively short period, and there is no assurance that the global economic environment will not quickly deteriorate again due to one or more factors, including a decline in the price for oil or natural gas.  A deterioration in the global economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Excess Equipment and a Highly Competitive Oil Service Industry May Adversely Affect Our Utilization and Profit Margins and the Carrying Value of our Assets.  
 The North American land drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive, and at times available land drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment exceed the demand for such equipment.  A low commodity price environment can result in substantially more drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment being available than are needed to meet demand.  In addition, in recent years there has been a substantial increase in the construction of new technology drilling rigs and new pressure pumping equipment and the improvement of existing drilling rigs.  Low commodity prices and construction of new equipment and the improvement of existing drilling rigs can result in excess capacity and substantial competition for a declining number of drilling and pressure pumping contracts.  Even in an environment of high oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity, reactivation and improvement of existing drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, construction of new technology drilling rigs and new pressure pumping equipment, and movement of drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment from region to region in response to market conditions or otherwise can lead to an excess supply of equipment.  
 We periodically seek to increase the prices on our services to offset rising costs and to generate higher returns for our stockholders. However, we operate in a very competitive industry, and we are not always successful in raising or maintaining our existing prices. With the active rig count below the peak seen in 2014 and many rigs, including highly capable AC rigs, and pressure pumping equipment still idle, there is considerable pricing pressure in the industry. Even if we are able to increase our prices, we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset rising costs without adversely affecting our activity levels. The inability to maintain our pricing and to increase our pricing as costs increase could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  In addition, we may be unable to replace fixed-term contracts that were terminated early, extend expiring contracts or obtain new contracts in the spot market, and the rates and other material terms under any new or extended contracts may be on substantially less favorable rates and terms.  
 Accordingly, high competition and excess equipment can cause oil and natural gas service contractors to have difficulty maintaining pricing, utilization and profit margins and, at times, result in operating losses.  We cannot predict the future level of competition or excess equipment in the oil and natural gas service businesses or the level of demand for our contract drilling, pressure pumping or directional drilling services.  
 The excess supply of operable land drilling rigs, increasing rig specialization and excess pressure pumping and directional drilling equipment, which has been exacerbated by a decline in oil and natural gas prices, could affect the fair market value of our drilling, pressure pumping and directional drilling equipment, which in turn could result in additional impairments of our assets.  A prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets and goodwill.  For example, we recognized impairment charges of $277 million and $29 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims.  We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.  
 Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the businesses in which we operate, including inclement weather, blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, pollution, exposure and reservoir damage.  These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property, as well as significant environmental and reservoir damages.  These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages.  An accident or other event resulting in significant environmental or property damage, or injuries or fatalities involving our employees or other persons could also trigger investigations by federal, state or local authorities. Such an accident or other event could cause us to incur substantial expenses in connection with the investigation, remediation and resolution, as well as cause lasting damage to our reputation, loss of customers and an inability to obtain insurance. 
 We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance.  In general, our contracts typically contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage.  Our right to indemnification may, however, be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers.  In addition, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, have enacted statutes generally referred to as “oilfield anti-indemnity acts” expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements.  Such oilfield anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party’s indemnification of us.  
 Our customers and other third parties may dispute, or be unable to meet, their indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons.  Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers and other third parties by contract or indemnification agreements.  Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies.  For example, we generally maintain a $1.5 million per occurrence deductible on our workers’ compensation insurance coverage, a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our equipment insurance coverage, a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our general liability coverage, and a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our automobile liability insurance coverage.  We also self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption and cybersecurity risks, and we do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.

Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.  Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  
 On January 22, 2018, an accident at a drilling site in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma resulted in the losses of life of five people, including three of our employees.  Lawsuits have been filed in the District Court for Pittsburg County, Oklahoma in connection with the five individuals who lost their lives and one of our employees who was injured in the accident.  The lawsuits have been consolidated for discovery purposes under Cause No. CJ-2018-60 (the “Litigation”).  These lawsuits allege various causes of action against us including negligence, gross negligence, knowledge that injury or death was substantially certain, acting with purpose, recklessness, wrongful death and survival, and the plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of damages, including punitive or exemplary damages, costs, interest, and other relief. We dispute the plaintiffs’ allegations and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously.   Based on the information we have available as of the date of this Report, we believe that we have adequate insurance to cover the Litigation.  However, if this accident is not, or another significant accident or other event occurs that is not, fully covered by insurance or an enforceable and recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 
 Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Decline and May Not Ultimately Be Realized, as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.  
 Fixed-term drilling contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an early termination payment to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term.  However, in certain circumstances, for example, destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time, our bankruptcy, or a breach of our contract obligations, the customer may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us.  Additionally, during depressed market conditions or otherwise, customers may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations or may seek to terminate or renegotiate or otherwise fail to honor their contractual obligations.  In addition, we may not be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond our control, and our customers may seek to terminate or renegotiate our contracts for various reasons, including those described above.  As a result, we may be unable to realize all of our current contract drilling backlog.  In addition, the termination or renegotiation of fixed-term contracts without the receipt of early termination payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  As of December 31, 2018, our contract drilling backlog for future revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more, was approximately $770 million.  Please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a description of our calculation of backlog. Our contract drilling backlog may decline, as fixed-term drilling contract coverage over time may not be offset by new contracts or may be reduced by price adjustments to existing contracts, including as a result of the decline in the price of oil and natural gas, capital spending reductions by our customers or other factors.  For these and other reasons, our contract drilling backlog may not generate sufficient liquidity for us during periods of reduced demand for our services.
New Technologies May Cause Our Operating Methods, Equipment and Services to Become Less Competitive, and Higher Levels of Capital Expenditures May Be Necessary to Remain Competitive in Our Industry.  
 The market for our services is characterized by continual technological and process developments that have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the functionality and performance of drilling rigs and pressure pumping and other equipment.  Our customers are increasingly demanding the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs and pressure pumping and other equipment.  Accordingly, a higher level of capital expenditures may be required to maintain and improve existing 
 15


rigs and pressure pumping and other equipment and purchase and construct newer, higher specification drilling rigs and pressure pumping and other equipment to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers.  In addition, technological changes, process improvements and other factors that increase operational efficiencies could continue to result in oil and natural gas wells being drilled and completed more quickly, which could reduce the number of revenue earning days.  Technological and process developments in the pressure pumping and directional drilling businesses could have similar effects.  
 In recent years, we have added drilling rigs to our fleet through new construction, purchased new pressure pumping equipment and acquired a directional drilling services company.  We have also improved existing drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment by adding equipment and technology designed to enhance functionality and performance.  Although we take measures to ensure that we use advanced oil and natural gas drilling, pressure pumping and directional drilling technology, changes in technology, improvements in competitors’ equipment and changes relating to the wells to be drilled and completed could make our equipment less competitive.  
 If we are not successful keeping pace with technological advances in a timely and cost-effective manner, demand for our services may decline.  If any technology that we need to successfully compete is not available to us or that we implement in the future does not work as we expect, we may be adversely affected.  Additionally, new technologies, services or standards could render some of our equipment and services obsolete, which could reduce our competitiveness and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operation.  
 Shortages, Delays in Delivery, and Interruptions in Supply, of Equipment and Materials Could Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.  
 During periods of increased demand for oilfield services, the industry has experienced shortages of equipment for upgrades, drill pipe, replacement parts and other equipment and materials, including, in the case of our pressure pumping operations, proppants, acid, gel and water.  These shortages can cause the price of these items to increase significantly and require that orders for the items be placed well in advance of expected use.  In addition, any interruption in supply could result in significant delays in delivery of equipment and materials or prevent operations.  Interruptions may be caused by, among other reasons: 

• | weather issues, whether short-term such as a hurricane, or long-term such as a drought,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | transportation and other logistical challenges, and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | a shortage in the number of vendors able or willing to provide the necessary equipment and materials, including as a result of commitments of vendors to other customers or third parties or bankruptcies or consolidation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and incur higher operating costs.  Severe shortages, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply could limit our ability to operate, maintain, upgrade and construct our drilling rigs and pressure pumping and other equipment and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  
 Loss of Key Personnel and Competition for Experienced Personnel May Negatively Impact Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 We greatly depend on the efforts of our key employees to manage our operations.  The loss of members of management could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In addition, we utilize highly skilled personnel in operating and supporting our businesses.  In times of increasing demand for our services, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, particularly after a prolonged industry downturn.  During periods of high demand for our services, wage rates for operations personnel are also likely to increase, resulting in higher operating costs.  During periods of lower demand for our services, we may experience reductions in force and voluntary departures of key personnel, which could adversely affect our business and make it more it difficult to meet customer demands when demand for our services improves.  In addition, even if it is generally a period of lower demand for our services, if there is a high demand for our services in certain areas, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel to perform services in such areas.  The loss of key employees, the failure to attract and retain qualified personnel and the increase in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  
The Loss of Large Customers Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  
 With respect to our consolidated operating revenues in 2018, we received approximately 41% from our ten largest customers, 26% from our five largest customers and 8% from our largest customer.  The loss of, or reduction in business from, one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Our Business Is Subject to Cybersecurity Risks and Threats.  
 Our operations are increasingly dependent on information technologies and services.  Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow, and include, among other things, storms and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems, theft, viruses, malware, design defects, human error, or complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded.  Risks associated with these threats include, among other things:

• | theft or misappropriation of funds, including via “phishing” or similar attacks directed at us or our customers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | loss, corruption, or misappropriation of intellectual property, or other proprietary or confidential information (including customer, supplier, or employee data);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | disruption or impairment of our and our customers’ business operations and safety procedures;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | destruction or damage to our and our customers’ equipment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | downtime and loss of revenue;
--+------------------------------


• | injury to our reputation;
--+--------------------------


• | negative impacts on our ability to compete;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risks, cybersecurity attacks and other cyber events are evolving and unpredictable.  Moreover, we have no control over the information technology systems of our customers, suppliers, and others with which our systems may connect and communicate.  As a result, the occurrence of a cyber incident could go unnoticed for a period of time.  Any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
 Growth Through Acquisitions, the Building of New Rigs and Pressure Pumping Equipment and the Development of Technology Is Not Assured.  
 We have grown our drilling rig fleet and pressure pumping fleet and expanded our business lines and use of technology in the past through mergers, acquisitions, new construction and technology development.  For example, we completed the SSE merger and the MS Directional acquisition during 2017.  There can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available in the future or that we will be able to execute timely or efficiently any plans for building new rigs and pressure pumping equipment or developing new technology.  We are also likely to continue to face intense competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities.  In addition, because improved technology has enhanced the ability to recover oil and natural gas, our competitors may continue to build new, high technology rigs and new, high horsepower equipment and develop new technology.  
 There can be no assurance that we will: 
  
• | have sufficient capital resources to complete additional acquisitions, build new rigs or pressure pumping equipment or develop new technology,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | successfully integrate additional drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment, acquired or developed technology or other assets or businesses,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | effectively manage the growth and increased size of our organization, drilling fleet and pressure pumping equipment,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | successfully deploy idle, stacked, upgraded or additional rigs, pressure pumping equipment and acquired or developed technology,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintain the crews necessary to operate additional drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment or the personnel necessary to evaluate, develop and deploy new technology, or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of any completed acquisition, the building of new drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment or the development of new technology.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to integrate acquired businesses and technology and other assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may incur liabilities arising from events prior to any acquisitions, prior to our establishment of adequate compliance oversight or in connection with disputes over acquired or developed technology. While we generally seek to obtain indemnities for liabilities arising from events occurring before such acquisitions, these are limited in amount and duration, may be held to be unenforceable or the seller may not be able to indemnify us.
 We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions, build new drilling rigs or new pressure pumping equipment or develop new technology, and we also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such acquisitions or building program.  Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders.  Also, continued growth could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.  
 Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof, Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.  
 Our business is subject to numerous federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment, protection of the environment and worker health and safety, including, without limitation, laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials, the use of underground storage tanks, and the use of underground injection wells.  The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be substantial.  A failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to: 

• | substantial civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties or judgments,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | modification, denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposition of limitations on our operations, and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | performance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, environmental laws and regulations in the places that we operate impose a variety of requirements on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of spills and liability for damages from such spills.  As an owner and operator of land-based drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, a manufacturer and servicer of equipment and automation to the energy, marine and mining industries and a provider of directional drilling services, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under these laws and regulations.  
 Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and such laws and regulations tend to become more stringent over time.  Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs for us and our customers and have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position.  For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA issued final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPS”) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities.  In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule that updates and expands the New Source Performance Standards by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry. The EPA finalized amendments to some requirements in these standards in February 2018 and September 2018, including rescission of certain requirements and revisions to other requirements such as fugitive emissions monitoring frequency. In November 2016, the EPA announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources and issued information collection requests for oil and natural gas facilities.  That information request was withdrawn in March 2017.  The EPA also published a final rule in June 2016 concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry.  In November 2016, the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued final rules relating to the venting, flaring and leaking of natural gas by oil and natural gas producers who operate on federal and Indian lands.  The rules limited routine flaring of natural gas, require the payment of royalties on avoidable gas losses and require plans or programs relating to gas capture and leak detection and repair. The BLM issued a two-year stay of these requirements in December 2017. In February 2018, the BLM proposed to repeal certain of the requirements of the 2016 methane rules. Several states filed judicial challenges to the BLM’s proposed repeal. In April 2018, a federal court stayed the litigation pending finalization or withdrawal of the BLM’s February 2018 proposal. In September 2018, the BLM published a final rule that largely adopted the February 2018 proposal and rescinded several requirements. The September 2018 rule was challenged in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California almost immediately after issuance. The challenge is still pending.  These or other initiatives could increase costs to us and our customers or reduce demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing or Other Aspects of the Oil and Gas Industry Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations.  
 Members of the U.S. Congress and the EPA are reviewing proposals for more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a technology employed by our pressure pumping business, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production.  For example, the EPA conducted a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater.  As part of this study, the EPA sent requests to a number of companies, including our company, for information on hydraulic fracturing practices.  We responded to the inquiry.  The EPA released its final report in December 2016.  It concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells.  Further, we conduct drilling, pressure pumping and directional drilling activities in numerous states.  Some parties believe that there is a correlation between hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity.  When caused by human activity, such seismic activity is called induced seismicity.  The extent of this correlation, if any, is the subject of studies of both state and federal agencies.  In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed against other industry participants alleging damages and regulatory violations in connection with such activity.  These and other ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and other aspects of the oil and gas industry.
In addition, legislation has been proposed, but not enacted, in the U.S. Congress to amend the SDWA to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process are impairing ground water or causing other damage.  These bills, if enacted, could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal or state level that could limit or delay operational activities or increase operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform or limit hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.  
 Regulatory efforts at the federal level and in many states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations.  The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing using fluids that contain “diesel fuel” under the SDWA Underground Injection Control Program and has released a revised guidance regarding the process for obtaining a permit for hydraulic fracturing involving diesel fuel.  In May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has not yet finalized this rule. Further, in March 2015, the BLM issued a final rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on Indian land. The rule required companies to publicly disclose chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations to the BLM.  However, this rule was rescinded by rule in December 2017.  In June 2016, the EPA published final pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works.  These regulatory initiatives could each spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities.  Certain states where we operate have adopted or are considering disclosure legislation and/or regulations.  For example, Colorado, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Texas and Wyoming have adopted a variety of well construction, set back and disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be performed and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure.  Additional regulation could increase the costs of conducting our business and could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation.  
 In addition, in light of concerns about induced seismicity, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity.  For example, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (“OCC”) has implemented volume reduction plans, and at times required shut-ins, for oil and natural gas disposal wells injecting wastewater into the Arbuckle formation. The OCC also recently released well completion seismicity guidelines for operators in the SCOOP and STACK plays that call for hydraulic fracturing operations to be suspended following earthquakes of certain magnitudes in the vicinity.
 Finally, some jurisdictions have taken steps to enact hydraulic fracturing bans or moratoria.  In June 2015, New York banned high volume fracturing activities combined with horizontal drilling.  Certain communities in Colorado have also enacted bans on hydraulic fracturing.  Voters in the city of Denton, Texas approved a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in November 2014, though it was later lifted in 2015.  These actions have been the subject of legal challenges.  In November 2018, voters rejected an initiative that would have materially restricted hydraulic fracturing activity in Colorado.  
 The adoption of any future federal, state, foreign, regional or local laws that impact permitting requirements for, result in reporting obligations on, or otherwise limit or ban, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and could increase our costs of compliance and doing business and reduce demand for our services.  Regulation that significantly restricts or prohibits hydraulic fracturing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Legislation and Regulation of Greenhouse Gases Could Adversely Affect Our Business 
 We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues.  Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both in the United States and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation.  Some of the proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions.  Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement.  The EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources on an annual basis.  In October 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the GHG monitoring and reporting requirements.  These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells.  The revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities.  Also, in November 2016, the EPA published a final rule adding monitoring methods for detecting leaks from oil and gas equipment and emission factors for leaking equipment to be used to calculate and report GHG emissions resulting from equipment leaks.  In addition, the United States was actively involved in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement.  In April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years.  In June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement unless it is renegotiated.  The State Department informed the United Nations of the United States’ withdrawal in August 2017.  Due to the Paris Agreement’s protocol, the earliest the United States will be able to withdraw is 2020.  However, several states and geographic regions in the United States have adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs.  Additional legislation or regulation by these states and regions, the EPA, and/or any international agreements to which the United States may become a party, that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our operations.  The cost of complying with any new law, regulation or treaty will depend on the details of the particular program.  We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.  Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws or regulations related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas.  
The Design, Manufacture, Sale and Servicing of Products, including Electrical Controls and Rig Components, May Subject Us to Liability for Personal Injury, Property Damage and Environmental Contamination Should Such Equipment Fail to Perform to Specifications.
 We provide products, including electrical controls and rig components such as top drives, to customers involved in oil and gas exploration, development and production and in the marine and mining industries. Because of applications which use our products and services, a failure of such equipment, or a failure of our customer to maintain or operate the equipment properly, could cause harm to our reputation, contractual and warranty-related liability, damage to the equipment, damage to the property of customers and others, personal injury and environmental contamination, leading to claims against us.
Legal Proceedings and Governmental Investigations Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  
 The nature of our business makes us susceptible to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time.  For example, the EPA, OSHA and the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (“CSB”) initiated investigations relating to the January 22, 2018 accident at a drilling site in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma.  The EPA and CSB investigations are ongoing.  In addition, during periods of depressed market conditions, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers, vendors, current and former employees and others initiating legal proceedings against us. Lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Any legal proceedings or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.  Please see “Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims.  We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.”  
 Technology Disputes Could Negatively Impact Our Operations or Increase Our Costs.
 Our services and products use proprietary technology and equipment, which can involve potential infringement of a third party’s rights, or a third party’s infringement of our rights, including patent rights.  The majority of the intellectual property rights relating to our drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and directional drilling services are owned by us or certain of our supplying vendors.  However, in the event that we or one of our customers or supplying vendors becomes involved in a dispute over infringement of intellectual property rights relating to equipment or technology owned or used by us, services performed by us or products provided by us, we may lose access to important equipment or technology or our ability to provide services or products, or we could be required 
 20


to cease use of some equipment or technology or forced to modify our equipment, technology, services or products.  We could also be required to pay license fees or royalties for the use of equipment or technology or provision of services or products.  In addition, we may lose a competitive advantage in the event we are unsuccessful in enforcing our rights against third parties.  Technology disputes involving us or our customers or supplying vendors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
 Political, Economic and Social Instability Risk and Laws Associated with Conducting International Operations Could Adversely Affect Our Opportunities and Future Business.  
 We currently conduct operations in Canada, and we have incurred selling, general and administrative expenses related to the evaluation of and preparation for other international opportunities. Also, we sell products, including rig components and electrical controls, for use in numerous oil and gas producing regions outside of North America. International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties generally not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of social and political unrest, strikes, terrorism, war, kidnapping of employees, nationalization, forced negotiation or modification of contracts, difficulty resolving disputes and enforcing contractual rights, expropriation of equipment as well as expropriation of oil and gas exploration and drilling rights, changes in taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions and restrictions on repatriation of income and capital, currency rate fluctuations, increased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy and industry in the markets in which we may operate, economic and financial instability of national oil companies, and restrictive governmental regulation, bureaucratic delays and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted.  
 There can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements, or the interpretation thereof, which could have a material adverse effect on the cost of entry into international markets, the profitability of international operations or the ability to continue those operations in certain areas.  Because of the impact of local laws, any future international operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities.  While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms we find acceptable.  
 There can be no assurance that we will:
  
• | identify attractive opportunities in international markets,
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | have sufficient capital resources to pursue and consummate international opportunities,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | successfully integrate international drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets or businesses,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | effectively manage the start-up, development and growth of an international organization and assets,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | hire, attract and retain the personnel necessary to successfully conduct international operations, or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | receive awards for work and successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of the entry into one or more international markets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Some parts of the world where contract drilling and pressure pumping activities are conducted or where our consumers for products are located have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practice and could impact business.  Any failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery legislation could subject to us to civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.  We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets.  
 We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance an international transaction or operations, and we also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such transactions or operations.  Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders.  Also, international expansion could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.  
 The occurrence of one or more events arising from the types of risks described above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 21


We Are Dependent Upon Our Subsidiaries to Meet our Obligations Under Our Long-Term Debt.
We have borrowings outstanding under our senior notes and, from time to time, our revolving credit facility.  Our ability to meet our interest and principal payment obligations depends in large part on dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries.  If our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flows to pay us dividends, we may be unable to meet our interest and principal payment obligations.  
Variable Rate Indebtedness Subjects Us to Interest Rate Risk, Which Could Cause Our Debt Service Obligations to Increase Significantly.  
 We have in place a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility.  Interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the credit facility at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate.  The applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 1.00% to 2.00% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 0.00% to 1.00%, in each case determined based upon our credit rating.  As of December 31, 2018, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 1.50% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 0.50%.  As of December 31, 2018, we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
 We have in place a reimbursement agreement pursuant to which we are required to reimburse the issuing bank on demand for any amounts that it has disbursed under any of our letters of credit issued thereunder.  We are obligated to pay the issuing bank interest on all amounts not paid by us on the date of demand or when otherwise due at the LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum.  As of December 31, 2018, no amounts had been disbursed under any letters of credit.
 Interest rates could rise for various reasons in the future and increase our total interest expense, depending upon the amounts borrowed.  
 A Downgrade in Our Credit Rating Could Negatively Impact Our Cost of and Ability to Access Capital.
 Our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by major U.S. credit rating agencies.  Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, commodity pricing levels, industry conditions and other considerations.  A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability in the future to access debt markets, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit for certain obligations.
We May Not Be Able to Generate Sufficient Cash to Service All of Our Debt, Including Our Senior Notes and Debt Under Our Credit Agreement, and We May Be Forced to Take Other Actions to Satisfy Our Obligations Under Our Debt, which May Not Be Successful.
 Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.
 In addition, if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements. In the absence of such cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. However, our Credit Agreement and senior notes contain restrictions on our ability to dispose of assets. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, and any proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.
 22


Anti-takeover Measures in Our Charter Documents and Under State Law Could Discourage an Acquisition and Thereby Affect the Related Purchase Price.  
 We are a Delaware corporation subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law, including Section 203, an anti-takeover law.  Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of that stock without further vote or action by the holders of the common stock.  It also prohibits stockholders from acting by written consent without the holding of a meeting.  In addition, our bylaws impose certain advance notification requirements as to business that can be brought by a stockholder before annual stockholder meetings and as to persons nominated as directors by a stockholder.  As a result of these measures and others, potential acquirers might find it more difficult or be discouraged from attempting to effect an acquisition transaction with us.  This may deprive holders of our securities of certain opportunities to sell or otherwise dispose of the securities at above-market prices pursuant to any such transactions.  
 As a Result of the SSE Merger, We Are Subject to Continuing Contingent Tax Liabilities of Chesapeake Energy Corporation (“CHK”) Following SSE’s Spin-Off from CHK.
 Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and the related rules and regulations, each corporation (or its successor) that was a member of CHK’s consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before June 30, 2014, the effective time of SSE’s spin-off, is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period.  SSE entered into a tax sharing agreement with CHK that generally provides that SSE is responsible for all taxes attributable to its business, whether accruing before, on or after the date of the spin-off, and CHK is responsible for any taxes arising from the spin-off or certain related transactions that are imposed on SSE, CHK or its other subsidiaries. Notwithstanding such agreement, if CHK were unable to pay the taxes it is responsible for, we (as the successor to SSE) could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes under U.S. tax law, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
We May Not Be Able to Utilize a Portion of SSE’s or Our Net Operating Loss Carryforwards (“NOLs”) to Offset Future Taxable Income for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Net Income and Cash Flows.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had gross federal income tax NOLs of approximately $1.3 billion, approximately $247 million of which were assumed in connection with the SSE merger.  Utilization of these NOLs depends on many factors, including our future taxable income, which cannot be predicted with any accuracy. In addition, Section 382 of the Code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of an NOL that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an “ownership change” (as determined under Section 382). Determining the limitations under Section 382 is technical and highly complex. An ownership change generally occurs if one or more shareholders (or groups of shareholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5% of the corporation’s stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period.  In the event that an ownership change has occurred—or were to occur—with respect to a corporation following its recognition of an NOL, utilization of such NOL would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, generally determined by multiplying the value of the corporation’s stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate as defined in Section 382.  However, this annual limitation would be increased under certain circumstances by recognized built-in gains of the corporation existing at the time of the ownership change.  Any unused annual limitation with respect to an NOL generally may be carried over to later years. Any NOL arising prior to January 1, 2018 is subject to expiration 20 years after it arose. NOLs arising on or after January 1, 2018 are not subject to expiration.
 SSE underwent an ownership change in 2016 as a result of its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, and experienced another ownership change in 2017 as a result of its acquisition pursuant to the SSE merger, and the corresponding annual limitation associated with either of those changes in ownership could prevent us from fully utilizing—prior to their expiration—our NOLs relating to SSE as of the effective time of the SSE merger. While our issuance of stock pursuant to the SSE merger was, standing alone, insufficient to result in an ownership change with respect to us, we cannot assure you that we will not undergo an ownership change as a result of the merger taking into account other changes in ownership of our stock occurring within the relevant three-year period described above. If we were to undergo an ownership change, we may be prevented from fully utilizing our NOLs prior to their expiration. Future changes in stock ownership or future regulatory changes could also limit our ability to utilize our NOLs. To the extent we are not able to offset future taxable income with our NOLs, our net income and cash flows may be adversely affected.
