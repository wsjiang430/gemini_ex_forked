Item 1. Business
Overview
Shift Technologies, Inc. ("Shift", the "Company") is a consumer-centric omnichannel retailer transforming the used car industry by leveraging its end-to-end ecommerce platform and retail locations to provide a technology-driven, hassle-free customer experience. 
Formed in 2013 and launched in 2014, Shift started as a pure ecommerce seller and buyer of used cars, aimed at transforming the customer experience within the industry. Since inception, Shift has invested significantly in its technology platform in an effort to create an exceptional customer experience and to support and leverage the internal operations of the Company. 
In August 2022, Shift announced both a strategic and operational restructuring and a merger with CarLotz, Inc. ("CarLotz"), a consignment-to-retail used vehicle marketplace that operated a technology-enabled buying, sourcing, and selling model with an omnichannel experience. With the implementation of the restructuring in the second half of 2022 and the close of the merger on December 9, 2022, Shift evolved into an omnichannel used vehicle retailer and established a plan to position the Company for long-term profitable growth by prioritizing unit economics, reducing operating expenses and maximizing liquidity. 
The Company has three markets in California and Oregon, where customers can test drive vehicles and work with sales associates during any point of the sale process. Each market has Shift-managed reconditioning centers to prepare each vehicle for sale using a 150+ point inspection process. In-house reconditioning provides better control of timing and greater efficiency within our operations. In addition to performing the 150+ point inspection, we offer customers a seven-day, 200-mile return policy, to ensure consumer confidence in their purchase from Shift. 
Following the merger with CarLotz, Shift has adopted an omnichannel distribution strategy. A car purchase can be complicated and is typically one of the largest purchases in an individual’s life. Because diverse buyers and sellers like to transact differently, the omnichannel business model allows Shift to meet our customers where they would like to be served. For those who embrace a fully online experience, Shift has a highly rated end-to-end ecommerce platform. For those who would like personal help, Shift has three markets with trained sales consultants who will walk a customer through the entire research and sales process. 
Shift's approach has always been driven by technology. Our technology enables a superior customer experience and is critical to our scalability in many areas of our operations. 
•The Shift technology platform provides a seamless consumer experience for buying a car - from the search and discover experience on the website to a seamless digitally-driven purchase transaction including financing and vehicle protection products. 
◦The Shift technology platform provides a comprehensive experience for those selling cars as well. Customers go online, enter information about their car, and get an instant online quote. The machine learning-driven acquisition engine predicts the price we will pay for the vehicle, the price at which we can resell the vehicle, the level of reconditioning required to determine impact on margin and operations, and the likelihood that consumers will purchase ancillary products in connection with the sale of the vehicle.
We use proprietary technology in many areas of our operations including inventory acquisition, pricing, and reconditioning processes to improve efficiency and allow us to scale operations. For example, mechanics use an app that displays a step-by-step guide for inspection and reconditioning, while tracking this data in a cloud database for real-time analytics and decision engine processing to provide optimized reconditioning standards.
Industry and Market Opportunity
The U.S. used automotive market is massive, fragmented, and ripe for disruption.
•Massive market: According to Cox Automotive, the U.S. used vehicle market hit an all-time record of 40.9 million units in 2021. At an average selling price in 2021 of approximately $26,700 per Statista, the industry generated over $1 trillion in sales. 
•Highly fragmented: Market share in the US is extremely fragmented with the top 100 used vehicle retailers accounting for only approximately 11.1% of total used car sales in the US, according to Automotive News.
•Ripe for disruption: The used car buying process suffers from poor overall consumer experience, which is attributable to opaque pricing, high pressure sales tactics, inventory of questionable and widely varying quality, and a generally arduous and lengthy sales process. The peer-to-peer market has even greater challenges for consumers including lack of transparency, the possibility of fraud, logistical challenges, limited or no ability to test drive or return vehicles, lack of financing or warranty options.
•Limited ecommerce penetration: The used automotive market remains among the least penetrated ecommerce markets in the US with consumer interest in online auto purchases increasing. According to Data Feed Watch, 61% of US car buyers are open to purchasing online versus only 32% before COVID-19.
•Consumer desire for omnichannel experience: While Shift was founded as a pure e-commerce used auto buyer and seller and has invested heavily in technology to provide a consumer-centric platform, we believe many consumers would like to choose how they shop. According to Auto Success Online, roughly 90% of consumers now expect retail businesses to offer omni-channel experiences and many in the auto industry believe shopping for a car will become a true omnichannel approach, allowing customers to research and build deals online, but still meet someone at a dealership if desired and convenient.
We are focused on the largest segment of the used car market, which comprises inventory between 3 and 10 years of age — a category that makes up approximately 84% of all used vehicle transactions based on a 2019 NIADA report. We believe this makes us well positioned to take market share from legacy auto retailers as its inventory is most heavily concentrated in the deepest pool of demand in the used auto market. In mid-2019, to address a perceived need in the lower price point market, we classified our inventory into two categories, Shift Value and Shift Certified. Shift Value inventory is made up of cars that are over 8 years old or have more than 80,000 miles. Shift Certified inventory consists of vehicles less than 8 years old with less than 80,000 miles. While all vehicles are subjected to the same 150+ point inspection and our high mechanical and safety standards, this segmentation allows us to focus sales and marketing strategies, as well as optimize cosmetic reconditioning costs, for cars with a lower overall purchase price. Consumers seeking Shift Value vehicles are generally less concerned with cosmetic deficiencies; therefore, we have focused our reconditioning on these vehicles to safety and longevity issues, passing on savings to customers while also increasing profitability. This strategy allows us to effectively sell selected older and higher-mileage inventory. In addition, in-house reconditioning provides better control of timing and greater efficiency, especially amongst Shift Value vehicles, and provides the ability to customer standards by distinct categories.

How Shift Delivers on its Mission to Make Car Purchase and Ownership Simple
Shift’s mission is to make car purchase and ownership simple – to make buying or selling a used car fun, fair and accessible to everyone.
•Unique Inventory: We source the vast majority of our vehicles from consumers and third-party consumer facing partners who use the Shift platform. We believe our differentiated ability to purchase vehicles directly from consumer-sellers utilizing proprietary software provides Shift with access to a deep pool of scarce, highly desirable inventory. The proprietary software predicts real-time market-based demand and establishes a profitable market clearing price for the vehicles. Shift’s strategy offers a wide variety of vehicles across the entire spectrum of model, price, age, and mileage to provide the right car for buyers regardless of interest, need, budget, or credit. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Shift sourced 95% of its inventory from consumer-sellers and partners driving improved margins and nearly eliminating reliance on volatile auction markets to source inventory. 
•Omnichannel Experience: We believe customers value convenience and choice in inventory, vehicle products and services, and especially in how they purchase a vehicle. By providing an omnichannel experience, we can deliver the experience the customer chooses and prefers. Our end-to-end ecommerce platform and our three markets in California and Oregon support all experiences. 
◦Buy online: Customers can buy a car sight-unseen without a test drive and have it delivered to their home quickly with the same seven-day, 200-mile return policy as is offered on cars bought in person.
◦In-person at a Shift location: Customers may come to a location to see and test drive multiple cars. Sales consultants on-site can answer questions and walk a customer through the entire search for and purchase of a car. However, if customers would like to search inventory at a location on their own, when they arrive, they can scan a QR code on each car to immediately view all relevant details, including ownership & service history, inspection reports, vehicle history reports, and most importantly, dynamic pricing and market price comparisons, giving customers control in this stage of the search process. 
◦A combination of the online experience and in-person experience at a Shift location. A customer may start a transaction online and, at any point in the process, pick up where they left off at a location and finish in-person. 
•Customized Research and Discovery: The vast majority of consumer auto purchases involve online research. Our continued investments in our research and discovery functionality, including our machine learning-enabled recommendation engine, create a platform that draws customers to engage with the Shift website and provide a seamless search experience. 
•Value-Added Products to Support Ownership: Like other used car dealerships, Shift offers a full suite of products to finance and protect their vehicle. However, unlike traditional used car dealership where these products and services are sold in a high pressured in-person environment, Shift makes this process hassle-free. Products include vehicle service contracts, guaranteed asset protection and wheel and tire coverage. If a customer chooses an in-person experience at one of our locations, a trained sales consultant can walk each customer through the financing and product options in a low-pressure environment, partnering with the customer to find the best products for their situation. If a customer chooses an online experience, we connect customers to various lending partners for a completely digital end-to-end process for financing and service products. A customer can also complete a short online prequalification form and immediately see a filtered view of cars that meet their budget based on the financing options for which they are likely to be able to qualify. Customers can also get approved for financing before they even test drive a car, making it much more likely that the customer will purchase a car from us.
•Easy Tech-Enabled Selling Experience: Shift’s technology makes selling a car just as easy as buying a car. Sellers are able to go to Shift.com, submit information on their car, and get a quote instantly. Shift uses a proprietary algorithm for pricing that utilizes current market information about market conditions, demand and supply, and car option data, among other factors. Using proprietary pricing, Shift provides an immediate quote for a customer’s trade-in vehicle, and will schedule a pickup at the customer’s location. Shift provides selling customers with information on market rates and, when a customer is ready to sell their car, we can digitally initiate e-contracting and an ACH transfer and conveniently take the car on the seller’s behalf so the seller doesn’t even have to leave his or her home to sell their car.
•Exceptional Overall Customer Experience: Shift was born from a dissatisfaction with the traditional used car-buying experience, which can feel time-consuming, stressful, and dishonest. Our goal is to turn what is generally regarded as a burdensome necessity into a delightful and convenient experience. We achieve this by offering customers no-haggle pricing and a “partner not push” buying experience all within our omnichannel sales model. And, unlike many traditional used car dealers, we don’t employ pushy salespeople. 
Competition
The used vehicle market in the United States is highly fragmented, with the top 100 used vehicle retailers accounting for only approximately 11.1% of total used car sales according to Automotive News as well as a large number of transactions occurring in the peer-to-peer market. Competitors in the used vehicle market include:
•traditional new and used car dealerships;
•the peer-to-peer market, utilizing sites such as Facebook, Craigslist, OfferUp, eBay Motors and Nextdoor;
•used car ecommerce businesses or online platforms, mainly Carvana and Vroom; and
•sales by rental car companies directly to consumers of used vehicles which were previously utilized in rental fleets, such as Hertz Car Sales and Enterprise Car Sales.
Our primary competitors, traditional brick-and-mortar used auto dealers, are operating under an outdated business model, which relies on a lack of transparency, high pressure sales tactics, limited inventory, and scarce physical locations to which the customer must travel. These drawbacks in the traditional retail model have allowed ecommerce and omnichannel competitors to rapidly gain share of the used car dealer market in recent years. Additionally, we are well-positioned to gain share from the peer-to-peer market given our focus on acquiring inventory from consumers rather than auctions.
Our Competitive Strengths
•Omnichannel experience: We believe an omnichannel experience broadens our customer base by including all sales channels and increases customer satisfaction by offering convenience and more choices in how they can transact. With these benefits of an omnichannel model, there is opportunity to drive retail unit sales given and increase product attach rate with knowledgeable sales consultants supporting the in-store purchases. 
•Purpose-built ecommerce platform: The Shift platform was built to be an end-to-end online auto solution for consumers who yearn for a differentiated, simple and efficient transaction. The streamlined nature of our business allows for scalability and efficiency in costs compared to our competitors in the auto retail industry, and technology creates a better overall experience for the consumer.
•Consumer-centric technology: Our technology enhances the auto shopping experience while making the process fun and easy compared to the poorly rated experience of dealing with a traditional brick-and-mortar dealer. Most customers begin their car search online and spend most of their car-shopping experience online. Therefore, we believe the best way to enhance the overall process is to provide a digitally driven omnichannel approach to not only begin, but seamlessly complete, the car-buying experience online.
•Exceptional Customer Experience: Customer response to the Shift experience is extremely positive, resulting in a rating of 4.1 out of 5 starts on Trustpilot as of March 2023, compared to an average review of 2.6 out of 5 stars for our two largest ecommerce peers. These positive experiences are expected to allow Shift to serve customers over the entire lifecycle of vehicle ownership and retain customers for repeat sales and purchases. By continuing to invest in services that benefit the customer throughout the ownership phase of the lifecycle, we will continue to establish a long-term customer base that we expect will return for future transactions, thereby reducing our customer acquisition costs over time. 
•Broad Inventory Selection Including the Shift Value Segment: We believe that a differentiated ability to purchase vehicles directly from consumer-sellers as compared to our competitors, who purchase a higher percentage through the wholesale market and OEMs, provides Shift access to a deeper pool of scarce, highly desirable inventory. In addition, our data-driven vehicle evaluations help ensure acquisition of the right inventory at the right price to reduce days to sale. 
Our unique acquisition strategy allows us to offer inventory that includes a wide spectrum of ages and price, rather than focusing exclusively on newer and more expensive cars. We focus on vehicle models over five years old, with selling prices that are accessible to a broader array of customers. We also have a differentiated “Shift Value” segment of vehicles which are over eight years old or have more than 80,000 miles. This category of inventory is highly desirable to a large market segment, and counter-cyclical, with demand increasing in poor economic conditions. Our inventory is thus diverse enough and better positioned to weather a down economy and shifting consumer preferences. We believe that to be successful in the value segment, it is critical to own the reconditioning process in our markets and offer consumers a test drive option at a Shift location during the purchase process. 
Our Growth Strategies and Path to Profitability
During 2022, to improve the financial performance of the business and the Company’s liquidity position, Shift implemented the Project Focus Restructuring Plan (the "Restructuring Plan") in August 2022 and acquired CarLotz in December 2022. The Restructuring Plan outlined a plan to position the Company for long-term profitable growth by prioritizing unit economics, reducing operating expenses, and maximizing liquidity.
•Improve Unit Economics: Our short-term priority is to achieve positive unit economics including customer acquisition costs through gross profit per unit ("GPU") expansion and leveraging selling and marketing expenses. To achieve this goal, first, we are carefully managing our vehicle acquisition costs in the volatile pricing environment using our proprietary software and algorithms. Second, we are optimizing marketing spend through focusing on lower-funnel activities to drive higher conversion and targeting more efficient customer acquisition channels. And third, we believe the addition of in-person selling as part of our omnichannel selling experience will drive higher conversion rates for cars and products. 
•Increase Market Penetration in Existing Markets: Our plan is to increase share in existing markets given the large and highly fragmented industry in which we operate. We are focused on our mature markets where we can leverage our large markets with reconditioning facilities and brand recognition to drive retail unit sales. We believe our omnichannel model has appeal to a broader base of customers who would like to have choice in how they transact.
•Geographic Expansion: We currently operate three markets in California and Oregon. Over time, we will evaluate entering new markets that meet our requirements for regional market demand, desirable real estate to deliver our omnichannel experience, and estimated store economics.
•Enhanced Cost Control: The Company has taken significant steps to right-size the cost structure for the omnichannel business model and will manage costs judiciously to achieve long-term profitable growth. 
•Support Vehicle Ownership Throughout the Entire Lifecycle and Capitalize on Ancillary Product Offering: We offer service, maintenance, and repair work at each of our three markets in an effort to support the entire lifecycle of vehicle ownership. We seek to become the single company consumers think of every time they want to do anything with a car — buy, sell, service or protect — to make car ownership simple. The service and maintenance business has the opportunity to add recurring revenue and gross profit while increasing customer loyalty and reducing future customer acquisition costs.
•Leverage Scalable Proprietary Marketplace and Logistics Platform: Not only do we use our technology to buy, sell, and maintain the cars we sell through our own markets, but we have also built modular, scalable proprietary technology solutions for a logistics management and mobile transactions platform that can be leveraged by other car sellers including other dealers. Our vision is to evolve into a true platform marketplace that lists and fulfills third-party inventory, enabling traditional dealers to modernize through this platform and those who might otherwise build a traditional dealership channel to make use of the Shift platform instead. By becoming the online destination for consumers who want to buy or sell a car, we also plan to become the platform for dealers who want to transact with those consumers. 
•Accelerate Growth Through Strategic M&A: The market for used cars is highly fragmented. We intend to consider acquisitions that further our strategy of developing an omnichannel distribution platform, combining digital delivery and strategic retail presence.
Marketing
We believe our customer base is representative of the overall market for used cars as our vehicles cover the full spectrum of used car price points. Our sales and marketing efforts utilize a multi-channel approach, built on a seasonality-adjusted, market-based model budget. We direct marketing to both buyers and sellers, which is part of why we are able to acquire a majority of our inventory directly from customers. We believe our strong customer focus ensures customer loyalty which will drive both repeat purchases and referrals. We drive Buyer and Seller traffic to the Shift platform with SEM, Paid Social, SEO, and Affiliate programs. In addition, for Buyer, we also leverage third-party auto lead sources to drive traffic.
Service Providers
We utilize several top banking partners to finance purchases of our vehicles by customers who desire or need such financing. We also offer value-added products to our customers through third-party partners, including vehicle service contracts, guaranteed asset protection and wheel and tire coverage. None of these third-party partners are individually significant to our operations.
Seasonality
We expect our quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, gross profit, profitability, if any, and cash flow to vary significantly in the future, based in part on, among other things, consumers’ car buying patterns. We have typically experienced higher revenue growth rates in the second and third quarters of the calendar year than in each of the first or fourth quarters of the calendar year. We believe these results are due to seasonal buying patterns driven in part by the timing of income tax refunds, which we believe are an important source of car buyer down payments on used vehicle purchases. However, we recognize that in the future our revenues may be affected by these seasonal trends (including any disruptions to normal seasonal trends arising from the COVID-19 pandemic), as well as cyclical trends affecting the overall economy, specifically the automotive retail industry.
Intellectual Property
The protection of our technology and other intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property through patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law, as well as confidentiality agreements, other contractual commitments and security procedures. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our technology and other proprietary information.
We own one issued U.S. patent and have one pending U.S. patent application. We also have an application pending to register Shift™ as a trademark in the United States. We regularly review our technology development efforts and branding strategy to identify and assess the protection of new intellectual property.
Intellectual property laws, contractual commitments and security procedures provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Further, intellectual property laws vary from country to country, and we have not sought patents or trademark registrations outside of the United States. Therefore, in other jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect certain of our proprietary technology, brands, or other intellectual property.
Government Regulation
Our business is and will continue to be subject to extensive U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. The advertising, sale, purchase, financing and transportation of used vehicles are regulated by every state in which we operate and by the U.S. federal government. We also are subject to state laws related to titling and registration and wholesale vehicle sales, and our sale of value-added products is subject to state licensing requirements, as well as federal and state consumer protection laws. These laws can vary significantly from state to state. In addition, we are subject to regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and ecommerce and the collection, storage and use of personal information and other customer data. We are also subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunities Act and prohibitions against unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The federal governmental agencies that regulate our business and have the authority to enforce such regulations and laws against us include the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. For example, the FTC has jurisdiction to investigate and enforce our compliance with certain consumer protection laws and has brought enforcement actions against auto dealers relating to a broad range of practices, including the sale and financing of value-added or add-on products. Additionally, we are subject to regulation by individual state dealer licensing authorities, state consumer protection agencies and state financial regulatory agencies. We also are subject to audit by such state regulatory authorities.
State dealer licensing authorities regulate the purchase and sale of used vehicles by dealers within their respective states. The applicability of these regulatory and legal compliance obligations to our ecommerce business is dependent on evolving interpretations of these laws and regulations and how our operations are, or are not, subject to them. We are licensed as a dealer in California and Oregon and all of our vehicle transactions are conducted under our California and Oregon licenses. We believe that our activities in other states are not currently subject to their vehicle dealer licensing laws, however if we determine that obtaining a license in another state is necessary, either due to expansion or otherwise, we may not be able to obtain such a license within the timeframe we expect or at all.
Some states regulate retail installment sales, including setting a maximum interest rate, caps on certain fees or maximum amounts financed. In addition, certain states require that retail installment sellers file a notice of intent or have a sales finance license or an installment sellers license in order to solicit or originate installment sales in that state. All of our installment sale transactions are currently conducted under our California or Oregon dealer licenses. However, as we seek to expand to other states, we may be required to obtain additional licenses and our ability to do so cannot be assured.
In addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to the sale and financing of used vehicles, our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, occupational health and safety, and other broadly applicable business regulations. We also are subject to laws and regulations involving taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, pricing, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, mobile communications, consumer protection, information-reporting requirements, unencumbered internet access to our platform, the design and operation of websites and internet neutrality. In connection with the closing of the merger, we are also now subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies, including securities laws and exchange listing rules.
For a discussion of the various risks we face from regulation and compliance matters, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Insurance
We maintain insurance policies to cover directors’ and officers’ liability, fiduciary, crime, property, workers’ compensation, automobile, cyber, general liability and umbrella insurance.
All of our insurance policies are with third-party carriers and syndicates with financial ratings of A or better. We and our global insurance broker regularly review our insurance policies and believe the premiums, deductibles, coverage limits and scope of coverage under such policies are reasonable and appropriate for our business.
Employees
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had an average of approximately 970 employees. As of March 30, 2023 we had approximately 360 full-time employees. As discussed further in Note 16 - Impairment and Restructuring to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, headcount has been reduced pursuant to a Restructuring Plan and scaled to match a reduced geographic footprint. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
