ITEM 1. — BUSINESS
Overview
We are a fully integrated frac sand supply and services company, offering complete mine to wellsite solutions for our customers. We produce low-cost, high quality Northern White raw frac sand, which is a premium proppant used to enhance hydrocarbon recovery rates in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells. We also offer proppant logistics solutions to our customers through our in-basin transloading terminal and wellsite storage capabilities. We currently market our products and services primarily to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and oilfield service companies and sell our products under a combination of long-term take-or-pay contracts and spot sales in the open market. We believe that the size and favorable geologic characteristics of our sand reserves, the strategic location and logistical advantages of our facilities, our proprietary portable wellsite storage solutions and the industry experience of our senior management team have positioned us as a highly attractive provider of raw frac sand and proppant logistics services from the mine to the wellsite. 
We own and operate a raw frac sand mine and related processing facility near Oakdale, Wisconsin, at which we have approximately 317 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves as of December 31, 2018. We incorporated in Delaware in July 2011 and began operations with 1.1 million tons of annual nameplate processing capacity in July 2012. After several expansions, our current annual nameplate processing capacity at our Oakdale facility is approximately 5.5 million tons of raw frac sand. Our integrated Oakdale facility, with on-site rail infrastructure and wet and dry sand processing facilities, has access to two Class I rail lines and enables us to process and cost effectively deliver products to our customers. 
On March 15, 2018, we acquired the rights to operate a unit train capable transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota to service the Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin. We paid cash consideration of approximately $15.5 million to acquire certain assets at the Van Hook terminal, and entered into a long-term lease agreement in connection with the transaction. As part of this transaction, we entered into a long-term agreement with Canadian Pacific Railway to service the Van Hook terminal directly along with the other key oil and natural gas exploration and production basins of North America.  The Van Hook terminal became operational in April 2018. Since operations commenced, we have been providing Northern White sand in-basin at this terminal to our customers. We believe this new terminal provides us with an opportunity to expand our customer base and offer more efficient delivery options to customers operating in the Williston Basin.
On June 1, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Quickthree Solutions, Inc. (“Quickthree”), a manufacturer of portable vertical proppant storage solution systems. We paid cash consideration of approximately $30.0 million at closing and up to $12.8 million in potential earn-out payments, which are to be paid as system components are built and made available for sale or lease over a three-year period from the acquisition date. We believe that this acquisition provides us with the technology, production capacity and management team to compete further in the proppant logistics market and will provide us with an opportunity to expand our customer base by being able to offer proppant logistics services all the way to the wellsite.
We own a second property in Jackson County, Wisconsin, which we call the Hixton site. The Hixton site is also located adjacent to a Class I rail line and is fully permitted to initiate operations and is available for future development. As of December 31, 2018, our Hixton site had approximately 100 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves. We have no immediate plans to further develop this site.
We also hold two long-term surface mining leases for properties located in the Permian Basin in Texas that are available for future development.  The first site consists of 1,772 acres in Winkler County, Texas.  This location is adjacent to the Texas & New Mexico Railway (TXN) short line with direct access to State Highway 18.  The second site consists of 2,447 acres in Crane County, Texas. This location has direct access to Interstate Highway 20. The Permian Basin sites have been acquired for a combined cost of less than $5.0 million and have low associated ongoing costs. Based on our preliminary testing, we believe there are sufficient quantities on these sites to establish reserves in the future. We have no immediate plans to develop these sites.
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we generated net income of approximately $18.7 million, $21.5 million and $10.4 million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $66.0 million, $30.6 million and $37.8 million, respectively. For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), please read “Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  For more financial information about our business, please read “Selected Financial Data.”
From early 2017 through the second quarter of 2018, improvements in oil and natural gas prices created a more stable market environment. During the second half of 2018, the demand for Northern White sand decreased, which we believe was due primarily to insufficient takeaway capacity for the incremental oil and natural gas production coming online in the Permian 
6

Basin, along with increased availability of regional sand as a source of proppant in the Permian basin. Additionally, oil and natural gas companies reduced their spending in the latter portion of the year due to strong spending in the first half of 2018 and lower oil prices, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our spot sales continued at decreased rates through the second half of 2018, and we agreed to temporary price adjustments under certain of our long-term agreements. In general, we received term extensions in exchange for such price adjustments. Otherwise, the contractual terms under our long-term agreements have not changed materially. In general, customers under long-term take-or-pay contracts are required to make periodic shortfall payments if their contracted volumes are not taken, which we recognize as revenue in our results of operations in the period in which the obligation becomes due. Contracted volumes decreased in the fourth quarter of 2018, which resulted in additional shortfall revenue. 
Northern White raw frac sand, which is found predominantly in Wisconsin and limited portions of Minnesota and Illinois, is considered a premium proppant due to its favorable physical characteristics. While we anticipate that regional sand may affect the demand for Northern White sand in some of the oil and natural gas operating basins in which we operate, we believe there will continue to be demand for our high-quality Northern White raw frac sand. We expect demand for our frac sand to grow from customers who are focused on long-term well performance and ultimate recovery of reserves from the oil and natural gas wells they are completing as well as those interested in the efficiency of their logistics supply chain and delivery of sand to the wellsite. Additionally, we believe the development of North America’s unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs will continue to grow and increased proppant usage per well trends will continue, particularly with respect to finer mesh sizes. We expect the trend of using larger volumes of finer mesh materials, such as 100 mesh sand and 40/70 mesh sand, to continue.
Competitive Strengths
We believe that we will be able to successfully execute our business strategies because of the following competitive strengths:

• | Long-lived, strategically located, high-quality reserve base. We believe our Oakdale facility is one of the few raw frac sand mine and production facilities that has the unique combination of a large high-quality reserve base of primarily fine mesh sand that is contiguous to its production and primary rail loading facilities. We have an implied proven reserve life of approximately 58 years based on our current annual nameplate processing capacity of 5.5 million tons. We believe that with further development and permitting, the Oakdale facility ultimately could be expanded to allow production of up to 9 million tons of raw frac sand per year.

We believe our reserve base positions us well to take advantage of current market trends of increasing demand for finer mesh raw frac sand. We also believe that having our mine, processing facilities and primary rail loading facilities at our Oakdale facility provides us with an overall low-cost structure, which enables us to compete effectively for sales of Northern White raw frac sand and to achieve attractive operating margins. The proximity of our mine, processing plants and primary rail loading facilities at one location eliminates the need for us to truck sand on public roads between the mine and the production facility or between wet and drying processing facilities, eliminating additional costs to produce and ship our sand.

• | Intrinsic logistics advantage. We believe that we are one of the few raw frac sand producers with a facility custom-designed for the specific purpose of delivering raw frac sand to all of the major U.S. oil and natural gas producing basins by an on-site rail facility that can simultaneously accommodate multiple unit trains. Our on-site transportation assets at Oakdale include approximately nine miles of rail track in a triple-loop configuration and four railcar loading facilities that are connected to a Class I rail line owned by Canadian Pacific. We believe our customized on-site logistical configuration yields lower operating and transportation costs compared to manifest train or single-unit train facilities as a result of our higher railcar utilization, more efficient use of locomotive power and more predictable movement of product between mine and destination. In addition, we have a transload facility on a Class I rail line owned by Union Pacific in Byron Township, Wisconsin, approximately three miles from the Oakdale facility. This transload facility, which is capable of handling multiple unit trains simultaneously, allows us to ship sand directly to our customers on more than one Class I rail carrier. We believe that we are the only sand facility in Wisconsin that has dual served rail capabilities, which should create competition among our rail carriers and allow us to provide more competitive logistics options for our customers.


• | Expanded logistics solutions. Our recently acquired transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota, became operational in April 2018. This terminal is capable of handling multiple unit trains simultaneously, and we have been providing in-basin sand at this terminal to our customers since operations began in April 2018. We believe this new terminal provides us with an opportunity to expand our customer base and offer more efficient delivery options to customers operating in the Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin. We believe our recent acquisition of Quickthree provides us with the technology, production capacity and management team to compete further in the 

7

proppant logistics market and will provide us with an opportunity to expand our customer base by being able to offer proppant logistics services all the way to the wellsite.

• | Ample liquidity and financial flexibility. We believe we have ample liquidity to pursue our growth initiatives. As of December 31, 2018, we have cash on hand of $1.5 million and undrawn availability of $15.5 million on our $60.0 million Credit Facility. In February 2019, we entered into an agreement with the existing lenders on our Credit Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility to June 30, 2020 and also to reduce the total capacity to $50.0 million by December 31, 2019. Additionally, we have entered into various financing arrangements which allow us to borrow an additional $14.2 million. We intend to utilize these funds to continue the manufacturing of our wellsite proppant storage solutions equipment. Additionally, 13% of our railcar fleet comes off lease in 2019, which allows us additional flexibility to manage costs should reduced activity continue.


• | Focus on safety and environmental stewardship. We are committed to maintaining a culture that prioritizes safety, the environment and our relationship with the communities in which we operate, which we believe is critical to the success of our business. In August 2014, we were accepted as a “Tier 1” participant in Wisconsin’s voluntary “Green Tier” program, which encourages, recognizes and rewards companies for voluntarily exceeding environmental, health and safety legal requirements. In addition, we committed to certification under ISO standards and, in April 2016, we received ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 registrations for our quality management system and environmental management system programs, respectively. In 2018, we received two awards for lowest injury rate for medium sized companies from the Industrial Mineral Association. We are one of a select group of companies who are members of the Wisconsin Industrial Sand Association, which promotes safe and environmentally responsible sand mining standards.


• | Experienced management team. The members of our senior management team bring significant experience to the market environment in which we operate. Their expertise covers a range of disciplines, including industry-specific operating and technical knowledge and experience managing high-growth businesses.

Business Strategies
Our principal business objective is to provide a fully-integrated sand and logistics solution to our customers and increase stockholder value. We expect to achieve this objective through the following business strategies:

• | Expanding and optimizing our logistics infrastructure and developing additional origination and destination points. We intend to further optimize our logistics infrastructure and develop additional origination and destination points. We expect to capitalize on our Oakdale facility’s ability to simultaneously accommodate multiple unit trains on-site with the Canadian Pacific rail network and ship on two Class I rail carriers to maximize our product shipment rates, increase our railcar utilization and lower our transportation costs. Through our transloading facility located on the Union Pacific rail network approximately three miles from our Oakdale facility, we have the ability to ship our raw frac sand directly to our customers on more than one Class I rail carrier. This facility provides increased delivery options for our customers, greater competition among our rail carriers and potentially lower freight costs. In 2018, we added a new multi-unit train capable terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota, which we believe allows us to be one of the most efficient and low-cost sources of raw frac sand in the Bakken formation in the Williston Basin. We also acquired a manufacturer of portable vertical frac sand silo equipment, which will allow us to expand the logistics services we can provide all the way to the wellsite for our customers.

The benefits of our long-term growth strategy for in-basin delivery of sand include new contracted customers by marketing through our own terminal, more opportunity for spot sales by forward deploying sand and the opportunity to capture incremental margin on the sale of sand farther down the supply chain by managing the cost of rail, terminal and wellsite storage operations. Additionally, having a presence in-basin gives us an opportunity to have a base of operations from which to market our wellsite solutions. We believe our wellsite storage solutions compare favorably to our competitors in that:

i. | our portable silos can be set up or taken down rapidly;


ii. | our trailers detach, which reduces their footprint on the wellsite;


iii. | our storage silos include industry-leading passive and active dust suppression technology; and


iv. | our patented system has the capability of a gravity-fed operation and when used in combination with our Quickload system, our silos can be filled by both pneumatic and gravity dump trailers.

Through the expansion of our wellsite storage solutions fleet and other logistics options, we continue evaluating ways to reduce the landed cost of our products in the basin and to the wellsite for our customers while increasing our customized service offerings to provide our customers with additional delivery and pricing alternatives, including selling product on an “as-delivered” basis to the wellsite.

• | Focusing on organic growth by increasing our utilization of our existing facility. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to maximize the value and the utilization of our Oakdale facility in Wisconsin as a producer of high-quality Northern White raw frac sand through the addition of new contracted volumes. Despite the emergence of regional sand in the Permian basin, we believe the proppant market continues to offer attractive long-term growth fundamentals for Northern White raw frac sand due to its superior results as a proppant outweighing the incremental cost savings of regional sand. 

According to Spears and Associates, Inc. (“Spears”), demand in 2018, in North American basins, increased approximately 33% over 2017 levels and demand in 2019 is expected to increase 4% over 2018 levels. Spears estimates that over the next two years, proppant demand is projected to grow from 98 million tons per year in 2018 to 120 million tons per year in 2020, as exploration and production operators drilling for oil and natural gas continue to increase their use of horizontal drilling and continue to increase the volume of proppant per well drilled through longer lateral well lengths and increased proppant per lateral foot drilled.  Additionally, we believe raw frac sand will continue to be a preferred proppant by operators over resin-coated and manufactured ceramics due to the cost advantages. 

• | Focusing on being a low-cost producer and continuing to make process improvements. We will continue to focus on being a low-cost producer, which we believe will permit us to compete effectively for sales of raw frac sand and to achieve attractive operating margins. Our low-cost structure results from a number of key attributes, including, among others, our (i) relatively low royalty rates, (ii) balance of coarse and fine mineral reserve deposits and corresponding contractual demand that minimizes yield loss, and (iii) Oakdale facility’s proximity to two Class I rail lines and other sand logistics infrastructure. We have strategically designed our operations to provide for low-cost production. For example, as part of our recent Oakdale expansion, we enclosed two dryers and one wet plant in a single building to allow these processing plants to operate on a year-round basis. This should allow us to more efficiently match our wet sand production with our drying capacity and to better utilize our workforce with a goal to reduce the overall cost of production. In addition, we seek to maximize our mining yields on an ongoing basis by targeting sales volumes that more closely match our reserve gradation in order to minimize mining and processing of superfluous tonnage. We also continue to evaluate other mining techniques to reduce the overall cost of our mining operations.


• | Creating flexible sales activities. We believe that demand for our products will remain strong in basins where regional sand is not widely available, such as the Bakken in North Dakota and Marcellus and Utica formations in the Northeast region of the United States. We continue to have discussions with operators in these regions regarding new relationship and growth opportunities. We also believe that the long-term benefits of high quality Northern White sand outweighs the short-term cost savings provided by regional sand in the Permian basin. We believe there are additional opportunities for customers in the Permian and other basins, which have regional supply, who are focused on the long-term performance of their production and on the long-term efficiency of the logistics of their supply needs.

Our Customers and Contracts
We sell raw frac sand under long-term take-or-pay contracts as well as in the spot market if we have excess production and the spot market conditions are favorable. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 58% of our current annual nameplate capacity of 5.5 million tons is under contract with a volume-weighted average remaining term of approximately 2 years.
Demand for proppants through the first half of 2016 dropped due to the downturn in commodity prices originating in late 2014 and the corresponding reduction in oil and natural gas drilling, completion and production activity. The change in demand during this period impacted contract discussions and negotiated terms with our customers as existing contracts were adjusted, resulting in a combination of reduced average selling prices per ton, and adjustments to take-or-pay volumes and lengths of contracts. We believe we have mitigated the short-term negative impact on revenues of some of these adjustments through contractual shortfall and reservation payments. During the market downturn, customers began to purchase more volumes on a spot basis as compared to committing to long-term contracts, and this trend continued until oil and natural gas drilling and completion activity began to increase beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. In 2017, drilling and completion activity returned to higher levels, which led customers to more actively consider contracting proppant volumes under term contracts rather than continuing to rely on buying proppant on a spot basis in the market. From early 2017 through the second quarter of 2018, improvements in oil and natural gas prices created a more stable market environment. During the second half of 2018, the demand for Northern White sand decreased, which we believe was due primarily to insufficient takeaway capacity for the incremental oil and natural gas production coming online in the Permian Basin, along with increased availability of regional sand as a source of proppant in the Permian basin. Additionally, oil and natural gas companies reduced their spending in the latter portion of the year due to strong spending in the first half of 2018 and lower oil prices, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our spot sales continued at decreased rates through the second half of 2018, and we have agreed to temporary price adjustments, typically in exchange for term extensions under certain of our long-term agreements. The contractual terms 
9

under our long-term agreements have not otherwise materially changed. In general, customers under long-term take-or-pay contracts are required to make periodic shortfall payments, which we recognize as revenue in our results of operations in the period in which the obligation becomes due. Contracted volumes decreased in the fourth quarter of 2018, resulting in additional shortfall revenue. 
Our core customers are oil and natural gas exploration and production and oilfield service companies. These customers have signed long-term take-or-pay contracts, which mitigate our risk of non-performance by such customers. Our contracts provide for a true-up payment in the event the customer does not take delivery of the minimum volume of raw frac sand specified in the contract and, in some cases, has not purchased in certain prior periods an amount exceeding the minimum volume, resulting in a shortfall. The true-up payment is designed to compensate us, at least in part, for our margins for the applicable contract period and is calculated by multiplying the contract price (or, in many cases, a discounted contract price) by the tonnage shortfall. Any sales of the shortfall volumes to other customers on the spot market would provide us with additional margin on these volumes. Additionally, some of our contracts include monthly reservation charges that the customer is required to pay for minimum monthly volumes regardless of whether the customer takes delivery of the sand. For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales to Liberty, EQT, WPX Energy, and Hess accounted for 22.8%, 21.4%, 11.6%, and 10.6%, respectively, of total revenue, and the remainder of our revenues represented sales to twenty customers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Rice Energy, Liberty, Weatherford, and US Well Services accounted for 27.1%, 20.6%, 13.7%, and 10.2%, respectively, of our total revenues, and the remainder of our revenues represented sales to sixteen customers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, EOG Resources, Weatherford, US Well Services, and Nabors Completion & Production Services accounted for 37.5%, 25.2%, 22.4%, and 10.8%, respectively, of our total revenues, and the remainder of our revenues represented sales to five customers. Please read “Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in Our Business—A substantial majority of our revenues have been generated under contracts with a limited number of customers, and the loss of, material nonpayment or nonperformance by or significant reduction in purchases by any of them could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.” For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we generated approximately 80.1%, 79.8%, and 97.6%, respectively, of our revenues from raw frac sand delivered under long-term take-or-pay contracts.
Certain of our contracts include variable product prices indexed to the price of crude oil (based upon the average price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil (“WTI”) as listed on www.eia.doe.gov).  Many of our contracts also contain provisions allowing for monetary adjustment including: (i) annual percentage price escalators, or (ii) market factor increases (and in some cases decreases), including a natural gas surcharge/reduction and/or a propane surcharge/reduction which are applied if the Average Natural Gas Price or the Average Quarterly Mont Belvieu TX Propane Spot Price, respectively, as listed by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, are above or below the applicable benchmark set forth in the contract for the preceding calendar quarter.
Our contracts generally provide that, if we are unable to deliver the contracted minimum volume of raw frac sand, the customer has the right to purchase replacement raw frac sand from alternative sources, provided that our inability to supply is not the result of an excusable delay. In the event that the price of replacement raw frac sand exceeds the contract price and our inability to supply the contracted minimum volume is not the result of an excusable delay, we are responsible for the price difference, up to a specified limit. At December 31, 2018, we had significant levels of raw frac sand inventory on hand; therefore, we consider the likelihood of any such penalties as remote.
Certain of our contracts allow the customer to defer a portion of the annual minimum volume to future contract years, subject to a maximum deferral amount. The mesh size specifications in our contracts vary and include a mix of 20/40, 30/50, 40/70 and 100 mesh raw frac sand. In the event that one or more of our current contract customers decides not to continue purchasing our raw frac sand following the expiration of its contract with us, we believe that we will be able to sell the volume of sand that they previously purchased to other customers through long-term contracts or sales on the spot market.
Capital Plans
We expect to continue expanding our manufactured wellsite proppant storage solutions and evaluate other proposed projects and related expenditures, such as investments in transload facilities located in various operating basins, in light of customer demand and energy market trends. There can be no assurance, however, that all or any of these initiatives will be executed or that the results therefrom will be materially beneficial to our financial performance.
Industry Trends Impacting Our Business
Unless otherwise indicated, the information set forth under “—Industry Trends Impacting Our Business,” including all statistical data and related forecasts, is derived from Spears’ “Proppant Market Report with Frac Market Overview - Q4 2018” published in the first quarter of 2019. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the proppant industry data presented herein, estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors.”

Demand Trends
According to Spears, the North American proppant market, including raw frac sand, ceramic and resin-coated proppant, was approximately 98 million tons in 2018, which is a 33% increase over the 74 million tons Spears reported for 2017. Spears estimates that 2019 demand will increase 4% and 2020 demand will increase another 14%, representing an increase of approximately 25 million tons in proppant demand over the next two years. 

 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019E | 2020E 
New US Horizontal Wells | 20,819 | 14,413 | 8,599 | 13,116 | 15,691 | 14,840 | 15,233
Proppant Demand (Mil Tons) | 67 | 52 | 40 | 74 | 98 | 101 | 120 

Demand growth for raw frac sand and other proppants is primarily driven by advancements in oil and natural gas drilling and well completion technology and techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. These advancements have made the extraction of oil and natural gas increasingly cost-effective in formations that historically would have been uneconomic to develop. More proppant is being used per well, which is driving the increase in proppant demand despite horizontal drilling activity stabilizing. Spears estimates that proppant demand will reach approximately 101 million tons in 2019 and 120 million tons in 2020. Spears also estimates that average proppant usage per well was approximately 5,800 tons per well in 2018 and will rise to approximately 7,400 tons per well by the end of 2020.
Supply Trends
In 2018, significant sand capacity was added in numerous regions, primarily in the Permian Basin. The total mine capacity outpaced customer demand for raw frac sand leading to an over-supplied market, which has put pricing pressure on raw frac sand pricing. Several factors contributed to this supply surplus, including overdevelopment of new sand mines in response to the prior year shortage, increase in the usage of local sand, and logistical challenges on delivering sand in the higher quantities required by the new higher proppant intensity wells.
Supplies of high-quality Northern White raw frac sand are limited to select areas, predominantly in western Wisconsin and limited areas of Minnesota and Illinois. The ability to obtain large contiguous reserves in these areas is a key constraint and can be an important supply consideration when assessing the economic viability of a potential raw frac sand facility. Further constraining the supply and throughput of Northern White raw frac sand is that not all of the large reserve mines have on-site excavation, processing or logistics capabilities. Historically, much of the capital investment in Northern White raw frac sand mines was used to develop coarser deposits in western Wisconsin, which is inconsistent with the increasing demand for finer mesh raw frac sand in recent years. As such, we’ve seen competitors in the Northern White frac sand market reduce their capacity by shuttering or idling operations as the shift to finer sands in hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells erodes the ongoing economic viability of producing coarser grades of sand.
11

Permits
We operate in a highly regulated environment overseen by many government regulatory and enforcement bodies at the local, state and federal levels. To conduct our mining operations, we are required to have obtained permits and approvals that address environmental, land use and safety issues at our Oakdale facility, Byron transload facility and our Hixton mine location. Our current and planned areas for excavation at our Oakdale property are permitted for extraction of our proven reserves. Portions of our Oakdale property lie in areas designated as wetlands, which will require additional local, state and federal permits prior to mining and reclaiming those areas.
We also meet requirements for several international standards concerning safety, greenhouse gases and rail operations. We have voluntarily agreed to meet the standards of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources’ “Green Tier” program, the “National Industrial Sand Association” (“NISA”) and the “Wisconsin Industrial Sand Association.” Further, we have agreed to meet the standards required to maintain our ISO 9001-2015 and ISO 14001-2015 quality/environmental management system registrations. These voluntary requirements are tracked and managed along with our permits. 
While resources invested in securing permits are significant, this cost has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We cannot ensure that existing environmental laws and regulations will not be reinterpreted or revised or that new environmental laws and regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional environmental requirements that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Major Stockholder
Our largest stockholder is Clearlake Capital Group, L.P., which, together with its affiliates and related persons, we refer to as Clearlake. Clearlake is a leading private investment firm founded in 2006. With a sector-focused approach, the firm seeks to partner with world-class management teams by providing patient, long-term capital to dynamic businesses that can benefit from Clearlake’s operational improvement approach, O.P.S.®. The firm’s core target sectors are industrials and energy; software, and technology-enabled services; and consumer. Clearlake has managed approximately $8 billion of institutional capital since inception and its senior investment principals have led or co-led over 100 investments. We believe our relationship with Clearlake provides us with a unique resource to effectively compete for acquisitions within the industry by being able to take advantage of their experience in acquiring businesses to assist us in seeking out, evaluating and closing attractive acquisition opportunities over time.
Competition
The proppant industry is highly competitive. Please read “Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in Our Business—We face significant competition that may cause us to lose market share.” There are numerous large and small producers in all sand producing regions of North America with whom we compete, many of which also offer solutions for unloading, storing and delivering proppant to the wellsite. Our main competitors include Badger Mining Corporation, Emerge Energy Services LP, Hi-Crush Partners LP, Covia Holdings Corporation, U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc., Black Mountain Sand, Vista Proppants and Logistics, Atlas Sand, and Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure, Inc.
Although some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, we believe that we are well-positioned competitively due to our patented wellsite solutions which offer numerous benefits over our competition, low cost of sand production, logistics infrastructure and high-quality, balanced reserve profile. The most important factors on which we compete are the performance of patented wellsite storage solutions technology, service capabilities, product quality, proven performance, sand characteristics, transportation capabilities, reliability of supply, price and logistics services. Demand for raw frac sand and logistics solutions and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our products, to the extent not subject to a fixed price or take-or-pay contract, are closely linked to proppant consumption patterns for the completion of oil and natural gas wells in North America. These consumption patterns are influenced by numerous factors, including, among other things, the price for oil and natural gas and hydraulic fracturing activity, including the number of stages completed and the amount of proppant used per stage. Further, these consumption patterns are also influenced by the location, quality, price and availability of raw frac sand and other types of proppants such as resin-coated sand and ceramic proppant. 
Seasonality
Our business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations in weather that impact the production levels for a portion of our wet processing plant capacity. While our dry plants are able to process finished product volumes evenly throughout the year, our excavation and our wet sand processing activities have historically been limited to primarily non-winter months. As a consequence, we have experienced lower cash operating costs in the first and fourth quarter of each calendar year, and higher cash operating costs in the second and third quarter of each calendar year when we overproduced to meet demand in the winter months.  These higher cash operating costs were capitalized into inventory and expensed when these tons are sold, which can lead to us having higher overall costs in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year as we expense inventory costs that were previously capitalized. However, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we finished construction 
12

of one of our new wet plants, which is an indoor facility that allows us to produce wet sand inventory year-round to support a portion of our dry sand processing capacity, which may reduce certain of the effects of this seasonality. We may also sell raw frac sand for use in oil and natural gas producing basins where severe weather conditions may curtail drilling activities and, as a result, our sales volumes to those areas may be reduced during such severe weather periods. For a discussion of the impact of weather on our operations, please read “Risk Factors—Seasonal and severe weather conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition” and “Risk Factors—Our cash flow fluctuates on a seasonal basis.”
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property primarily consists of trade secrets, know-how and trademarks. We own patents and have patent applications pending related to our portable wellsite storage solutions. All of the issued patents have an expiration date after July 2030. With respect to our other products, we principally rely on trade secrets, rather than patents, to protect our proprietary processes, methods, documentation and other technologies, as well as certain other business information. 
Insurance
We believe that our insurance coverage is customary for the industry in which we operate and adequate for our business. As is customary in the proppant industry, we review our safety equipment and procedures and carry insurance against most, but not all, risks of our business. Losses and liabilities not covered by insurance would increase our costs. To address the hazards inherent in our business, we maintain insurance coverage that includes physical damage coverage, third-party general liability insurance, employer’s liability, business interruption, environmental and pollution and other coverage, although coverage for environmental and pollution-related losses is subject to significant limitations.
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
We are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of worker health, safety and the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. Private parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. In addition, the trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, these laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly pollution control equipment, the occurrence of delays in the permitting or performance of projects, or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.
We do not believe that compliance by us with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows. We cannot be assured, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions adverse to our operations will not cause us to incur significant costs. The following is a discussion of material environmental and worker health and safety laws, as amended from time to time that relate to our operations or those of our customers that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Air Emissions
Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and related state and local laws, which restrict the emission of air pollutants and impose permitting, monitoring and reporting requirements on various sources. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or to address other air emissions-related issues. Changing and increasingly stringent requirements, future non-compliance, or failure to maintain necessary permits or other authorizations could require us to incur substantial costs or suspend or terminate our operations.
Climate Change
In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHG”). It presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate legislation will be passed by either house of Congress in the near future. However, a number of states are addressing GHG emissions, primarily through the development of emission inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control GHG emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations. Independent of Congress, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has adopted regulations controlling GHG emissions under its existing authority. Compliance with new legislation may require us to incur substantial costs or suspend or terminate our operations.

Water Discharges
The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into state waters or waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by the Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) pursuant to an appropriately issued permit. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Compliance with new rules and legislation could require us to face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for expansion activities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
Hydraulic Fracturing
We supply raw frac sand to hydraulic fracturing operators in the oil and natural gas industry. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and increasingly common practice that is used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas from low permeability hydrocarbon bearing subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, proppants, and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock, increase permeability and stimulate production. Although we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, our customers purchase our raw frac sand for use in their hydraulic fracturing activities. 
The adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal or state levels imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting or delaying, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells, increase our customers’ costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our raw frac sand. 
Non-Hazardous and Hazardous Wastes
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws control the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. These laws and regulations govern the generation, storage, treatment, transfer and disposal of wastes that we generate. In the course of our operations, we generate waste that are regulated as non-hazardous wastes and hazardous wastes, obligating us to comply with applicable standards relating to the management and disposal of such wastes. In addition, drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our customers’ costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes and a corresponding decrease in their drilling operations, which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Site Remediation
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”) and comparable state laws impose strict, joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner and operator of a disposal site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of remediating the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. We have not received notification that we may be potentially responsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA at any site.
Endangered Species
The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. As a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) was required to consider listing numerous species as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act before the completion of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. The FWS did not meet the deadline. Current ESA listings and the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we or our customers operate could cause us or our customers to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures and could result in delays or limitations in our or 
14

our customers’ performance of operations, which could adversely affect or reduce demand for our raw frac sand. For example, the dunes sagebrush lizard, which is found only in the active and semi-stable shinnery oak dunes of southeastern New Mexico and adjacent portions of Texas, was a candidate species for listing under the ESA by the FWS for many years.  In 2010, the FWS proposed listing the dunes sagebrush lizard as an endangered species under the ESA.  In response, the Texas Comptroller’s Office created the Texas Conservation Plan (“TCP”) in 2012 to minimize disturbances to the dunes sagebrush lizard’s habitat.  Our site in Crane County, Texas has been included in the TCP. In June 2012, the FWS declined to list the species as endangered under the ESA. Currently, the Texas Comptroller’s Office is working with the FWS to replace the TCP with a new Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances (“CCAA”) that includes an updated habitat map. FWS will review the draft CCAA and the Texas Comptroller’s Office has indicated on its website that it expects the CCAA to receive final approval by spring 2019.
Mining and Workplace Safety
Our sand mining operations are subject to mining safety regulation. The U.S. Mining Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) is the primary regulatory organization governing raw frac sand mining and processing. Accordingly, MSHA regulates quarries, surface mines, underground mines and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with and located at quarries and mines. The mission of MSHA is to administer the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and to enforce compliance with mandatory miner safety and health standards. As part of MSHA’s oversight, representatives perform at least two unannounced inspections annually for each above-ground facility.
OSHA has promulgated new rules for workplace exposure to respirable silica for several other industries. Respirable silica is a known health hazard for workers exposed over long periods. MSHA is expected to adopt similar rules as part of its “Long Term Items” for rulemaking. Airborne respirable silica is associated with work areas at our site and is monitored closely through routine testing and MSHA inspection. If the workplace exposure limit is lowered significantly, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for equipment to reduce this exposure. Smart Sand also adheres to the NISA’s respiratory protection program, and ensures that workers are provided with fitted respirators and ongoing radiological monitoring.
Environmental Reviews
Our operations may be subject to broad environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended, (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all “major federal actions” significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The granting of a federal permit for a major development project, such as a mining operation, may be considered a “major federal action” that requires review under NEPA. As part of this evaluation, the federal agency considers a broad array of environmental impacts, including, among other things, impacts on air quality, water quality, wildlife (including threatened and endangered species), historic and archeological resources, geology, socioeconomics, and aesthetics. NEPA also requires the consideration of alternatives to the project. The NEPA review process, especially the preparation of a full environmental impact statement, can be time consuming and expensive. The purpose of the NEPA review process is to inform federal agencies’ decision-making on whether federal approval should be granted for a project and to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of a proposed project. Though NEPA requires only that an environmental evaluation be conducted and does not mandate a particular result, a federal agency could decide to deny a permit or impose certain conditions on its approval, based on its environmental review under NEPA, or a third party could challenge the adequacy of a NEPA review and thereby delay the issuance of a federal permit or approval.
State and Local Regulation
We are subject to a variety of state and local environmental review and permitting requirements. Some states, including Wisconsin where our current projects are located, have state laws similar to NEPA; thus, our development of a new site or the expansion of an existing site may be subject to comprehensive state environmental reviews even if it is not subject to NEPA. In some cases, the state environmental review may be more stringent than the federal review. Our operations may require state-law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project’s impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations, and scenic areas. Wisconsin has specific permitting and review processes for commercial silica mining operations, and state agencies may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. The development of new sites and our existing operations also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building, and transportation requirements.
Demand for raw frac sand in the oil and natural gas industry drove a significant increase in the production of frac sand. As a result, some local communities expressed concern regarding silica sand mining operations. These concerns have generally included exposure to ambient silica sand dust, truck traffic, water usage and blasting. In response, certain state and local communities have developed or are in the process of developing regulations or zoning restrictions intended to minimize dust from becoming airborne, control the flow of truck traffic, significantly curtail the amount of practicable area for mining activities, provide compensation to local residents for potential impacts of mining activities and, in some cases, ban issuance of new permits for mining activities. To date, we have not experienced any material impact to our existing mining operations or 
15

planned capacity expansions as a result of these types of concerns. We would expect this trend to continue as oil and natural gas production increases.
In August 2014, we were accepted as a Tier 1 participant in Wisconsin’s voluntary Green Tier program, which encourages, recognizes and rewards companies for voluntarily exceeding environmental, health and safety legal requirements. Successful Tier 1 participants are required to demonstrate a strong record of environmental compliance, develop and implement an environmental management system meeting certain criteria, conduct and submit annual performance reviews to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, promptly correct any findings of non-compliance discovered during these annual performance reviews, and make certain commitments regarding future environmental program improvements. Our most recent annual report required under the Tier 1 protocol was submitted to the Green Tier Program contact on August 1, 2018.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 323 people. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
