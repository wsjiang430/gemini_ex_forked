 Our History 
 Our business was named MagnaChip Semiconductor when it was acquired from SK hynix Inc., formerly known as Hynix Semiconductor, Inc. (SK hynix), in October 2004. We refer to this acquisition as the Original Acquisition. 
 On March 10, 2011, we completed our initial public offering. In connection with our initial public offering, we converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation. 
 Our Products and Services 
 Our Display Solutions line of products provides flat panel display solutions to major suppliers of large and small flat panel displays. These products include source and gate drivers and timing controllers that cover a wide range of flat panel displays used in high definition (HD), full high definition (FHD), ultra high definition (UHD), light emitting diode (LED), 3D and organic light emitting diodes (OLED) televisions and displays, notebooks and mobile communications and entertainment devices. Our Display Solutions line of products support the industrys most advanced display technologies, such as OLEDs, and low temperature polysilicons thin film transistor (LTPS TFT), as well as high-volume display technologies such as amorphous silicon thin film transistors (a-Si TFTs). Our Display Solutions products represented 34.1%, 30.8% and 41.0% of our net sales for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 We expanded our business and market opportunity by establishing our Power Solutions product line in late 2007. We have introduced a number of power management semiconductor products, including discrete and integrated circuit solutions for power management in high-volume consumer applications. These products include metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), AC-DC converters, DC-DC converters, LED drivers, switching regulators and linear regulators for a range of devices, including televisions, smartphones, mobile phones, desktop PCs, notebooks, tablet PCs, other consumer electronics, and industrial applications such as power suppliers, e-bike, photovoltaic inverter, LED lighting, motor drive and home appliances. Our Power Solutions products represented 22.5%, 22.0% and 19.1% of our net sales for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 Through our Foundry Services Group, we also offer foundry services to fabless analog and mixed-signal semiconductor companies and IDMs that require differentiated, specialty analog and mixed-signal process technologies. Our process technologies are optimized for analog and mixed-signal devices and include standard complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS), high voltage CMOS, ultra-low leakage high voltage CMOS and bipolar complementary double-diffused metal oxide semiconductor (BCDMOS) and electronically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM). Our Foundry Services Group customers use us to manufacture a wide range of products, including display drivers, LED drivers, audio encoding and decoding devices, microcontrollers, touch screen controllers, RF switches, park distance control sensors for automotive, electronic tag memories and power management semiconductors. Our Foundry Services Group business represented 43.3%, 47.1% and 39.8% of our net sales for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 We manufacture the majority of our products at our two fabrication facilities located in Korea. We have approximately 508 proprietary process flows we can utilize for our products and offer to our Foundry Services Group customers. Our manufacturing base serves both our display driver and power management businesses and Foundry Services Group customers, allowing us to optimize our asset utilization and leverage our investments across our product and service offerings. Analog and mixed-signal manufacturing facilities and processes are typically distinguished by design and process implementation expertise rather than the use of the most advanced equipment. These processes also tend to migrate more slowly to smaller geometries due to technological barriers and increased costs. For example, some of our products use high-voltage technology that requires larger geometries and that may not migrate to smaller geometries for several years, if at all. As a result, our manufacturing base and strategy do not require substantial investment in leading edge process equipment, allowing us to utilize our facilities and equipment over an extended period of time with moderate required capital investments.

Display Solutions 
 Display Driver Characteristics. Display drivers deliver defined analog voltages and currents that activate pixels to exhibit images on displays. The following key characteristics determine display driver performance and end-market application: 

 | Resolution and Number of Channels. Resolution determines the level of detail displayed within an image and is defined by the number of pixels per line multiplied by the number of lines on a display. For large displays, higher resolution typically requires more display drivers for each panel. Display drivers that have a greater number of channels, however, generally require fewer display drivers for each panel and command a higher selling price per unit. Mobile displays, conversely, are typically single chip solutions designed to deliver a specific resolution. We cover resolutions ranging from VGA (640 x 480) to UHD (3840 x 2160).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Color Depth. Color depth is the number of colors that can be displayed on a panel. For example, for TFT-LCD panels, 262 thousand colors are supported by 6-bit source drivers; 16 million colors are supported by 8-bit source drivers; and 1 billion colors are supported by 10-bit source drivers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Operational Voltage. Display drivers are characterized by input and output voltages. Source drivers typically operate at input voltages from 1.62 to 3.6 volts and output voltages between 9 and 18 volts. Gate drivers typically operate at input voltages from 1.62 to 3.6 volts and output voltages from 30 to 45 volts. Lower input voltage results in lower power consumption and electromagnetic interference (EMI).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Gamma Curve. The relationship between the light passing through a pixel and the voltage applied to the pixel by the source driver is referred to as the gamma curve. The gamma curve of the source driver can correct some imperfections in picture quality in a process generally known as gamma correction. Some advanced display drivers feature up to three independent gamma curves to facilitate this correction.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Driver Interface. Driver interface refers to the connection between the timing controller and the display drivers. Display drivers increasingly require higher bandwidth interface technology to address the larger data transfer rate necessary for higher definition images. The principal types of interface technologies are embedded
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Intellectual Property 
 As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio of intellectual property assets included approximately 2,678 registered patents and 307 pending patent applications. Approximately 1,948 and 137 of our patents and pending applications, respectively, are novel in that they are not a foreign counterpart of an existing patent or patent application. Because we file patents in multiple jurisdictions, we additionally have approximately 730 registered patents and 170 pending applications that relate to identical technical claims in our base patent portfolio. Our patents expire at various times approximately over the next 19 years. While these patents are in the aggregate important to our competitive position, we do not believe that any single registered or pending patent is material to us. 
 We have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses and development agreements with third parties relating to the use of intellectual property of the third parties in our products and design processes, including licenses related to embedded memory technology, design tools, process simulation tools, circuit designs and processor cores. Some of these licenses, including our agreements with Silicon Works Co., Ltd. and ARM Limited, are material to our business and may be terminated by the licensors prior to the expiration of these licenses should we fail to cure any breach under such licenses. Our license with Silicon Works Co., Ltd. relates to our large display drivers, and our license from ARM Limited primarily relates to product lines in our Foundry Services Group business. The loss of either license could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Additionally, in connection with the Original Acquisition, SK hynix retained a perpetual license to use the intellectual property that we acquired from SK hynix in the Original Acquisition. Under this license, SK hynix and its subsidiaries are free to develop products that may incorporate or embody intellectual property developed by us prior to October 2004. 
Competition 
 We operate in highly competitive markets characterized by rapid technological change and continually advancing customer requirements. Although no one company competes with us in all of our product lines, we face significant competition in each of our market segments. Our competitors include other independent and captive manufacturers and designers of analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits, including display driver and power management semiconductor devices, as well as companies providing specialty manufacturing services. 
 We compete based on design experience, manufacturing capabilities, the ability to service customer needs from the design phase through the shipping of a completed product, length of design cycle and quality of technical support and sales personnel. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on internal and external variables, both within and outside of our control. These variables include the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies, product performance and quality, manufacturing yields, capacity availability, customer service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends. 
 Employees 
 Our worldwide workforce consisted of 2,515 employees (full- and part-time) as of December 31, 2018, of which 346 were involved in sales, marketing, general and administrative, 419 in research and development (including 194 with advanced degrees), 103 in quality, reliability and assurance and 1,647 in manufacturing (comprised of 256 in engineering and 1,391 in operations). As of December 31, 2018, our workforce consisted of 2,515 employees, of which 1,479 employees, or approximately 59% of our workforce, were represented by the MagnaChip Semiconductor Labor Union. 
Environmental 
 We are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the 
 
15 


  generation, use, handling, storage and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous substances (including asbestos) and waste, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Since 2015, our Korean subsidiary has been subject to a new set of greenhouse gas emissions regulation, the Korean Emissions Trading Scheme, or K-ETS, under the Act on Allocation and Trading of Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowances. Under K-ETS, our Korean subsidiary was allocated a certain amount of emissions allowance in accordance with the National Allocation Plan prepared by the Korean government and is required to meet its allocated target by either reducing the emission or purchasing the allowances from other participants in the emission trading market. Another example is the newly reinforced regulations on chemicals under Chemicals Control Act and K-REACH, which came into effect on January 1, 2015. Under these laws, our Korean subsidiary is required to comply with various requirements to report, evaluate, manage and ensure the safe usage of the chemicals used in its facilities. There can be no assurance that we have been or will be in compliance with all of these laws and regulations, or that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these laws and regulations in the future. The adoption of new environmental, health and safety laws and the failure to comply with new or existing laws or issues relating to hazardous substances could subject us to material liability (including substantial fines or penalties), impose the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements upon us, curtail our operations or restrict our ability to expand operations. 
 Raw Materials 
 We use processes that require specialized raw materials that are generally available from a limited number of suppliers. We continue to attempt to qualify additional suppliers for our raw materials. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, adopted new disclosure regulations for public companies that manufacture products containing certain minerals that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These conflict minerals are commonly found in metals used in the manufacture of semiconductors. The implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of metals used in the manufacture of our products. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our BusinessCompliance with new regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain raw materials used in manufacturing our products.
