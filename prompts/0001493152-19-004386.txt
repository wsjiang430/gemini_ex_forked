Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. (the “Company” or “Cocrystal”) is a biotechnology company seeking to discover and develop novel antiviral therapeutics as treatments for serious and/or chronic viral diseases. We employ unique structure-based technologies and Nobel Prize winning expertise to create first- and best-in-class antiviral drugs. These technologies are designed to efficiently deliver small molecule therapeutics that are safe, effective and convenient to administer. We have identified promising preclinical and early clinical stage antiviral compounds for unmet medical needs including influenza, Hepatitis C virus (“HCV”), and norovirus infections.
 
The Company operates in one segment. Management uses cash flows as the primary measure to manage its business and does not segment its business for internal reporting or decision-making.
 
Cocrystal Technology
 
We are developing antiviral therapeutics that inhibit the essential replication function of various viruses. One of our goals is to decrease the duration of HCV therapy by advancing drug candidates targeting the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme. Additional goals include treating human and avian (bird) influenza virus and norovirus infections by discovering and developing drug candidates targeting the viral replication complex. To discover and design these inhibitors, we use a proprietary platform comprising computation, medicinal chemistry, X-ray crystallography, and our extensive know-how. We determine the structures of cocrystals containing the inhibitors bound to the enzyme or protein to guide our design. We also use advanced computational methods to screen and design product candidates using proprietary cocrystal structural information. In designing the candidates, we seek to anticipate and avert potential viral mutations leading to resistance. By designing and selecting drug candidates that interrupt the viral replication process and also have specific binding characteristics, we seek to develop drugs that are not only effective against both the virus and possible mutants of the virus, but which also have reduced off-target interactions that cause undesirable clinical side effects. This approach requires an extensive knowledge of viruses and drug targets to carry out. In addition, knowledge and experience in the fields of structural biology, and enzymology are required. We developed our proprietary structure-based drug design under the guidance of Dr. Roger Kornberg, our Chief Scientist and recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2006. Our drug discovery process focuses on those parts of the enzymes to which drugs bind and on drug-enzyme interactions at the atomic level. Additionally, we have developed proprietary targeted in-house chemical libraries of non-nucleoside inhibitors, metal-binding inhibitors, and drug-like fragments. Our drug discovery process is different from traditional, empirical, medicinal chemistry approaches that often require iterative high-throughput compound screening and lengthy hit-to-lead processes. We continue developing preclinical and clinical drug candidates using our proprietary drug discovery technology.
 
The Company’s proprietary technology integrates several powerful and specialized techniques:
 

(1) | Selection of viral drug targets amenable to broad-spectrum antiviral drug development and essential for viral genome replication; 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | Atomic resolution 3-D structure determination of drug binding pockets; 
(3) | In-depth computational analysis of conservation of drug-binding pockets and critical molecular interactions between antiviral inhibitors and amino acid residues of the target molecule’s drug-binding pocket; 
(4) | Cocrystal structure determinations to inform hit identification, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization processes; 
(5) | Molecular modeling and computer-guided lead discovery to support rational chemical modifications based on structure-activity relationships, or SAR, of candidate inhibitor compounds;

(6) | Knowledge of enzymatic mechanisms to guide the design of drugs with exceptional affinity, specificity, and broad-spectrum activity; and 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(7) | Platforms for rapid identification of antiviral enzyme inhibitors showing broad-spectrum antiviral capability. 

 
We have applied these techniques to develop antiviral inhibitors of three important viruses: HCV, influenza, and norovirus.
 
Market-Driven Product Profiles
 
In all of our programs our goal is to develop best-in-class broad-spectrum antiviral drugs with high-barrier-to-drug resistance. An ideal product for an antiviral therapy would have at least the following characteristics:

(1) | Fast onset of action and/or shortened therapeutic time; 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | Good safety and tolerability profile; 
(3) | Effective against all viral subtypes that cause disease; 
(4) | High barrier to viral resistance; and 
(5) | Ease of administration, for example, a pill. 

 
Even at the discovery stage of drug development, we select compounds with these factors in mind. Furthermore, our technology is capable of delivering therapies that satisfy all of these key factors, as detailed below.
 
In order to improve patient care and penetrate the HCV marketplace, drugs are needed with faster onset of viral load reduction resulting in shorter treatment time. Current and known future influenza treatments shorten symptoms by only about 24 hours.
 
Norovirus spreads readily among the affected and is in need of a fast-acting therapeutic intervention. During the discovery and development phases we focus on this important clinical variable.
 
Safety and tolerability: All drugs have side effects, also referred to as adverse effects. These usually result from a drug’s ability to bind to human molecules (usually proteins). When this interaction is intentional (i.e., part of the drug’s mechanism of action), the adverse effects are classified as on-target effects. When this interaction is unintentional (i.e., resulting from the drug’s interaction with an unintended human molecule), the effects are called off-target effects. Our inhibitors target viral replication enzymes, which are generally unique to viruses. Because the targets are viral, not human, minimal adverse effects are possible. During the discovery phase, we evaluate candidate compounds for potential cross-reactivity with human replication enzymes and attempt to eliminate those compounds that are cross-reactive with humans.
 
Broadly effective against major strains responsible for a viral disease: For any given viral disease, there are different strains of viruses that cause the disease. For example, there are six major strains of the virus known to cause HCV. These strains are termed “genotypes.” Each HCV genotype is common in some parts of the world and rare in others. Also, there are three types of influenza viruses, A, B, and C. Influenza A and B viruses are significant human respiratory pathogens that cause seasonal flu. Influenza A viruses can also cause an influenza pandemic. Influenza C is a subtype of the influenza virus that tends to cause only mild illness, and is not responsible for seasonal or pandemic infections. Our goal is to design and develop drug candidates that will be effective on the broadest possible range of viruses causing the disease.
 
Many antiviral drugs available today are effective only against certain strains of viruses and less effective or not effective at all against other strains. To address this problem, we are developing drug candidates that specifically target viral proteins involved in viral replication. Despite the various strains of virus that may exist, these replication enzymes are essentially identical (highly conserved) among all strains of a given virus. By targeting these conserved replication enzymes, our antiviral compounds are designed and tested to be effective against major virus strains. Replication enzymes are generally conserved not only among subtypes of a given virus but also among many different viruses, creating an opportunity for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.

High barrier to drug resistance: Drug resistance is a major obstacle to developing effective antiviral therapies. Viruses can reproduce rapidly and in enormous quantities in infected human cells. During viral replication, random changes in the viral genome, called mutations, spontaneously develop. If such a mutation occurs in a region of the viral genome that is targeted by a given antiviral therapy, that therapy may no longer be effective against the mutated virus. These mutated or “resistant” viruses can freely infect and multiply even in individuals who have received drug treatment. In some cases, resistant virus strains may even predominate. For example, in the 2009 swine influenza pandemic, the predominant strain was resistant to the best available therapies.
 
The Company’s focus on viral replication proteins can overcome the obstacle of viral resistance. We identify and target critical components of viral replication proteins that are essential for function, therefore, sensitive to change. A mutation in these critical components is likely to inactivate the replication protein and, in turn, render the virus incapable of replicating. Because such mutations cannot propagate, the virus cannot effectively develop resistance to the enzyme inhibitors we employ. We test the effectiveness of our compounds against potential viral mutations and select compounds with the highest barrier to resistance.
 
Ease of administration: We select compounds for development that can be administered orally, preferably once daily in pill-form.
 
Research and Development Update
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018 and to date in 2019, the Company focused its research and development efforts primarily in three areas:
 
Hepatitis C
 
CC-31244, our HCV Non-Nucleoside Polymerase Inhibitor (“NNI”), is a potential best-in-class pan-genotypic inhibitor of NS5B polymerase for the treatment of HCV infection. It has the potential to be an important component in an all-oral ultra-short HCV combination therapy. The Company filed an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on February 28, 2018 and received notice from the FDA on March 29, 2018 that its IND was now open and the Company was cleared to initiate its Phase 2a clinical study evaluating CC-31244 for the treatment of HCV infected individuals.
 
In June 2018, the Company began enrollment in and initiation of patient dosing in its Phase 2a clinical study evaluating CC-31244 for the treatment of HCV infected individuals and completed the enrollment in September 2018. The Phase 2a open-label study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of CC-31244 in combination with Epclusa, an approved HCV drug. Patients are treated with CC-31244 and Epclusa for two weeks and then Epclusa alone for an additional four weeks.
 
On January 22, 2019 the Company announced safety and preliminary efficacy data for the Phase 2a study. All subjects had completed the six-week treatment regimen. The treatment was well tolerated with no study discontinuations due to adverse events. Eight of 12 subjects achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after completion of treatment (SVR12). SVR12 is defined as undetectable virus in blood 12 weeks after completion of treatment and is considered a virologic cure. The trial is ongoing at the Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine and final study results are expected in the second quarter of 2019.
 
In addition, in October 2018, the Company signed a Clinical Trial Agreement for an investigator-initiated study with the Humanity & Health Research Centre in Hong Kong, China. Under the Clinical Trial Agreement, the Phase 2a study of CC-31244 for the treatment of HCV, which is expected to commence during the first half of 2019, will be sponsored and conducted by the Humanity & Health Research Centre in Hong Kong under the guidance of Dr. George Lau, MBBS (HKU), M.D. (HKU), FRCP (Edin, Lond), FHKAM (Med), FHKCP, FAASLD, Chairman of Humanity and Health Medical Centre, Hong Kong. The Company has agreed to provide CC-31244 to be used in the Phase 2a study.

In December 2018, the Company voluntarily terminated a license agreement with Emory University covering the patents and patent applications for HCV inhibitors, which are not essential to our HCV program. See “Item I - Business – Collaborations – Emory University Collaboration” for further information.
 
The Company is in partnership discussions for further clinical development of CC-31244.
 
Influenza
 
We have several preclinical candidates under development for the treatment of influenza infection. CC-42344, a novel PB2 inhibitor, has been selected as a preclinical lead. This candidate binds to a highly conserved PB2 site of influenza polymerase complex (PB1: PB2: PA) and exhibits a novel mechanism of action. CC-42344 showed excellent antiviral activity against influenza A strains, including avian pandemic strains and Tamiflu resistant strains, and has favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. We are currently conducting additional preclinical IND enabling studies and plan to initiate a Phase 1 study during 2020.
 
In addition, novel inhibitors effective against both strains A and B have been identified and are in the preclinical stage. Several of these have potencies approaching single digit nanomolar. On January 2, 2019, the Company entered into an Exclusive License and Research Collaboration Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (“Merck”) to discover and develop certain proprietary influenza A/B antiviral agents. See “Item 1 – Business – Collaborations – Merck Collaboration” for more information.
 
Norovirus Infections
 
We continue to identify and develop non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors using the Company’s proprietary structure-based drug design technology platform.
 
Therapeutic Targets
 
Hepatitis C: A large competitive market with opportunity for shorter treatment regimens.
 
HCV is a highly competitive and changing market. Currently, the standard treatment varies with the genotype of the HCV infection. Prior to late 2013, treatment included peginterferon alpha and ribavirin, along with a protease inhibitor (either telaprevir, boceprevir, or simeprevir). In late 2013, sofosbuvir, a drug belonging to a new class of drugs called “nucleoside analogs” or “Nucs,” was approved to treat HCV. In patients infected with HCV genotype 1 (the most common HCV genotype in the US), sofosbuvir was administered in combination with peginterferon alpha and ribavirin. In patients with HCV genotypes 2 and 3, however, sofosbuvir could be effectively administered in combination with ribavirin, without the need for peginterferon alpha. Since 2014, several new combinations of direct-acting antiviral agents (“DAAs”) have been approved for the treatment of HCV infection. These include Harvoni (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir) 12 weeks of treatment, Viekira Pak (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir) 12 weeks of treatment, Epclusa (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) 12 weeks of treatment, Zepatier (elbasvir/grazoprevir) 12 weeks of treatment and Mavyret (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) 8 weeks of treatment. We believe the next improvements in HCV treatment will be ultra-short treatments of four to six weeks, the goal of our program.
 
We anticipate a significant global HCV market opportunity that will persist through at least 2036, given the large prevalence of HCV infection worldwide. The 2017 World Health Organization Global Hepatitis Report estimates that 71 million people worldwide have chronic HCV infections.
 
We are targeting the NS5B polymerase with an NNI, which could be developed as part of an all-oral, pan-genotypic combination regimen. Our focus is on developing what is now called ultrashort treatment regimens from 4 to 6 weeks in length. Such a combination treatment CC-31244 with different classes of approved DAAs has the potential to change the paradigm of treatment for HCV with a shorter duration of treatment. Combination strategies with approved drugs could allow us to expand CC-31244 into the HCV antiviral therapeutic area globally and could lead to a high and fast cure rate, to improved compliance, and to reduced treatment duration. To our knowledge no competing company has yet developed a short HCV treatment of less than 8 weeks with a high (>95%) sustained virologic response (SVR) at week 12.

CC-31244, an HCV NNI, is a potential best in class pan-genotypic inhibitor of NS5B polymerase for the treatment of HCV. The Company completed a Phase 1a/b study in Canada in September 2016, with favorable safety results in a randomized, double-blinded, Phase 1a/b study in healthy volunteers and HCV-infected subjects. The Company is presently conducting a Phase 2a study in HCV genotype 1 subjects in the United States. Cocrystal presented the interim results from the Phase1a/b study at the APASL in February 2017. HCV-infected subjects treated with CC-31244 had a rapid and marked decline in HCV RNA levels, and slow viral rebound after treatment. Results of this study suggest that CC-31244 could be an important component in a shortened duration all-oral HCV combination therapy. Patient enrollment has been completed in the Phase 2b. See “Item 1 – Business – Research and Development Update – Hepatitis C” for more information.
 
The Company is progressing clinically while seeking a partner for further clinical development of CC-31244.
 
Influenza: A worldwide public health problem, including the potential for pandemic disease.
 
Influenza is a severe respiratory illness, caused primarily by influenza A or B virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”) estimates that influenza was linked to approximately 79,000 deaths and 960,000 hospitalizations in the United States during the 2017-2018 flu season. According to the report published by BCC Research in May 2018, the worldwide market for antiviral drugs to treat influenza was valued at approximately $5.6 billion in 2017 and is expected to grow to $6.5 billion by 2022.
 
Currently, approved antiviral treatments for influenza are effective, but burdened with significant viral resistance. Strains of influenza virus that are resistant to the approved treatments osteltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu(R)) and zanamavir (Relenza(R)) have appeared, and in some cases predominate. For example, the predominant strain of the 2009 swine influenza pandemic was resistant to Tamiflu. These drugs target viral neuraminidase enzymes, which are not highly conserved between viral strains. In fact, different influenza virus strains such as H1N1 and H5N1 are named according to their respective differences in hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N).
 
In addition, the Company has several preclinical candidates under development for the treatment of influenza infection. CC-42344, a novel PB2 inhibitor, has been selected as a preclinical lead. This candidate binds to a highly conserved PB2 site of the influenza polymerase complex (PB1: PB2: PA), and exhibits a novel mechanism of action. CC-42344 showed excellent antiviral activity against influenza A strains, including avian pandemic strains and Tamiflu-resistant strains, and has favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Antiviral product candidates that are competitors for the Company’s influenza programs are, VX-787, being developed by Janssen, and S-033188, being developed by Shionogi/Roche. S-033188 was approved as Xofluza in Japan on February 23, 2018, and in US as Baloxavir Marboxil (trade name Xofluza®) on October 24, 2018. See “Item 1 – Business – Research and Development Update – Influenza” for more information.
 
Norovirus: A worldwide public health problem responsible for close to 90% of epidemic, non-bacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis around the world.
 
Norovirus is a very common and highly contagious virus that causes symptoms of acute gastroenteritis including nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and diarrhea. Other symptoms include fatigue, fever and dehydration. Noroviruses are a major cause of gastrointestinal illness in closed and crowded environments, having become notorious for their common occurrence in hospitals, nursing homes, child care facilities, and cruise ships. In the United States alone, noroviruses are the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis, and are estimated to cause 20 million illnesses each year and contribute to 70,000 hospitalizations and 800 deaths. Noroviruses are responsible for up to 1.1 million hospitalizations and 218,000 deaths annually in children in the developing world. In immunosuppressed patients, chronic norovirus infection can lead to a debilitating illness with extended periods of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. There is currently no effective treatment or effective vaccine for norovirus, and the ability to curtail outbreaks is limited. A few companies, including Chimerix, are developing antiviral treatments for this disease and three candidate vaccines are currently in early stages of clinical testing by GlaxoSmithKline, Ligocyte and Takeda Pharmaceuticals.

By targeting viral replication enzymes, we believe it is possible to develop an effective treatment for all genogroups of norovirus. Also, because of the significant unmet medical need and the possibility of chronic norovirus infection in immunocompromised individuals, new antiviral therapeutic approaches may warrant an accelerated path to market. The Company is developing inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of norovirus. Similar to the HCV polymerases, this enzyme is essential to viral replication and is highly conserved between all noroviral genogroups. Therefore, an inhibitor of this enzyme might be an effective treatment or short-term prophylactic agent, when administered during a cruise or nursing home stay, for example. We have developed X-ray quality norovirus polymerase crystals, and have identified promising NNIs. We are implementing the platform and approaches that have proven successful in our other antiviral programs.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our core technology. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights.
 
Our patent portfolio consisted of patents and pending applications in the areas primarily related to the treatment of HCV, Influenza A, and Influenza B.
 
In our NS5B NNI program, our patent portfolio consists of three related families, including two granted U.S. patents and two pending U.S. patent applications. Counterpart applications in one family are filed in various countries and regions around the world.
 
In our influenza A program, our patent portfolio consists of two related families, including three pending U.S. provisional applications and pending applications in Patent Cooperation Treaty countries and Taiwan. In our influenza A/B program two pending U.S. provisional applications have been filed.
 
In our NS3 program for HepC, we have one issued U.S. patent, an allowed European application, and three pending foreign applications in Canada, China, and Japan.
 
Collaborations
 
Merck Collaboration
 
On January 2, 2019, we entered into an Exclusive License and Research Collaboration Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Merck to discover and develop certain proprietary influenza A/B antiviral agents.
 
Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Merck is funding research and development for the program at Cocrystal and Merck, including clinical development at Merck, and Merck is responsible for worldwide commercialization of any products derived from the collaboration. The Company received an upfront payment of $4,000,000 and is eligible to receive milestone payments related to designated development, regulatory and sales milestones with the potential to earn up to $156,000,000, as well as royalties on product sales.
 
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - If our research collaboration with Merck is terminated or is otherwise unsuccessful, including failure to reach milestones, we could lose the research program funding, and would not receive milestone payments or royalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, our ability to successfully develop and commercialize influenza A/B product candidates and our future financial condition” for the discussion of termination provisions of the Collaboration Agreement.
 
Emory University Collaboration
 
On December 6, 2018, we notified Emory University (“Emory”) of the termination of our License Agreement with Emory, dated March 7, 2013 (the “License Agreement”). The License Agreement covered patents and patent applications for HCV inhibitors, which we no longer consider essential to our HCV program. As part of our HCV program, we continue to focus our efforts on CC-31244, our HCV NNI. See “Item 1 – Business ‒ Research and Development Update ‒ Hepatitis C.” The Company had the right to terminate the License Agreement at its sole discretion upon 90 days’ prior written notice and upon payment of all amounts due Emory under the License Agreement through the date of termination. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the License Agreement has been terminated, no amounts were due under the License Agreement and none will be owed in the future.

National Institute of Health
 
Cocrystal has two Public Health Biological Materials License Agreements with the National Institute of Health. The original license agreements were dated August 31, 2010 and amended on November 6, 2013. The materials licensed are being used in Norovirus assays to screen potential antiviral agents in our library.
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to intense and rapidly changing competition as companies seek to develop new technologies and proprietary products. We know of several companies that have marketed or are developing products for the treatment of HCV or influenza, including Gilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead”), Merck & Co., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Toyama Chemical Co., Shionogi/Roche and Abbvie, Inc. In particular, Gilead and Abbvie dominate the market for HCV with an estimated combined market share greater than 85%. Their products are widely considered effective. Many of the companies developing products for the other viral diseases that are of interest to us have substantially greater financial resources, expertise and capabilities than we do.
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of drug products. Any product candidates we develop must be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) before they may be legally marketed in the U.S., and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agencies before they may be legally marketed in other countries. The clinical testing of product candidates to establish their safety and efficacy in humans is subject to substantial statutory and regulatory requirements with which we must comply.
Employees
 
As of April 1, 2019, we employed 10 full-time employees. Of these full-time employees, eight are engaged in research and development activities. In addition, we have contracts with Clinical Research Organizations (“CROs”), Contract Manufacturing Organizations (“CMOs”) and consultants to provide chemistry, toxicology, preclinical, clinical, regulatory work on our programs.
Corporate History
 
The Company was formerly incorporated in Nevada under the name Biozone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Biozone”). On January 2, 2014, Biozone sold substantially all of its assets to MusclePharm Corporation, and, on the same day, merged with Cocrystal Discovery, Inc. (“Discovery”) in a transaction accounted for as a reverse merger. Following the merger, the Company assumed Discovery’s business plan and operations. On March 18, 2014, the Company reincorporated in Delaware under the name Cocrystal Pharma, Inc.
 
On November 25, 2014, a subsidiary of the Company and affiliated entities completed a series of merger transactions. As a result, a subsidiary of the Company merged with RFS Pharma, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company (RFS Pharma”).
