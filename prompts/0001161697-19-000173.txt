ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

Neutra Corp. was incorporated in Nevada on January 11, 2011 to market and participate in the nutraceutical space by bringing products derived from all natural and organic origins. Along with participating in the actual nutraceutical products, we plan to research and bring new technology to the nutraceutical space. Nutraceutical natural medicine is an alternative system that focuses on natural remedies and the body’s vital ability to heal and maintain itself. One of the nutraceutical sub-markets is the new thriving medical cannabis market, in which we intend to participate. We intend to entrust the manufacturing to a nutraceutical contractor to private label all of our products and to sell them under our unique brand. We have established a fiscal year end of January 31.

As the global cannabis market grows exponentially, it is constantly in need of better technologies and products to be more efficient in how it grows, what it grows and how it consumes cannabis and its related products. From lighting to dosage devices, from pesticide replacements to plant enhancers, Neutra Corp. is constantly combing the industry for the latest and greatest to test, prove and bring to market.

On January 23, 2018, we entered into an agreement with Artillery Labs to sell and market natural nutraceuticals online. The objective of this agreement is for the Company to have its own line of all natural and legal CBD products for sale through Artillery Labs’ online sales infrastructure. Under the terms of the agreement, Artillery Labs will be paid $25,000 upon the successful marketing launch of a product.

We have generated limited revenues to date and our activities have been primarily limited to developing our business plan and research and development of products. We will not have the necessary capital to fully develop or execute our business plan until we are able to secure additional financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available on suitable terms. We need to raise additional funds in order to implement our business plan. Our current cash on hand is insufficient to commercialize our products or fully develop our business strategy. If we are unable to raise adequate additional funds or if those funds are not available on terms that are acceptable to us, we will not be able to execute our business plan and we may cease operations.
