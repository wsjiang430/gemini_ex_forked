The Company’s restaurant operations are conducted through two subsidiaries: Steak n Shake Inc. (“Steak n Shake”) and Western Sizzlin Corporation (“Western Sizzlin”) for a combined 545 units. As of December 31, 2022, Steak n Shake had 177 company-operated restaurants, 175 franchise partner units, and 154 traditional franchise units.

The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”), declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, caused governments to impose restrictive measures to contain its spread. In response to COVID-19, our restaurants were required to close their dining rooms in the first quarter of 2020, and the majority of those dining rooms remained closed during 2020. Steak n Shake reopened the majority of dining rooms during 2021, and in doing so has implemented a self-service model. Our restaurant operations followed the guidance of health officials in determining the appropriate restrictions to put in place for each restaurant. 
Company-Operated Restaurants
A typical company-operated restaurant management team consists of a general manager, a restaurant manager, and other managers, depending on the sales volume of the restaurant. Each restaurant’s general manager has primary responsibility for the day-to-day operations of his or her unit. Restaurant operations obtain food products and supplies from independent national distributors. Purchases are centrally negotiated to ensure uniformity in product quality.
Franchise Partner Restaurants
Steak n Shake offers a franchise partner program to transition company-operated restaurants to franchise partnerships. The franchise agreement stipulates that the franchisee make an upfront investment totaling ten thousand dollars. Steak n Shake, as the franchisor, assesses a fee of up to 15% of sales as well as 50% of profits. Potential franchise partners are screened based on entrepreneurial attitude and ability, but they become franchise partners based on achievement. Each must meet the gold standard in service. Franchise partners are single-unit owner-operators.
Traditional Franchise Restaurants
Restaurant operations’ traditional franchising program extends the brands to areas in which there are no current development plans for company stores. The expansion plans include seeking qualified new franchisees and expanding relationships with current franchisees. Restaurant operations typically seek franchisees with both the financial resources necessary to fund successful development and significant experience in the restaurant/retail business. Both restaurant chains assist franchisees with the development and ongoing operation of their restaurants. In addition, personnel assist franchisees with site selection, approve restaurant sites, and provide prototype plans, construction support, and specifications. Restaurant operations staff provides both on-site and off-site instruction to franchise restaurant management and associates. 
International
We have a corporate office in Monaco and an international organization with personnel in various functions to support our international business. Similar to our traditional domestic franchise agreements, a typical international franchise development agreement includes development and franchise fees in addition to subsequent royalty fees based on the gross sales of each restaurant. 
Competition
The restaurant business is one of the most intensely competitive industries. As there are virtually no barriers to entry into the restaurant business, competitors may include national, regional, and local establishments. Restaurant businesses compete on the basis of price, convenience, service, experience, menu variety, and product quality. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national, regional, and local economic conditions. The performance of individual restaurants may be impacted by factors such as traffic patterns, demographic trends, weather conditions, and competing restaurants.
Government Regulations
The Company is subject to various global, federal, state, and local laws affecting its restaurant operations. Each of the restaurants must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, i.e., health, sanitation, safety, and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. 
Various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees, e.g., minimum wage, overtime pay, unemployment tax, health insurance, and workers’ compensation. Federal, state, and local government agencies have established regulations requiring that we disclose nutritional information. 
Trademark and Licenses
The name and reputation of Steak n Shake is a material asset, and management protects it and other service marks through appropriate registrations.
Insurance Business
Biglari Holdings’ insurance activities are conducted through two insurance entities, First Guard Insurance Company and its affiliated agency, 1st Guard Corporation (collectively “First Guard”), and Southern Pioneer Property & Casualty Insurance Company and its affiliated agency, Southern Pioneer Insurance Agency, Inc. (collectively “Southern Pioneer”). Our insurance businesses provide insurance of property and casualty. 
The insurance business is stringently regulated by state insurance departments. Insurers based in the United States are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. First Guard and Southern Pioneer operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities. The primary focus of regulation is to ensure that insurers are financially solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital levels for insurance companies and establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States have the authority to suspend or revoke a company’s authority to do business as conditions warrant. States regulate the payment of dividends by insurance companies to their shareholders and other transactions with affiliates. Dividends, capital distributions, and other transactions of extraordinary amounts are subject to prior regulatory approval. Insurers may market, sell, and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers are referred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium rates. Except for regulatory considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance industry. 
First Guard is a direct underwriter of commercial truck insurance, selling physical damage and nontrucking liability insurance to truckers. The commercial truck insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. Vigorous competition is provided by large, well-capitalized companies and by small regional insurers. First Guard’s insurance products are marketed primarily through direct response methods via the Internet or by telephone. First Guard’s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods enable it to be a low-cost insurer. First Guard uses its own claim staff to manage claims. Seasonal variations in First Guard’s insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of claims. First Guard is headquartered in Venice, Florida. 
Southern Pioneer underwrites garage liability and commercial property as well as homeowners and dwelling fire insurance on an admitted basis. Insurance coverages are offered nationwide, primarily through insurance agents. Southern Pioneer competes with large companies and local insurers. Southern Pioneer is headquartered in Jonesboro, Arkansas.
Biglari Holdings’ insurance operations may be affected by extraordinary weather conditions or other factors, any of which may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of claims.
Oil and Gas Business
The Company's oil and gas operations are conducted through two entities, Southern Oil Company (“Southern Oil”) and Abraxas Petroleum Corporation (“Abraxas Petroleum”). Southern Oil primarily operates oil and natural gas properties offshore in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Abraxas Petroleum operates oil and natural gas wells in the Permian Basin.
On September 14, 2022, the Company purchased Series A Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Shares”) of Abraxas Petroleum for a purchase price of $80 million. On October 26, 2022, the Company exchanged the Preferred Shares for 90% of the outstanding common stock of Abraxas Petroleum. 
The oil and gas industry is fundamentally a commodity business. Southern Oil’s and Abraxas Petroleum’s operations and earnings, therefore, may be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices. The COVID-19 pandemic caused oil demand to decrease significantly during the second and third quarters of 2020, which created oversupplied markets and lower commodity prices and margins. In response, the Company cut production and expenses in its oil and natural gas business during 2020. However, the significant increase in average crude oil and natural gas prices in 2021 and 2022 as compared to 2020 resulting from the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the resumption of normal economic activity, and the resulting improvement in supply and demand fundamentals caused Southern Oil to return to full production during 2021 and 2022. Biglari Holdings’ oil and gas operations compete with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies. In addition, our companies are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the oil and gas business, including a wide range of local, state, and federal regulations.
Southern Oil is headquartered in Madisonville, Louisiana, and Abraxas Petroleum is headquartered in San Antonio, Texas.
Brand Licensing Business
Maxim’s business lies principally in brand licensing. Maxim is headquartered in New York, New York.
Maxim competes for licensing business with other companies. The nature of the licensing business is predicated on projects that materialize with irregularity. In addition, publishing is a highly competitive business. 
Maxim products are marketed under various registered brand names, including, but not limited to, “MAXIM®” and “Maxim®.”
Investments
The Company and its subsidiaries have invested in The Lion Fund, L.P., and The Lion Fund II, L.P. (collectively, “the investment partnerships”). The investment partnerships operate as private investment funds. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the investments was $383.0 million. These investments are subject to a rolling five-year lock-up period under the terms of the respective partnership agreements.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed 2,559 persons. When hiring personnel, we do not consider circumstances of birth, race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or any other factor unrelated to talent. The factor of prime importance to us, talent, is invariably found across a wide spectrum of humanity. We seek to associate with people of high character and competence.
