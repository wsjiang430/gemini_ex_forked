 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
  
 As used in this Annual Report, “we,” “us,” “our,” “True Drinks,” “Company” or “our Company” refers to True Drinks Holdings, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. We are a holding company and conduct no operating business, except through our subsidiaries.
 CERTAIN DISCUSSIONS WHICH FOLLOW REGARDING THE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS REFER TO THE OPERATING BUSINESS PRIOR TO THE END OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, AND DO NOT REFLECT THE OPERATING BUSINESS SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD.
  
  Overview
  
 True Drinks Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Nevada in January 2001 and is the holding company for True Drinks, Inc. (“True Drinks”), a company incorporated in the state of Delaware in January 2012 that specialized in all-natural, vitamin-enhanced drinks. Previously, our primary business was the development, marketing, sale and distribution of AquaBall® Naturally Flavored Water. We previously distributed AquaBall® nationally through select retail channels, such as grocery stores, mass merchandisers, drug stores and online. Although, as noted below, we have discontinued the production, distribution and sale of AquaBall®, we continue to market and distribute Bazi® All Natural Energy, a liquid nutritional supplement drink, which is currently distributed online and through our existing database of customers.
  
 Our principal place of business is 2 Park Plaza, Suite 1200, Irvine, California 92614. Our telephone number is (949) 203-3500. Our corporate website address is http://www.truedrinks.com. Our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), is currently listed for quotation on the OTC Pink Marketplace under the symbol “TRUU.”
   
  Cessation of Production of AquaBall®, and Management’s Plan
  
 During the first quarter of 2018, due to the weakness in the sale of the Company’s principal product, AquaBall® Naturally Flavored Water, and continued substantial operating losses, the Company’s Board of Directors determined to discontinue the production of AquaBall®, and, as set forth below, terminate the bottling agreement by and between Niagara Bottling LLC, the Company’s contract bottling manufacturer (“Bottler” or “Niagara”), and True Drinks (the “Bottling Agreement”). In addition, the Company notified Disney Consumer Products, Inc. (“Disney”) of the Company’s desire to terminate its licensing agreement with Disney (“Disney License”), pursuant to which the Company was able to feature various Disney characters on each AquaBall® bottle. As a result of management’s decision, and the Company’s failure to pay certain amounts due Disney under the terms of the Disney License, the Disney License terminated, and Disney claimed amounts due of approximately $178,000, net of $378,000 drawn from an irrevocable letter of credit posted in connection with the execution of the Disney License. In addition, Disney sought additional payments for minimum royalty amounts required to be paid Disney through the remainder of the term of the Disney License. On July 17, 2018 the Company and Disney entered into a settlement and release whereby in exchange for a payment to Disney of $42,000, the parties agreed to release each other from any and all claims related to the Disney License.
  
 In April 2018, the Company sold its remaining AquaBall® inventory to Red Beard for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.44 million (the “Purchase Price”). As payment for the Purchase Price, the principal amount of the senior secured convertible promissory note issued to Red Beard by the Company in the principal amount of $2.25 million (the “Red Beard Note”) was reduced by the Purchase Price, resulting in approximately $814,000 owed to Red Beard under the terms of the Red Beard Note as of April 5, 2018. Management is currently negotiating with Red Beard to convert the remaining amounts due under the terms of the Red Beard Note into shares of the Company’s Common Stock.
    
 The Company has reduced its staff to one employee, and has contracted with former management and other professionals to continue operations. In addition, the Company has taken other steps to minimize general, administrative and other operating costs, while maintaining only those costs and expenses necessary to maintain sales of Bazi® and otherwise continue operations while the Board of Directors and the Company’s principal stockholder explore opportunities, as more particularly described below. Management has also worked to reduce accounts payable by negotiating settlements with creditors, including Disney, utilizing advances from Red Beard aggregating approximately $505,000 since September 30, 2018, and is currently negotiating with its remaining creditors to settle additional accounts payable.
  
 Management is currently exploring, together with its largest shareholder, available options to maximize the value of AquaBall® as well as the value of its continued operations consisting of the marketing and sale of Bazi®. In addition, although no assurances can be given, management is actively exploring and negotiating, together with its largest shareholder, opportunities to engage in one or more strategic or other transactions that would maximize the value of the Company as a fully reporting operating public company with a focus on developing consumer brands, as well as restructuring its preferred capital and indebtedness in order to position the Company as an attractive candidate for such transactions.

  Termination of Bottling Agreement and Issuance of Notes
  
 On April 5, 2018 (the “Effective Date”), True Drinks settled all amounts due the Bottler under the terms of the Bottling Agreement (the “Settlement”). As of the Effective Date, the damage amount claimed by the Bottler under the Bottling Agreement was $18,480,620, which amount consisted of amounts due to the Bottler for product as well as amounts due for True Drink’s failure to meet certain minimum requirements under the Bottling Agreement (the “Outstanding Amount”). Concurrently, an affiliate of Red Beard and the Bottler agreed to terminate a personal guaranty of Red Beard’s obligations under the Bottling Agreement in an amount not to exceed $10.0 million (the “Affiliate Guaranty”) (the Bottling Agreement and the Affiliate Guaranty are hereinafter referred to as the “2015 Agreements”).
  
 Under the terms of the Settlement, in exchange for the termination of the 2015 Agreements, the Bottler agreed to accept, among other things: (i) a promissory note in the principal amount of $4,644,906 (the “Principal Amount”), with a 5% per annum interest rate, to be compounded, annually (“Note One”), (ii) a promissory note with a principal amount equal to the Outstanding Amount (“Note Two”), and (iii) a cash payment of $2,185,158 (the “Cash Payment”).
  
 The Principal Amount and all interest payments due under Note One shall be due and payable to the Bottler in full on or before the December 31, 2019 (the “Note Payment”). On January 14, 2019, the Company, True Drinks and Red Beard entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, pursuant to which the Company and True Drinks assigned, and Red Beard assumed, all outstanding rights and obligations of the Company and True Drinks under the terms of Note One. As a result, all obligations of the Company and True Drinks under Note One, including for the payment of amounts due thereunder, were assigned to Red Beard.
  
 Note Two shall have no force or effect except under certain conditions and shall be reduced by any payments made to the Bottler under the terms of the Settlement. True Drinks and the Company shall be jointly and severally responsible for all amounts due, if any, under Note Two, which shall automatically expire and terminate on December 31, 2019.
  
 In consideration for the guarantee of the Company’s obligations in connection with the Settlement, including as a joint and several obligor under the terms of Note One, the Company agreed to issue Red Beard 348,367,950 shares of the Company’s Common Stock (the “Shares”), which Shares were to be issued at such time as the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 300.0 million to at least 2.0 billion (the “Amendment”), but in no event later than September 30, 2018. As a condition to the Company’s obligation to issue the Shares, Red Beard executed, and caused its affiliates to execute, a written consent of shareholders to approve the Amendment. As discussed below, on November 15, 2018, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock to 7.0 billion, thereby triggering the Company’s obligation to issue the Shares to Red Beard.
  
 In connection with the Settlement, and in order to make the Cash Payment described above, the Company issued the Red Beard Note to Red Beard, which Red Beard Note accrues interest at a rate of 5% per annum. In May 2018, as a result of the sale to Red Beard of the Company’s remaining AquaBall® inventory, the principal amount of the Red Beard Note was reduced by the Purchase Price.
  
 Pursuant to the terms of the Red Beard Note, Red Beard shall have the right, at its sole option, to convert the outstanding balance due into that number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company’s Common Stock equal to the outstanding balance divided by $0.005 (the “Conversion Option”); provided, however, that the Company shall have the right, at its sole option, to pay all or a portion of the accrued and unpaid interest due and payable to Red Beard upon its exercise of the Conversion Option in cash. Pursuant to the terms of the Red Beard Note, such Conversion Option shall not be exercisable unless and until such time as the Company has filed the Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State, which occurred on November 15, 2018. As a result of the Increase in Authorized, Red Beard may now exercise its Conversion Option under the Red Beard Note at any time.
   
 All outstanding principal and interest due under the terms of the Red Beard Note shall be due and payable to Red Beard in full on or before December 31, 2019 and is secured by a continuing security interest in substantially all of the Company’s assets. Management is currently negotiating with Red Beard to exercise the Conversion Option, resulting in the conversion of all amounts due under the terms of the Red Beard Note into shares of the Company’s Common Stock.
 
Food Labs Promissory Note 
 On September 18, 2018, the Company and Food Labs, Inc. (“Food Labs”) entered into an agreement, pursuant to which the Company sold and issued to Food Labs a promissory note in the principal amount of $50,000 (the “Food Labs Note”). The Food Labs Note (i) accrues interest at a rate of 5% per annum, (ii) includes an additional lender’s fee equal to $500, or 1% of the principal amount, and (iii) matures on December 31, 2019. Food Labs is controlled by Red Beard. The Company currently intends to borrow additional amounts from Red Beard, as more particularly set forth under “Red Beard Line-of-Credit” below, to pay Food Labs all amounts due Food Labs under the terms of the Food Labs Note.

  Increase in Authorized Shares of Common Stock
  
 On November 15, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to increase the total number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance thereunder from 300.0 million to 7.0 billion shares (the “Increase in Authorized”).
  
 As a result of the Increase in Authorized, Red Beard may now exercise its Conversion Option under the Red Beard Note at any time and, while no assurances can be given, management believes that the Conversion Option will be exercised by Red Beard resulting in the conversion of all amounts due Red Beard by the Company under the terms of the Red Beard Note being converted into shares of Common Stock.
  
  Red Beard Line-of-Credit
  
 On November 19, 2018, the Company entered into a line-of-credit with Red Beard, effective October 25, 2018, pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to $250,000 (the “Red Beard LOC”); provided, however, that Red Beard may, in its sole discretion, decline to provide additional advances under the Red Beard LOC upon written notice the Company of its intent to decline to make such advances. Interest shall accrue on the outstanding principal of amount of the Red Beard LOC at a rate of 8% per annum; provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, as defined in the Red Beard LOC, the accrual of interest shall increase to a rate of 10% per annum. Prior to December 31, 2019 (the “Maturity Date”), Red Beard has the right, at its sole option, to convert the outstanding principal balance, plus all accrued but unpaid interest due under the Red Beard LOC (the “Outstanding Balance”) into that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Outstanding Balance divided by $0.005. As of March 29, 2019, the Company has borrowed a total of $505,000 under the Red Beard LOC, and intends to borrow additional amounts from Red Beard under the Red Beard LOC equal to the principal and accrued interest due under the terms of the Food Labs Note, totaling approximately $51,227 as of December 31, 2018, therefore terminating the Food Labs Note. While no assurances can be given, management is currently negotiating with Red Beard to convert all amounts due Red Beard under the terms of the Red Beard LOC into shares of the Company’s Common Stock.
 Note Extensions
  
 On January 28, 2019, the Company entered into agreements with the holders of three Senior Secured Promissory Notes (the “Notes”) to extend the maturity date of each of the Notes by 60 days (the “Extension Agreements”). The Notes were each issued between July 25, 2017 to July 31, 2017, originally matured six months after issuance, have an aggregate principal balance of $750,000, and accrue interest at a rate of 8% per annum. As a result of the Extension Agreements, the Notes matured on March 26, 2019, March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2019, respectively. The Company is currently in negotiations with the noteholders for possible further extensions or conversion of the balance due under the notes into equity of the Company.
 Our Products
  
 As of December 31, 2018, as a result of our determination to cease production of our AquaBall® product in the first quarter of 2018, we marketed and distributed one product, Bazi® All Natural Energy.
  Bazi®
  
 Bazi® All Natural Energy, is a liquid nutritional drink packed with eight different super fruits, including the Chinese jujube and seven other super fruits, plus 12 vitamins. The proprietary formula contains the following fruits: jujube fruit, blueberry, pomegranate, goji berry, chokeberry, raspberry, acai and sea buckthorn. Additionally, Bazi® contains 12 vitamins, including vitamins A, C, E and B-complex. In August 2011, BioEnergy Ribose was added to Bazi®, enhancing the product’s energy delivery system. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Bazi® sales accounted for 9% of the Company’s total revenue. Due to the ceased production of AquaBall® in early 2018, the Company currently anticipates that Bazi® sales will account for substantially all of the Company’s revenue in the near future.
 Manufacturing and Distribution
  
  Manufacturing
  
 Prior to the cessation of the production of AquaBall® in early 2018, Niagara was responsible for all production of AquaBall® pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Bottling Agreement. Niagara handled all aspects of production, including the procurement of all raw materials necessary to produce AquaBall®. In accordance with the terms of the Bottling Agreement, Niagara provided us with finished goods and billed us for product as it was shipped to customers. In addition to Niagara, we worked with a limited number of partners to repack bottles of AquaBall® into six-packs and our 15-pack club packages. As disclosed under the heading “Recent Developments” above, on April 5, 2018, we entered into the Settlement with Niagara, pursuant to which the Bottling Agreement was terminated. The decision to terminate the Bottling Agreement reflected management’s determination that we could not produce AquaBall® profitably under the Bottling Agreement.
  
  Bazi® has been, and continues to be, manufactured by Arizona Packaging and Production since 2007.

  Retail Distribution
  
 Prior to ceasing production of AquaBall® in early 2018, we focused our retail distribution strategy towards a nationwide network of regional distributors for each of our grocery, drug and convenience accounts. Throughout 2017 and early 2018, we signed with distributor partners in 47 states. We also greatly increased our sales organization to manage the distributor network. Upon implementing this strategy in 2015, we experienced the expected sales increase in singles, but we found that our resulting pricing on multi-packs was too high and, thus, their sales lagged in many regions of the country. At the same time, our discounts and allowances increased considerably as did our labor costs. These conditions contributed to our decision to discontinue production of AquaBall® in early 2018.
 Online Sales
  
 Our e-commerce platform allowed consumers to purchase AquaBall® Naturally Flavored Water through Amazon.com, and still allows current and future consumers to purchase Bazi® Energy Shot through http://www.drinkbazi.com. All sales of Bazi® Energy Shot are made through our online platform. Prior to discontinuing the production of AquaBall®, we drove traffic to relevant landing pages and micro sites through digital marketing campaigns and promotions, as well as a variety of social media marketing efforts.
 Sales and Marketing
  
 Prior to ceasing production of AquaBall®, our sales and marketing efforts were directed from our corporate offices in Irvine, California, utilizing our own staff, as well as outside resources retained to build market awareness and shelf placement of our products. We managed key national accounts through our in-house national sales team. Due to pricing issues caused by the distributor mark-up, our multi-pack AquaBall® sales did not meet expectations. In addition, most distributors failed to meet sales volumes necessary to make the relationships profitable. This contributed to our determination to discontinue the production of AquaBall® and significantly reduce our personnel in early 2018.
  
 While Bazi is sold online at  http://www.drinkbazi.com, a large portion of its sales are made to recurring customers on a subscription basis.
  
  Source and Availability of Raw Materials
  
 Beginning in May 2016 and until the cessation of production of AquaBall® in early 2018, Niagara handled all aspects of production of AquaBall®, including the procurement of all raw materials.
  
 During 2018, we relied significantly on one supplier for 100% of our purchases of certain raw materials for Bazi®. Bazi, Inc. has sourced these raw materials from this supplier since 2007, and does not anticipate any issues with the supply of these raw materials.
  
 We own the formulas for both AquaBall® Naturally Flavored Water and Bazi® All Natural Energy, and we believe that our purchasing requirements can be readily met from alternative sources, if necessary.
  
  Competition
 
 The industry in which we operate is highly competitive.
    
 Prior to the cessation of production, AquaBall® Naturally Flavored Water competed most directly with other beverages marketed directly to children. We also competed with other manufacturers of functional beverages, and with manufacturers of more traditional beverages, such as juice and soda. Our primary competition for AquaBall® was in the estimated $2.0 billion market for products marketed directly to children, including CapriSun®, Honest Kids, Good to Grow, Tummy Ticklers, Kool-aid and others.
  
 Bazi® competitors include Steaz®, Guayaki Yerba Mate, POM Wonderful®, as well as sports and energy drinks including Gatorade®, Red Bull®, 5-Hour Energy®, RockStar®, Monster®, Powerade®, Accelerade® and All Sport®. These competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. They, therefore, have the advantage of established reputations, brand names, track records, back office and managerial support systems and other advantages that we cannot duplicate in the near future, if ever. Moreover, many competitors, by virtue of their longevity and capital resources, have established lines of distribution to which we do not have access, and are not likely to duplicate in the near term, if ever.

  Intellectual Property
  
  Patents and Trademarks
  
 We were granted a patent for AquaBall®’s stackable, spherical drink container in 2009, via GT Beverage Company, LLC, who we purchased on March 31, 2012. In 2016, we stopped using this bottle and, instead, switched to a bottle specifically designed for us by Niagara. In 2017, we took an impairment charge on the value of the spherical drink container patent.
  
 We maintain trademark protection for AquaBall® and have federal trademark registration for Bazi®. This trademark registration is protected for a period of ten years from the grant date, and then is renewable thereafter if still in use.
  
  Licensing Agreement
  
  We previously had a licensing agreement with Disney (the “Disney License”), which allowed us to feature popular Disney characters on AquaBall® Naturally Flavored Water, allowing AquaBall® to stand out among other beverages marketed towards children. As discussed in the section entitled “Recent Developments” above, in connection with the discontinued production of AquaBall®, we notified Disney of our desire to terminate the Disney License in early 2018. As a result of our decision to discontinue the production of AquaBall® and terminate the Disney License, and considering amounts due, Disney drew from a letter of credit funded by Red Beard in the amount of $378,000 on or about June 1, 2018. Subsequently, Disney agreed to a settlement and release of all claims related to the Disney License in consideration for the payment to Disney of $42,000.
 Government Regulations
  
 The production, distribution and sale in the United States of our product is subject to various U.S. federal and state regulations, including but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, including as amended by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; and a number of other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, marketing, labeling and ingredients of such product.
  
 Certain states and localities prohibit the sale of certain beverages unless a deposit or tax is charged for containers. These requirements vary by each jurisdiction. Similar legislation has been proposed in certain other states and localities, as well as by Congress. We are unable to predict whether such legislation will be enacted or what impact its enactment would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
  
 All of our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Although compliance with these provisions has not had any material adverse effect on our financial or competitive position, compliance with or violation of any current or future regulations and legislation could require material expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
  
  We believe that current and reasonably foreseeable governmental regulation will have minimal impact on our business.
  
  Employees
  
 We had one employee as of December 31, 2018. In addition, we currently contract with certain former managers and other professionals to continue operations.
  
  Compliance with Environmental Laws
  
 In California, we are required to collect redemption values from our retail customers and to remit such redemption values to the State of California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold. In certain other states where our product is sold, we are also required to collect deposits from our customers and to remit such deposits to the respective jurisdictions based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold in such states.
