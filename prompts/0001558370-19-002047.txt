ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 For purposes of this Form 10-K, we define an "Active Customer" as a customer who has transacted with us in any of the eight most recently completed fiscal quarters prior to the date of measurement. Unless otherwise indicated, the date of measurement is December 31, 2018, our most recently completed fiscal quarter. Additionally, references herein to the approximately 9 million U.S. households that own a recreational vehicle are based on The RV Consumer in 2011, an industry report published by the University of Michigan in 2011 (the "RV Survey"), which we believe to be the most recent such survey.
 Our Company
 Camping World Holdings, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, referred to as “Camping World”, “the Company”, “we”, “us” or “our” unless specified otherwise) is America’s largest retailer of recreational vehicles (“RVs”) and RV-related products and services, and a large retailer of outdoor lifestyle and active sports-related products and services. Our mission is to bring families and friends together through the enjoyment of the RV and outdoor lifestyle. To best serve the estimated 9 million U.S. households that own an RV and our base of 5.1 million Active Customers, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of services, protection plans, products and resources for RV and outdoor enthusiasts through our national network of retail locations and our direct marketing business. The lifestyle element of the RV and outdoor industry, our comprehensive assortment of products and services, and the multi-year nature of many of our products and services allows us to build long-lasting relationships with our customers that we are continuously looking to enhance and grow. We segment our business into three different areas, Consumer Services and Plans, Dealership and

Retail, and we provide our product and service offerings primarily through our three iconic brands, Good Sam, Camping World, and Gander.


(1) | Certain dealership locations without an accompanying retail location will also sell RV accessories, maintenance products and supplies.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We believe our Consumer Services and Plans business, consisting in part of our Good Sam branded offerings, provides the RV industry’s broadest and deepest range of such plans and programs. Across our extended vehicle service contracts, emergency roadside assistance, property and casualty insurance programs and membership clubs, we experienced high annual retention rates that ranged between 64% and 68%, 64% and 71%, and 65% and 74%, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We also operate the Good Sam Club, which we believe is the largest RV organization in the world, with approximately 2.1 million members as of December 31, 2018. Membership benefits include a variety of discounts, exclusive benefits, specialty publications and other membership benefits, all of which we believe enhance the RV experience, drive customer engagement and provide cross-selling opportunities for our other services, protection plans and products.
 We believe we are the largest retailer of RVs and RV-related products and services in the United States, and a large retailer of products and services for outdoor activities and active sports enthusiasts. Our Dealership and Retail segments shared a total of 227 retail locations across 36 states as of December 31, 2018. A majority of our locations offer Dealership and/or Retail related products and services under the Camping World, Gander Outdoors, and/or Gander RV branded storefronts. Our retail locations are strategically located in key national RV markets and are staffed with knowledgeable local team members, providing customers access to extensive RV expertise. In 2018, our network of Dealership and Retail locations generated approximately 7.4 million transactions, continuing to build our Active Customer database.

 We attract new customers primarily through our retail locations, e‑commerce platforms and direct marketing operations. Once we acquire customers through a transaction, they become part of our customer database where we leverage customized customer relationship management (“CRM”) tools and analytics to actively engage, market and sell numerous products and services. Our goal is to consistently increase our database of customers and cross-sell our products and services through our various channels of operation to continue gaining market share in the RV and outdoor recreational markets.
 Our Strengths
 Our Iconic Brands. With over fifty years of history dating back to 1966 for the Camping World and Good Sam brands and 1960 for the Gander brand, we believe the Camping World, Good Sam and Gander (previously Gander Mountain) brands are iconic, industry-defining brands that are synonymous with the RV and outdoor lifestyle. Our consistent quality, commitment to customer satisfaction, breadth and depth of offerings, and comprehensive range of RV and outdoor lifestyle products, services, and resources drive a passionate, loyal following by our customers and an enduring trust in our brands.
 Comprehensive Portfolio of Services, Protection Plans and Products. We believe we are the only provider of a comprehensive portfolio of services, protection plans, products and resources for RV and outdoor enthusiasts. We offer more than 10,000 products and services through our retail locations and membership clubs. Our offerings are based on over 50 years of experience and customer feedback from RV and outdoor enthusiasts. Further, we evaluate new products and, through acquisitions or our supplier collaborations, offer a number of unique products that are developed based on customer feedback, including private label products. 
 Customer Database. As of December 31, 2018, we had over 29.0 million unique RV and outdoor related contacts in our database, of which approximately 5.1 million were Active Customers. We use a customized CRM system and database analytics to track customers and selectively market and cross sell our offerings. We believe our customer database is a competitive advantage and significant barrier to entry.
 Leading Market Position and Scale. We believe we are the largest retailer of RVs in the United States, and a large retailer of products and services for outdoor activities and active sports enthusiasts, and we believe Good Sam is the largest RV organization in the world. This affords us an attractive opportunity to build customer loyalty by engaging with and supporting customers with all of their RV needs and helping families and friends enjoy the RV and outdoor lifestyle. Our scale and our long-term stability make us attractive to our suppliers, financiers and real estate investors. The strong relationship with our suppliers enables us to negotiate attractive product pricing and availability. We also align with our suppliers on product development in which we leverage our customer base to provide feedback in exchange for exclusive early launch periods for new products. In recent years, we have also leveraged our supplier relationships to introduce private label products, which has improved our product availability.  
 Core of High Margin, Recurring Revenue. At the core of our offerings are certain high margin products and services targeting the installed base of RV households and outdoor enthusiasts that generate recurring revenue streams. These offerings include certain Consumer Services and Plan offerings, which we believe are characterized by increased customer engagement, such as our extended vehicle service contracts, emergency roadside assistance, property and casualty insurance programs and membership clubs. As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had 3.1 million, 2.8 million, and 2.6 million participants, respectively, across these Consumer Services and Plan offerings, including those who participated in more than one of our offerings. The increased engagement of our customers in these areas has led to high annual retention rates. Across our extended vehicle service contracts, emergency roadside assistance, property and casualty insurance programs and membership clubs, for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we experienced high annual retention rates that ranged between 64% and 68%, 64% and 71%, and 65% and 74%, respectively. These offerings also include our Retail parts, services and other offerings, which we believe to be stable and more consistent than the sale of new and used vehicles. Concentrating on our Consumer Services and Plans and Retail parts, services and other offerings has allowed us to grow a core of recurring revenue with gross margins of 59.5% and 33.5% respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is higher than our consolidated gross margins of 28.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018.

 Variable Cost Structure and Capital Efficient Model. Our decentralized and flat management structure coupled with incentive programs focused on sales, profitability and customer satisfaction have allowed us to achieve a highly variable cost structure. Our database analytics provide us significant flexibility and meaningfully improve our marketing efficiency via nimble, targeted marketing programs. We believe our model improves margin stability through economic cycles, resulting in what we believe to be high cash flow generation, low capital expenditure requirements and impressive returns on invested capital. As a result, we have been successful in generating access to highly attractive real estate and floor plan financing terms, thereby reducing costs and significantly reducing our need for capital. This capital efficient model provides a large share of capital funding at attractive terms for new locations and acquisitions.
 Experienced Team. Our management team has an average of 17 years of industry experience. We offer highly competitive compensation tightly tied to performance, which has allowed us to attract and retain our highly experienced management team. Since 2013, our team has increased total revenue from $2.3 billion to $4.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased net income from $16.9 million to $65.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and increased Adjusted EBITDA from $164.6 million to $312.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K.
 Our Growth Strategy
 We believe our strong brands, our comprehensive portfolio of services, protection plans, products and resources, coupled with our extensive customer database, leading market position and expanded focus on customer service will continue to provide us with competitive advantages in targeting and capturing a larger share of the RV and outdoor recreational markets. With the highly fragmented nature of the RV retail industry and the convergence of the RV and outdoor recreational markets, we believe there are substantial opportunities to continue growing our business through the expansion of our customer base and by cross-selling our growing portfolio of products and services. We attract new customers primarily through adding new retail locations, target marketing, and expanding into adjacent products, services and channels of distribution. Once we acquire customers through a transaction, they become part of our customer database where we leverage customized CRM tools and analytics to actively engage, market and sell numerous products and services. Our goal is to increase our database of customers and cross-selling of products and services through our various channels of operation.
 Grow Our Active Base of Customers. We expect to continue to grow our customer base primarily through adding new retail locations, targeted marketing and expanding into adjacent products, services and channels of distribution.

· | New Retail Locations. Through Dealership acquisitions, Retail expansions and the opening of new greenfield locations, we have expanded our number of Dealership and Retail locations to 227 as of December 31, 2018 from 153 as of December 31, 2017.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  oDealership Acquisitions.  The RV dealership industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent RV dealers, and with our significant scale advantage, we believe we are uniquely positioned to lead a strategic consolidation of this market. We use acquisitions of independent dealers as a fast and capital efficient alternative to new retail location openings to expand our business and grow our customer base. We believe our experience and scale allow us to both acquire these locations at attractive valuations, and to operate them more efficiently and with significantly improved product, service and support offerings. Since 2012, we have successfully acquired and integrated a net of 59 new dealership locations. Most of our Dealership acquisitions are profitable within two full calendar months after completion, with turn around acquisitions sometimes taking a few months longer. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions that we believe will grow our Active Customer base and present attractive risk adjusted returns and significant value creation opportunities. 
 oRetail Expansion. With the convergence of the RV and outdoor recreational markets, we believe there is significant opportunity for us to widen our target customer base by opening new locations, expanding our outdoor recreational product and service offerings, and enhancing the benefits of our Good Sam Club. To this end, we made significant investments in infrastructure, inventory, and people over the past two years and believe we are well positioned to leverage those investments to drive future growth. As a component of this strategy, we made several strategic acquisitions in the Retail segment in 2017 and 2018 as follows: 
 On May 26, 2017, we acquired certain assets of Gander Mountain Company (“Gander Mountain”) and its Overton’s, Inc. (“Overton’s”) marine and watersports business through a bankruptcy auction. Prior to the bankruptcy, Gander Mountain operated 160 retail locations and an e-commerce business that serviced the hunting, camping, fishing, shooting sports, and outdoor markets. Following our acquisition, we rebranded the Gander Mountain business as Gander Outdoors and began opening the rebranded Gander Outdoors stores in December, 2017. The rebranded Gander Outdoors stores offer a variety of RV and outdoor related products and services. As of December 31, 2018, the Gander Outdoors and Overton’s business consisted of 61 retail stores and an e-commerce and direct marketing business. 
 From August 17, 2017 to April 19, 2018, we acquired several other specialty retail businesses, that collectively operated a total of 23 specialty store locations on December 31, 2018, including:
 •  Active Sports, Inc. which included TheHouse.com, (“TheHouse.com”), an online retail component of the business, specializing in bikes, sailboards, skateboards, wakeboards, snowboards and outdoor gear with three locations; 
 •EIGHTEEN0THREE LLC, dba W82 (“W82”), a specialty retailer of snowboarding, skateboarding, longboarding, swimwear, footwear, apparel and accessories with two store locations;
 •Uncle Dan's LTD, (“Uncle Dan’s”), a specialty retailer of outdoor gear, apparel and camping supplies with six store locations; 
 •Erehwon Mountain Outfitter, (“Erehwon”), a specialty retailer of outdoor gear, apparel and camping supplies with four store locations; and

 
  11

 

 •Rock Creek Outfitters (“Rock Creek”), a specialty retailer of outdoor gear for kayaking, rock climbing, camping and hiking with eight store locations. 

o | New Greenfield Dealership Locations. We utilize proprietary data and analytical tools to target new greenfield dealership locations. We believe there is ample white space for additional development opportunities. Since 2012, we have successfully opened 23 new greenfield locations. Most of our new greenfield locations are cash flow positive within two-to-three full calendar months after opening. We intend to continue to carefully evaluate potential locations and open sites that we believe present attractive risk adjusted returns and significant value creation opportunities while helping to grow our customer base.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The table below summarizes our store locations as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:

 | 2018 | | 2017 | 2016
Co-habited Dealership and Retail locations | | 126 | | 116 | 104
Stand-alone Dealership locations | | 15 | | 8 | 1 
Stand-alone Retail locations | | 86 | | 29 | 17 
Total locations | | 227 | | 153 | 122

      For the year ended December 31, 2018, we closed three Dealership locations, three Retail locations that were Camping World RV parts and accessory stores, seven Retail locations that were Gander Outdoors stores, and two Retail locations that were Overton’s stores.

· | Targeted Marketing. We continuously work to attract new customers to our existing retail and online locations through targeted marketing, attractive introductory offerings and access to our wide array of resources for RV and outdoor enthusiasts. We have focused specifically on marketing to the fast‑growing demographic of younger market entrants, and through our NASCAR Truck Series and participation at college athletic events and music festivals, we believe we attract an outsized share of younger RV owners to our platform. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Adjacent Products, Services and Channels of Distribution. Through relationships with existing suppliers and through acquisitions, we will look to selectively expand into adjacent products, services and channels of distribution. With the convergence of the RV and outdoor recreational markets we believe there is significant opportunity for us to grow our market share by broadening our product assortment, expanding our retail footprint and further developing our online and e-commerce platforms. Similarly, an opportunistic vertical acquisition strategy allows us to earn an increased margin on our services, protection plans and products, and we evaluate such acquisitions that can allow us to capture additional sales from our customers at attractive risk adjusted returns. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cross Selling Our Growing Portfolio of Products and Services. Our comprehensive portfolio of RV and outdoor products and services, coupled with our expanding database of more than 29.0 million unique RV-related and outdoor recreation-related contacts, provides us with the opportunity to grow by cross selling our array of products and services. We use our customized CRM system and database analytics to proactively market and cross sell to Active Customers.

 Our Business Segments
 We operate through three reportable segments: Consumer Services and Plans, Dealership, and Retail. In 2018, we realigned the structure of our internal organization in a manner that caused the composition of our reportable segments to change.

See Note 22 — Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our reportable segments. Through our retail locations, e-commerce platforms and clubs, we offer RV owners and outdoor enthusiasts the full spectrum of services, protection plans, products and resources that we believe are essential to operate, maintain, protect and to enjoy the RV and outdoor lifestyle. Our Consumer Services and Plans include:

We do not share the underwriting risk of the insurance programs and we receive a marketing fee based on the amount of premium paid to the insurance providers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Membership clubs. We operate two membership clubs: The Good Sam Club and the Coast to Coast Club.

Essex Credit provides the financing and assumes full underwriting and credit risk, and we receive a marketing fee based on the referred business. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Travel protection. We contract with On Call International to offer travel protection plans through Good Sam TravelAssist, where On Call International primarily assumes the underwriting risk through third-party underwriters. The plans provide 24/7 coverage for emergency medical evacuation, return-home services, emergency medical monitoring, as well as other travel assistance services. Prices range from $50 to $170 per policy per year depending on coverage. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 211,000 contracts in force primarily underwritten by On Call’s International’s underwriter, Inter Hannover. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapters hold campouts, plan social events and organize community volunteer opportunities. In 2018, our Good Sam Club and Chapters hosted 66 events, which provide the social interaction associated with the RV lifestyle. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Consumer shows. During 2018, we promoted and operated 30 separate consumer shows in 26 different cities across 16 different states. The primary focus of these consumer shows is to promote the RV and outdoor sports lifestyle with the sales of new RVs, accessories and destination options. During 2018, the shows attracted in excess of 285,000 participants in total. Our consumer show division acquired eight new shows in five cities in four states in 2018.

On our Good Sam website, www.goodsam.com, and through our printed travel and campground directory, Good Sam RV Travel and Savings Guide, RV enthusiasts can plan trips by, among other things, searching campgrounds based on destination or particular needs and reading reviews. Good Sam Club members can search for parks that offer the Good Sam Club discount.

Each of our businesses has a distinct Web presence where consumers can learn about the services we provide, get rate quotes (as applicable), make purchases and interact with us on an ongoing basis. We make use of cross-selling and on-site marketing to present additional products to consumers as they visit our websites and transact business with us. We are active on social media, including Facebook, to support and promote the RV lifestyle, to engage with our customers and to reach potential new customers on an ongoing basis.

social media contacts. Our multiple contact center strategy gives us the opportunity to establish redundant systems and cross training. This provides back up in the event of a natural disaster, power outages or weather issues that can affect any individual location, and allows calls to be routed to another contact center to ensure our customer experience stays at a high level.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our Dealership Offerings include:
 New Vehicles. We offer a comprehensive selection of new RVs across a range of price points, classes and floor plans, from entry level travel trailers to Class A diesel pushers, at our retail locations and on our e-commerce platform. We have formed strategic alliances with leading RV manufacturers, including Thor Industries, Inc., Forest River, Inc., and Winnebago Industries, Inc.

     Used Vehicles. We sell a comprehensive selection of used RVs at our retail locations, including the vehicle types listed in the table above.

Used RVs that do not meet our standards for retail sale are typically sold at wholesale auctions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold approximately 32,800 used vehicles.
 Dealership Parts, Services and Other, including:

· | Repair and Maintenance. We offer repair and maintenance services at 128 of our retail locations nationwide as of December 31, 2018 and perform warranty repairs for RVs.

  Finance and Insurance, including:

· | Vehicle financing. Through arrangements with third-party lenders, such as Bank of America, Bank of the West, US Bank, and M&T Bank, and other regional and local banks and credit unions, we are able to provide financing for most new and used RVs we sell through our retail locations. Generally, our financing transactions are structured through long-term retail installment sales contracts (with terms of up to 20 years), which we enter into with our customers on behalf of our third-party lenders, which have provided initial, non-binding approval to assume our position as creditor. The retail installment sales contracts are assigned on a non-recourse basis, with the third-party lender assuming underwriting and credit risk. In 2018, we arranged financing transactions for approximately 75% of our total number of new and used units sold for which we earn a commission from the third-party lender.

  Customers and Markets
 The estimated number of U.S. households that own an RV is approximately 9 million, which we believe has grown consistently over the past 20 years, including during the last economic downturn. We have approximately 5.1 million RV-related and outdoor-related Active Customers and aim to market and sell our services, protection plans, products and resources to a growing number of new market entrants.
 The recreational vehicle industry is characterized by RV enthusiasts’ investment in, and steadfast commitment to, the RV lifestyle. Owners purchase insurance, extended service contracts, roadside assistance and regular maintenance in order to protect and maintain their RV. They typically invest in new accessories and the necessary installation costs as they upgrade their RV. They also spend on services and resources as they plan, engage in, and return from their road trips. Furthermore, based on industry research and management’s estimates, we believe that RV owners typically trade-in to buy another RV every four to five years.

In 2018, approximately 484,000 new RVs were shipped by manufacturers according to the RV Industry Association survey of manufacturers reports. Overall, from 2012 to 2018, the number of RV shipments grew by a compounded annual rate of 9.7%. There are two main categories of RVs: motorhomes (motorized units) and towables (units that are towed behind a car, van or pickup). Motorized units include Class C Motorhomes, with prices for new units typically ranging from $57,000 to $92,000, Class A Gas Motorhomes, with prices for new units typically ranging from $75,000 to $114,000, Class A Diesel Motorhomes, with prices for new units typically ranging from $128,000 to $318,000, and Class B Motorhomes, with prices for new units typically ranging from $64,000 to $104,000. Towable units include travel trailers with prices for new units typically ranging from $15,000 to $29,000 and fifth-wheel trailers, with prices for new units typically ranging from $35,000 to $63,000. According to data gathered by Statistical Surveys, Inc., which tracks the number of RV registrations in every state except Hawaii and Alaska, from 2011 to 2018, the average annual new unit sales growth of diesel motorhomes, gas motorhomes and towables was 4.7%, 17.4% and 12.1%, respectively. RV manufacturers are now producing more innovative models, such as lightweight towables and smaller, fuel efficient motorhomes. In addition, green technologies, such as solar panels and energy efficient components are appearing on an increasing number of RVs.
 Generally, used RVs are sold at a lower price level than comparable new RVs and the sale of used vehicles has historically been more stable through business cycles than the sale of new vehicles.
 We believe RV trips remain the least expensive type of vacation and allow RV owners to travel more while spending less. RV trips offer savings on a variety of vacation costs, including, among others, airfare, lodging and dining. While fuel costs are a component of the overall vacation cost, we believe fluctuations in fuel prices are not a significant factor affecting a family’s decision to take RV trips. We believe the average annual mileage use of an RV is between 3,000 miles and 5,000 miles.
 Additionally, according to The 2018 North American Camping Report, the total number of camping households in the U.S. is estimated at 77 million households, up by more than 6 million since 2014. The popularity of camping is growing across all ages, demographics and ethnic groups, with the largest growth of new campers coming from Asian, Hispanic and African American descent. Campers are increasing the 

 
  17

 
amount of time they camp each year, with the number of campers who camp three times or more each year increasing by 64% since 2014. As campers age, they are more likely to use RVs as part of their camping experience. From 2014 to 2017, the number of campers using an RV to camp increased to an estimated 24% from 21% and 7-in-10 RV campers were Millennials or Generation X consumers. The camping and RV industry are expected to benefit from baby boomers reaching retirement age and Generation X and Millennial consumers reach their prime camping age. As of July 1, 2016 (the latest date for which population estimates are available), Millennials age 20-35 in 2016, numbered 71 million individuals in the United States, and Baby Boomers ages 52-70 numbered 74 million.
 In addition to positive demographic trends, according to the RV Survey, the typical RV customer has, on average, a household income of approximately $75,000. This is approximately 50% higher than the median household income of the broader United States population at the time of the RV survey, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The higher average income has resulted in a more resilient RV consumer with greater buying power across economic cycles.
 Taken together, we believe the savings RVs offer on a variety of vacation costs and the increase in the pool of potential RV customers due to favorable demographic trends should continue to grow the installed base of RV owners, and will have a positive impact on RV usage and demand for our array of products and services.
 The customer base for our Retail stores that sell outdoor lifestyle products is broad and varied, and includes anyone who participates in outdoor lifestyle sports and recreational activities, such as hunting, fishing, boating, camping, skiing, snowboarding, paddle boarding, hiking, rock climbing, whitewater rafting, and more. With our strong presence in both retail stores and online, our active and outdoor customers live across the United States and are outdoor enthusiasts. Our core strategy is to provide these customers with a unique and broad assortment of outdoor equipment, accessories, related technical apparel and footwear, expert services, convenient locations and value pricing.

 Our Retail Locations
 As of December 31, 2018, we operated 227 retail locations across 36 states. Our retail locations are strategically located in key RV and outdoor markets and a majority of our locations offer Dealership and/or Retail related products and services under the Camping World, Gander Outdoors, and/or Gander RV branded storefronts. A map of our location footprint is below: Store Design and Layout
 We present our broad and deep array of services, protection plans, products and resources in a convenient and engaging atmosphere to meet the everyday needs of RV and outdoor enthusiasts. The majority of our retail locations offer Dealership and/or Retail related products and services under the Camping World and our Gander Outdoors branded storefronts. As such, the majority of our locations contain an RV sales area, an RV and outdoor parts, products and accessories area, a customer service area, a service, repair and installation area, and office and warehouse space. In our Dealership locations, large parking areas provide sufficient space to facilitate maneuvering of RVs, and the area devoted to new and used RV inventory typically ranges from three to twelve acres. While each of our locations are different, the square footage dedicated to the sale of RV and outdoor parts and accessories averages approximately 8,000 square feet in our Camping World Retail locations and between 16,000 and 96,000 square feet in our Gander Outdoors locations. Our stand-alone outdoor retail locations average approximately 35,000 selling square feet with convenient access to a major highway. These stand-alone locations have an open-style and inviting shopping environment characterized by wide aisles with high-end displays and racking. These stores are category-focused and feature an extensive selection of leading national and regional brands as well as company-owned brands. 
 The majority of our Dealership locations feature service centers staffed with expert, in-house trained product specialists and are equipped with merchandise demonstrations to assist in educating customers about RV performance products. Our Retail locations also provide opportunities to promote a more interactive and consultative selling environment. Our staff is trained to cross-sell and explain the benefits of our breadth of services, protection plans and products to which our customers have become accustomed, such as extended service contracts, emergency roadside assistance products, club memberships, discount camping and travel assistance. We tailor our retail locations that sell outdoor products with merchandise assortments to take advantage of our customer’s seasonal and local/regional preferences. We seek to combine this broad 

 
  19

 
product offering with superior customer services based on our store associate’s extensive product knowledge and outdoor-related experience.
 We regularly refresh our retail locations to enhance the customers’ shopping experience and maximize product and service offerings. New products and services are introduced in order to capitalize on the advances of the RV industry and to satisfy our customers’ needs. Store dress, promotional signage and directional signage are also periodically refreshed to further enhance our customers’ shopping experience at our retail locations.
 We also believe there is significant opportunity for us to widen our target customer by expanding our outdoor recreational product and service offering. By targeting a broader group of outdoor recreational enthusiasts and enhancing the membership benefits of our Good Sam Club, we believe we have the opportunity to expand our base of customers and enhance the long-term value of our consumer services and plans business. Consistent with this strategy, we made several strategic acquisitions in the Retail segment in 2017 and 2018, including Gander Mountain and Overton’s, Active Sports, Inc., W82, Uncle Dan’s, Erehwon and Rock Creek.
 Expansion Opportunities and Site Selection
 Our expansion and dealership acquisition strategy focuses on growing our Active Customer base. We have developed a rigorous and flexible process that employs proprietary data and analytical tools to identify target markets for new store openings and acquisitions. We select sites for new locations or evaluate dealership acquisition opportunities based on criteria such as local demographics, traffic patterns, proximity to RV parks and campgrounds, proximity to major interstates, analytics from our Active Customer database, RV sales and registrations, product availability and availability of attractive acquisition and/or lease terms. Our prospective dealership sites are typically located on major highways with convenient access and high visibility. Depending on market demographics, our prospective dealership sites generally include 8 to 18 acres and accommodate a 30,000 to 85,000 square foot retail footprint and 5 to 12 acres for RV inventory. Most of our new Dealership greenfield locations are profitable within two-to-three full calendar months after opening. Most of our Dealership acquisitions are profitable within two full calendar months after completion, with turn around acquisitions sometimes taking a few months longer.
 As the market leader, with a scalable cost structure, we have an established track record of successful dealership acquisitions. Over the last three years ended December 31, 2018, we have spent over $296 million, net of financing under our Seventh Amended and Restated Credit Agreement for floor plan financing (as further amended, the “Floor Plan Facility”), on 25 dealership acquisitions that included 34 dealership retail locations, at multiples of acquired EBITDA in the low to mid-single digit range. We target most acquisitions to result in cash-on-cash payback periods of under a year, and have designed an identification, assessment, negotiation, acquisition, and closing set of processes and procedures that allow us to move quickly on opportunities.
 Store Level Management and Training
 In 2018, our President of Camping World oversaw all dealership operations. Our individual dealership locations were managed by a senior vice president of operations, each of whom was typically responsible for 28 to 49 locations. Depending on the number of dealership locations managed by any senior vice president of operations, the senior vice president of operations may have one or more market managers responsible for a smaller number of locations. Our senior vice presidents of operations had, on average, 24 years of experience in the RV industry and have been employed by us for 13 years. Our President of Camping World Dealerships resigned in December 2018 and the four senior vice presidents of operations were promoted to division RV presidents and manage the dealership operations, reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer.
 Each dealership location employs a general manager or a general sales manager (in either case, the “GM”) that has responsibility for the daily operations of the dealership or combined dealership and retail location. Areas of responsibility include inventory management, hiring, associate training and development, maintenance of the facilities, customer service, and customer satisfaction. A GM’s management team 

 
  20

 
includes a sales manager, a parts and accessories manager, a service manager, and a finance and insurance manager to help oversee the operations of each retail location department. A typical retail location employs approximately 30 to 120 full-time equivalent employees.
 We employ a national director of inventory and a centralized inventory management team to oversee our RV inventory and provide consistency and controls in the ordering, purchasing and distribution of RV inventory. We also employ a national director of service, a national director of parts and accessories, and a national director of finance and insurance to assist in the management and training for the respective areas.
 We actively seek to improve our ability to assess talent during the interview process, hire talented people, and provide extensive training programs and opportunities for our employees, including, among others, new-hire training and orientations, e-learning and training modules, national training directors and certification programs for our RV technicians.
 Product Sourcing and Distribution
 Sourcing
 New and Used RVs
 We generally acquire new RVs for retail sale directly from the applicable manufacturer. We have strategic contractual arrangements with leading RV manufacturers, including Thor Industries, Inc., Forest River, Inc., and Winnebago Industries, Inc., with such manufacturers supplying approximately 73.8%, 15.3%, and 5.9%, respectively, of our new RV inventory as of December 31, 2018. According to the latest annual report on Form 10-K of Thor Industries, Inc., we are their largest customer, representing 20% of latest fiscal year revenue. We maintain a central inventory management and purchasing group to manage and maintain adequate inventory levels and mix. RVs are transported directly from a manufacturer’s facility to our retail locations via a third-party transportation company. According to the RV Industry Association, the total number of RV shipments declined in 2018 and is expected to further decline in 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 3% of our Dealership merchandise was imported directly from vendors located in foreign countries, with a substantial portion of the imported merchandise being obtained directly from vendors in Canada.
 Our strategy is to partner with financially sound manufacturers that make quality products, have adequate manufacturing capacity and distribution, and maintain an appropriate product mix. In certain instances, our manufacturing partners produce private label products exclusively available at our retail locations and through our e-commerce platforms.
 Our supply arrangements with manufacturers are typically governed by dealer agreements, which are customary in the RV industry. Our dealer agreements with manufacturers are generally made on a location-by-location basis. The terms of these dealer agreements are typically subject to, among other things, us meeting all the requirements and conditions of the manufacturer’s applicable programs, us maintaining certain minimum inventory requirements and meeting certain retail sales objectives, us performing services and repairs for all owners of the manufacturer’s RVs (regardless from whom the RV was purchased) that are still under warranty and us carrying the manufacturer’s parts and accessories needed to service and repair the manufacturer’s RVs in stock at all times, us actively advertising and promoting the manufacturer’s RVs and us indemnifying the manufacturer under certain circumstances. Our dealer agreements generally designate a specific geographical territory for us, which is often exclusive to us, provided that we are able to meet the material obligations of the applicable dealer agreement. In addition, many of our dealer agreements contain stocking level requirements and certain of our dealer agreements contain contractual provisions concerning minimum advertised product pricing for current model year units. Wholesale pricing is generally established on a model year basis and is subject to change in the manufacturer’s sole discretion. In certain cases, the manufacturer may also establish a suggested retail price, below which we cannot advertise that manufacturer’s RVs.
 We generally acquire used RVs from customers, primarily through trade-ins, as well as through auctions and other sources, and we generally recondition used RVs acquired for retail sale in our parts and 

 
  21

 
service departments. Used RVs that we do not sell at our retail locations generally are sold at wholesale prices through auctions.
 We finance the purchase of substantially all of our new RV inventory from manufacturers through our Floor Plan Facility. Used vehicles may also be financed from time to time through our Floor Plan Facility. For more information on our Floor Plan Facility, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Description of Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Floor Plan Facility” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and Note 4 — Inventories, net and Notes Payable — Floor Plan, net to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
 Parts, Accessories, and Outdoor Lifestyle Products
 The purchasing activities for our parts and accessories departments are focused on RV maintenance products, outdoor lifestyle products, RV parts and accessories, such as, among others, generators and electrical, satellite receivers and GPS, towing and hitching products and RV appliances, essential supplies and other products and services necessary or desirable for the RV lifestyle. We maintain central purchasing, replenishment and distribution functions to manage inventory planning, allocate merchandise to our retail locations and oversee the replenishment of basic merchandise to our distribution centers. We have no long-term purchase commitments. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased merchandise from approximately 2,400 vendors with no vendor accounting for more than approximately 5% of total merchandise purchased. During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 4% of our merchandise was imported directly from vendors located in foreign countries, with a substantial portion of the imported merchandise being obtained directly from vendors in China. We have established long-standing, continuous relationships with our largest vendors. We believe that the volume of merchandise we purchase from domestic and international suppliers and our ability to buy direct from manufacturers enables us to obtain merchandise at costs which compare favorably to local RV dealers and retailers.
 Our merchant team located in Bowling Green, Kentucky, Bloomington Minnesota, and Greenville, North Carolina currently manages our parts and accessories sourcing. To ensure our product offerings are tailored to local market conditions and demand, our merchant team routinely meets one-on-one with vendors, attends trade shows, reviews trade periodicals and evaluates merchandise offered by other retail and online merchants. We also consistently gather feedback and new product reviews from our store management and employees, as well as from reviews submitted by our customers. We believe this feedback is valuable to our vendor-partners and improves our access to new models and technologies.
 Distribution and Fulfillment
 We have historically distributed our RV merchandise from three leased distribution and fulfillment centers located in Franklin, Kentucky, Bakersfield, California, and Fort Worth, Texas, which were 250,000, 169,123, and 197,400 square feet, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we closed our distribution center in Fort Worth, Texas and consolidated the distribution of our RV merchandise in our Franklin, Kentucky, Bakersfield, California and Lebanon, Indiana distribution facilities. These three distribution centers support replenishment of parts and accessories for our retail locations and manage the fulfillment of Camping World direct-to-consumer e-commerce and catalog orders. We use common carriers for replenishment of our retail locations and ship merchandise to our e-commerce customers via courier service. An experienced distribution management team leads a staff of approximately 120 full-time distribution center employees.
 We distribute our Gander Outdoors, Overton’s and other specialty retail merchandise from a combination of leased or owned distribution centers in Greenville, North Carolina (two locations), Lebanon, Indiana, St. Paul, Minnesota, Chattanooga, TN, and Skokie, Illinois, which are 497,133, 707,952, 214,000, 44,583 and 5,986 square feet, respectively. These six distribution centers support replenishment of Gander Outdoors, Overton’s and our other specialty retail stores as of December 31, 2018 and manage the fulfillment of our Gander Outdoors, Overton’s and other specialty stores direct-to-consumer e-commerce orders. We use common carriers for replenishment of our retail locations and ship merchandise to our e-commerce 

 
  22

 
customers via courier service. Our experienced distribution management team leads a staff of approximately 260 full-time employees at these distribution centers.
 Our distribution centers have scalable systems and processes that we believe can accommodate continued new store growth. We use an Oracle enterprise system to procure inventory, manage online customer and retail demand and fulfill orders through the warehouse management module. Additionally, we have customized an order packing and shipping software package to handle the specific requirements of the e-commerce and retail business. We have the capability to both case pick and item pick, which is designed to ensure our retail locations have sufficient quantities of product while also allowing us to maintain in inventory slow moving but necessary items. This balance allows us to stock the right products at the necessary locations, all at the right time and in the correct quantity.
 Marketing and Advertising
 We market our Consumer Services and Plans and Good Sam branded offerings through retail point of sale, websites, e-mail, direct mail, inserts, paid search, space advertisements, promotional events, member-get-a-member campaigns, and telemarketing. In 2018, retail point of sale marketing efforts accounted for approximately 80% of new paid enrollments in our Good Sam Club. We generally use our internal proprietary database for marketing and advertising. As of December 31, 2018, we had over 29.0 million unique RV and outdoor related contacts in our database, of which approximately 5.1 million were Active Customers.
 We market our Camping World brand through the strategic location of our retail stores in high traffic RV areas, in-store promotions, our websites, mail order catalogs, direct mail retail flyers, local TV and radio, RV and outdoor shows, billboards, newspaper, email, paid search, advertisements in national and regional industry publications, vendor co-op advertising programs, promotional events, and personal solicitations and referrals. Camping World’s principal marketing strategy is to capitalize on its broad name recognition among RV owners.
 We market our Gander Outdoors brand through our retail stores, websites, in-store promotions, social media, local TV, outdoors shows, direct mail, digital, vendor co-op programs, print publications including newspaper, regional and national publications along with partnerships with local conservation groups. Gander Outdoors continued marketing goal is to grow its customer file and leverage learned customer preference in order to strategically position itself within the marketplace for the outdoor enthusiast.
 We currently operate an extensive network of RV lifestyle related websites, including www.goodsamclub.com, www.campingworld.com and www.goodsamcamping.com, that collectively experienced approximately 129 million visitor sessions in 2018. Our websites feature RV and RV lifestyle associated content, as well as the ability to purchase parts, services and accessories that enhance the RV lifestyle. We believe our network of websites provide RV owners and enthusiasts with the most expansive access to RV related content and e-commerce in the RV industry. Our websites also allow RV owners and enthusiasts to read about the RV lifestyle, make purchases and gather more information about RV parks and other RV-related entities.
 In addition to websites, our digital presence includes apps and services that enable current and potential RV owners and enthusiasts to research RVs, read product reviews written by RV experts and other RV owners and enthusiasts, plan RV trips (including mapping routes and planning which RV parks to visit) and purchase thousands of products to support their RV lifestyle. We use various digital tools and services to foster the RV lifestyle and to introduce new and/or future RV owners and enthusiasts to our network of websites and the products and services we offer. Our wide-reaching digital presence provides extensive marketing for the products and services we sell, while providing the RV community with access to valuable content and tools to enhance the RV lifestyle.
 We also use promotional events as marketing tools. During 2018, we promoted and operated 30 consumer shows in 26 cities across 16 states which are primarily RV, boat, and sport shows. The total audience of RV, boating, powersports and outdoor recreation enthusiasts who attended our shows during 2018 exceeded 285,000. Our consumer show division acquired eight new shows in five cities in four states in 

 
  23

 
2018. In addition, we have sponsored sporting events such as Major League Baseball, the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races, and the College Football Camping World Bowl. Periodically we promote the opening of each new retail location through grand opening celebrations at which we may have special events and discounted prices.
 E-Commerce Platform and Digital Strategy
 We believe our websites and other digital marketing channels enable us to provide instant, on-demand access to the wide array of content, products and services we offer. Our content, such as RV park descriptions, ratings and user reviews, encourage RV owners and enthusiasts, whether or not current customers or members, to visit our websites.
 We use a combination of targeted email, social media and e-newsletters to promote ongoing communication with our customers and members. We believe that by communicating with our customers and members on an ongoing basis, we build affinity and the likelihood of a continued consumer to business relationship.
 We believe our websites help attract new customers who may not live near one of our retail locations, who desire to transact business online or who are discovering us for the first time. Additionally, we believe many people who transact at our retail locations visit our websites prior to visiting our retail locations. To attract new customers to our websites we use a combination of online marketing methods, including social media, paid search, search engine optimization and other web-based marketing methods. We test new online marketing methods on an ongoing basis. Once a customer interacts with us online and elects to receive our e-newsletters and/or promotional emails, we offer ongoing email-based content delivery and promotions. We also use customer data to enable cross-selling of complementary products and services.
 Our Camping World website works in concert with our retail locations and logistics operations, with orders for stocked inventory shipped from the same distribution centers that support our network of retail locations. We currently offer a wide variety of products on www.campingworld.com and associated websites, which include products that are not available in our retail locations. To further support sales, we make use of various affiliate relationships, which helps us reach the RV community across a wide array of websites.
 We continually invest in our network of websites and point of sale technology. Knowing our customers’ purchasing history provides us with the opportunity to have a greater understanding of the wants and needs of our customers. Our websites enable simplified access to all Good Sam content and services in an integrated fashion through www.goodsam.com. Our Retail websites, including www.campingworld.com, www.ganderoutdoors.com, www.overtons.com, www.the-house.com, w82.com, and www.udans.com, feature access to product search and optimized product presentation, as well as shopping and checkout processes. We invest in our websites on an ongoing basis to continually improve our customers’ experience, and to increase visits and purchases by new and returning customers. 
 Customer Service
 We believe customer service and access to a live person is a critical component of our digital marketing and sales operations. Our sales and customer service centers in Englewood, Colorado, and Bowling Green, Kentucky, are multi-channel, full-service contact centers. RV enthusiasts call, email, internet chat and use social media to contact us regarding products, consumer services and protection plans, concerns and anything else related to the RV lifestyle. RV enthusiasts can also speak with our customer service specialists for help with orders, to receive answers to questions and to make purchases for any product offered through our websites.
 Our contact center in Englewood, Colorado is an approximately 230-seat contact center that occupies approximately 20,000 square feet. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Englewood, Colorado contact center handled approximately 2.0 million calls and responded to over 250,000 emails and social media contacts. Our contact center in Bowling Green, Kentucky provides service and support to the Camping World internet and catalog product sales. Our contact center in Greenville, North Carolina has 100+ seats and handled over 230,000 inbound calls in 2018 from outdoor enthusiasts for Gander Outdoors and Overton’s 

 
  24

 
products and services. Our multiple contact center strategy gives us the opportunity to establish redundant systems and cross training. This provides back up in the event of a natural disaster, power outages or weather issues that can affect any individual location, and allows calls to be routed to another contact center to ensure our customer experience stays at a high level.
 Our contact center specialists are extensively trained to assist customers with complex orders and provide a level of service that leads to long-term customer relationships. In addition, our quality assurance team monitors contacts daily and provides the leadership team with tools to maintain sales and service standards. With low turnover, we retain our employees longer than the industry average, which we believe allows our callers to be assisted by experienced contact center agents who are familiar with the RV lifestyle and our services, protection plans and products.
 Management Information Systems
 We utilize sophisticated computer systems to support our operations, including a third-party dealer management system, point-of-sale registers (“POS”), enterprise resource planning system, supply chain management system, CRM, event business management system and marketing database. In addition, we utilize proprietary membership systems and data warehouses to provide analytical views of our data.
 To support the applications, we have multiple data centers with advanced servers, storage and networking capabilities. We have a secure wide area network that facilitates communication within and between our offices and provides both voice and data services. Business critical systems are replicated in real time and all systems are protected with on- and off-site backups.
 A database containing all customer activity across our various businesses and programs has been integrated into our websites and contact centers. Comprehensive information on each customer, including a profile of the purchasing activities, is made available to our CRM, POS and marketing database. We utilize information technology and analytics to actively market and sell multiple products and services to our Active Customers, including list segmentation and merge and purge programs, to select prospects for direct mail solicitations and other direct marketing efforts. We employ publishing software for publication makeup, content and advertising to support our publications operations.
 Our management information systems and electronic data processing systems consist of an extensive range of retail, mail order, financial and merchandising systems, including purchasing, inventory distribution and logistics, sales reporting, accounts payable and merchandise management. Our POS and dealer management systems report comprehensive data in near real time to our data warehouses, including detailed sales volume, inventory information by product, merchandise transfers and receipts, special orders, supply orders and returns of product purchases to vendors. The registers capture Good Sam Club member numbers and associated sales and references to specific promotional campaigns. In conjunction with its nightly polling, our central computer sends price changes to registers at the point of sale. Management monitors the performance of each retail location and mail order operations to evaluate inventory levels, determine markdowns and analyze gross profit margins by product.
 Competition
 We face competition in all of our business segments. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry are breadth and depth of product selection, value pricing, convenient retail locations, technical services and customer service. Our competitors vary in size and breadth of their product offerings. We compete directly or indirectly with the following types of companies:
· | major national insurance and warranty companies, providers of roadside assistance and providers of extended vehicle service contracts;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | other dealers of new and used RVs for sale;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | independent, local specialty stores, such as “mom & pops”;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

· | other large-format outdoor and active sports goods stores and chains, such as Academy Sports + Outdoors, REI, Bass Pro Shops (including Cabela’s) and Sportsman’s Warehouse;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | multi-channel retailers and mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, discount stores, department stores and online retailers, such as Amazon, Target and Wal-Mart;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | other specialty retailers that compete with us across a significant portion of our merchandising categories through retail, catalog or e-commerce businesses, such as Bass Pro Shops (including Cabela’s), Sportsman’s Warehouse and REI; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | online retailers.
--+------------------

  Additional competitors may enter the businesses in which we currently operate. Moreover, some of our mass merchandising competitors do not currently compete in many of the product categories we offer, but may choose to offer a broader array of competing products in the future.
 Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 We own a variety of registered trademarks and service marks related to our brands and our services, protection plans, products and resources, including Good Sam, Camping World, Gander Outdoors and Overton’s.

We do not know of any material pending claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use our intellectual property in the United States or elsewhere. Government Regulation
 Our operations are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local regulation, including our RV sales, firearm sales, vehicle financing, outbound telemarketing, direct mail, roadside assistance programs, extended vehicle service contracts and insurance activities. These laws and regulations include consumer protection laws, so-called “lemon laws,” privacy laws, escheatment laws, anti-money laundering laws and other extensive laws and regulations applicable to new and used vehicle dealers, as well as a variety of other laws and regulations. These laws also include federal and state wage and hour, anti-discrimination and other employment practices laws. Furthermore, new laws and regulations, particularly at the federal level, may be enacted that could also affect our business. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations.” in Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K. Motor Vehicle Laws and Regulations
 Our operations are subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the United States Department of Transportation and the rules and regulations of various state motor vehicle regulatory agencies. We are also subject to federal and numerous state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale, transportation and marketing of motor vehicles, including so-called “lemon laws.” Federal, state and local laws and regulations also impose upon vehicle operators various restrictions on the weight, length and width of motor vehicles that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways. Certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions. Federal and state authorities also have various environmental control standards relating to air, water, noise pollution and hazardous waste generation and disposal.
 Our financing activities with customers are subject to federal truth-in-lending, consumer leasing and equal credit opportunity laws and regulations as well as state and local motor vehicle finance laws, leasing laws, installment finance laws, usury laws and other installment sales and leasing laws and regulations, some of which regulate finance and other fees and charges that may be imposed or received in connection with motor vehicle retail installment sales. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted 

 
  26

 
against us or our retail locations by individuals, a class of individuals, or governmental entities and may expose us to significant damages or other penalties, including revocation or suspension of our licenses to conduct retail operations and fines.
 The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, established the CFPB, an independent federal agency funded by the United States Federal Reserve with broad regulatory powers and limited oversight from the United States Congress. Although automotive dealers are generally excluded, the Dodd-Frank Act could lead to additional, indirect regulation of automotive dealers, in particular, their sale and marketing of finance and insurance products, through its regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions. In March 2013, the CFPB issued supervisory guidance highlighting its concern that the practice of automotive dealers being compensated for arranging customer financing through discretionary markup of wholesale rates offered by financial institutions (“dealer markup”) results in a significant risk of pricing disparity in violation of the ECOA. The CFPB recommended that financial institutions under its jurisdiction take steps to address compliance with the ECOA, which may include imposing controls on dealer markup, monitoring and addressing the effects of dealer markup policies, and eliminating dealer discretion to markup buy rates and fairly compensating dealers using a different mechanism that does not result in disparate impact to certain groups of consumers. 
 Firearms Laws and Regulations
 Regulation and Legislation
 Because we sell firearms at certain of our retail stores, we are subject to regulation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (the “ATF”). Each applicable store has a federal firearms license permitting the sale of firearms, and our applicable distribution centers have obtained federal firearms licenses to store and distribute firearms. Certain states require a state license to sell firearms, and we have obtained these licenses for the states in which we operate that have such a requirement. 
 We must comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, including the National Firearms Act of 1934 (the “NFA”), and the Gun Control Act of 1968 (the “GCA”), all of which have been amended from time to time. The NFA and the GCA require our business to, among other things, maintain federal firearms licenses for our applicable locations and perform a pre-transfer background check in connection with all firearms purchases. We perform this background check using either the FBI-managed National Instant Criminal Background Check System (“NICS”) or, if required by state law, state government-managed system that relies on NICS and any additional information collected by the state. These background check systems either confirm that a transfer can be made, deny the transfer or require that the transfer be delayed for further review, and provide us with a transaction number for the proposed transfer. We are required to record the transaction number on an ATF Form 4473 and retain this form in our records for auditing purposes for 20 years for each approved transfer and five years for each denied or delayed transaction. 
 The federal categories of prohibited purchasers are the prevailing minimum for all states. States (and, in some cases, local governments) on occasion enact laws that further restrict permissible purchasers of firearms. We are also subject to numerous other federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding firearm sale procedures, record keeping, inspection and reporting, including adhering to minimum age restrictions regarding the purchase or possession of firearms or ammunition, residency requirements, applicable waiting periods, importation regulations and regulations pertaining to the shipment and transportation of firearms. 
 Over the past several years, bills have been introduced in the United States Congress that would restrict or prohibit the manufacture, transfer, importation or sale of certain calibers of handgun ammunition, impose a tax and import controls on bullets designed to penetrate bullet-proof vests, impose a special occupational tax and registration requirements on manufacturers of handgun ammunition and increase the tax on handgun ammunition in certain calibers. Recently, Congress has debated certain gun control measures that were supported by the prior administration.
 In September 2004, Congress declined to renew the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 (“AWB”), which prohibited the manufacture of certain firearms defined as “assault weapons”; restricted the sale or possession 

 
  27

 
of “assault weapons,” except those that were manufactured prior to the law’s enactment; and placed restrictions on the sale of new high capacity ammunition feeding devices. Various states and local jurisdictions, including Colorado, Maryland and New York (states in which we operate or plan to operate applicable stores), have adopted their own versions of the AWB or high capacity ammunition feeding device restrictions, some of which restrictions apply to the products we sell in other states. If a statute similar to the AWB were to be enacted or re-enacted at the federal level, it would impact our ability to sell certain products. Additionally, state and local governments have proposed laws and regulations that, if enacted, would place additional restrictions on the manufacture, transfer, sale, purchase, possession and use of firearms, ammunition and shooting-related products. For example, several states, such as Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Washington have enacted laws and regulations that are more restrictive than federal laws and regulations that limit access to and sale of certain firearms. Additionally, Connecticut and New York impose mandatory screening of ammunition purchases; California and the District of Columbia have requirements for microstamping (that is, engraving the handgun’s serial number on each cartridge) of new handguns; and some states prohibit the sale of guns without internal or external locking mechanisms. Other state or local governmental entities may also explore similar legislative or regulatory initiatives that may further restrict the manufacture, sale, purchase, possession or use of firearms, ammunition and shooting-related products. 
 The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which became effective in October 2005, prohibits civil liability actions from being brought or continued in any federal or state court against federally licensed manufacturers, distributors, dealers or importers of firearms or ammunition for damages, punitive damages, injunctive or declaratory relief, abatement, restitution, fines, penalties or other relief resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product by third parties. The legislation does not preclude traditional product liability actions. 
 We are also subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, protection of the environment, human health and safety, advertising, pricing, weights and measures, product safety, and other matters. Some of these laws affect or restrict the manner in which we can sell certain items, such as handguns, smokeless powder, black powder substitutes, ammunition, bows, knives and other products. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the terms of such laws and that we have no liabilities under such laws that we expect could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 Compliance
 We are routinely inspected by the ATF and various state agencies to ensure compliance with federal and local regulations with regards to the manufacture, transfer, importation or sale of firearms and related products. While we view such inspections as a starting point, we employ more thorough internal compliance inspections to help ensure we are in compliance with all applicable laws. We dedicate significant resources to ensure compliance with applicable federal, state and local regulations, including to in-store training and other training materials such as learning management system training modules, training manuals, and standard operating procedures. Our compliance department conducts random internal audits which modeled after those conducted by ATF inspectors. Our staff at retail locations are required to adhere to compliance direction from training materials. We utilize a database and application program to track acquisitions and dispositions of serialized inventory that are designed to meet all federal standards. Additionally, we use an internet-enabled application to assist in completing the federally required records and background checks for firearms. 
 We are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations relating to, among other things, advertising and product restrictions, some of which prohibit or limit the sale, in certain states and locations, of certain items, such as black powder firearms, ammunition, bows, knives, and similar products. Our compliance department administers various restriction codes and other software tools to prevent the sale of such jurisdictionally restricted items.
 Insurance Laws and Regulations
 As a marketer of insurance programs, we are subject to state rules and regulations governing the business of insurance including, without limitation, laws governing the administration, underwriting, marketing, 

 
  28

 
solicitation and/or sale of insurance programs. The insurance carriers that underwrite the programs that we sell are required to file their rates for approval by state regulators. Additionally, certain state laws and regulations govern the form and content of certain disclosures that must be made in connection with the sale, advertising or offer of any insurance program to a consumer. We review all marketing materials we disseminate to the public for compliance with applicable insurance regulations. We are required to maintain certain licenses and approvals in order to market insurance programs.
 Marketing Laws and Regulations
 The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and each of the states have enacted consumer protection statutes designed to ensure that consumers are protected from unfair and deceptive marketing practices. We review all of our marketing materials for compliance with applicable FTC regulations and state marketing laws.
 Our e-commerce business is subject to the Mail or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule and related regulations promulgated by the FTC which affect our catalog mail order operations. FTC regulations, in general, govern the solicitation of orders, the information provided to prospective customers, and the timeliness of shipments and refunds. In addition, the FTC has established guidelines for advertising and labeling many of the products we sell.
 In 2003, the FTC amended its Telemarketing Sales Rule to establish a National “Do Not Call” Registry. As of September 2016, the “Do Not Call” Registry included approximately 226 million phone numbers. To comply with the rule, companies are required to match their call lists against the “Do Not Call” Registry prior to conducting outbound telemarketing and remove the names of consumers who have requested they not be called. In addition, the amended Telemarketing Sales Rule requires additional disclosures and sales practices for goods and services sold over the phone. We match our call lists with the “Do Not Call Registry” and implement telemarketing scripts to comply with this regulation.
 On December 29, 2010, federal legislation entitled the “Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act” was enacted (“ROSCA”). The legislation prohibits the acquisition of consumers’ credit or debit card account numbers automatically from our partners when a consumer enrolls in one of our programs immediately after making a purchase through one of our partners’ websites and requires additional disclosure relating to the online marketing of, and billing for, membership programs in the online post-transaction environment. We have put procedures in place to address compliance with ROSCA.
 Effective October 2011, Florida passed legislation similar to ROSCA, but with some additional requirements, and effective January 2012, Oregon passed legislation regulating free trial offers. The Florida law, like ROSCA, requires that an online post-transaction third-party seller must obtain the express informed consent of the consumer to the sale by obtaining from the consumer the full account number of the account to be charged. The Florida law also requires that online post-transaction third-party sellers must send a written notice confirming the transaction to the consumer by first class U.S. mail or by email. The Oregon legislation prohibits a person from causing a consumer to incur a financial obligation as a result of accepting a free offer unless the person obtains the consumer’s billing information directly from the consumer. We have put procedures in place to address compliance with these laws.
 In addition to the discussion of the Dodd-Frank Act above in connection with our automotive activities, see “— Motor Vehicle Laws and Regulations,” we are also subject to Dodd-Frank Act in connection with our various marketing efforts.
 Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations
 Our operations involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling and/or disposal of materials such as motor oil and filters, transmission fluids, antifreeze, refrigerants, paints, thinners, batteries, cleaning products, lubricants, degreasing agents, tires and propane. Consequently, our business is subject to a complex variety of federal, state and local requirements that regulate the environment and public health and safety.

 Most of our retail locations utilize aboveground storage tanks, and to a lesser extent underground storage tanks, primarily for petroleum-based products. Storage tanks are subject to periodic testing, containment, upgrading and removal requirements under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and its state law counterparts. Clean-up or other remedial action may be necessary in the event of leaks or other discharges from storage tanks or other sources. In addition, water quality protection programs under the federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act), the Safe Drinking Water Act and comparable state and local programs govern certain discharges from some of our operations. Similarly, air emissions from our operations, such as RV painting, are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and related state and local laws. Certain health and safety standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor and related state agencies also apply.
 Although we incur costs to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the ordinary course of our business, we do not presently anticipate that such costs will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We do not have any material known environmental commitments or contingencies.
 Insurance
 We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, product liability, general liability, business interruption, property insurance, director and officers’ liability insurance, environmental, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Where we have retained risk through self-insurance or similar arrangements, we utilize third-party actuarial firms to assist management in assessing the financial impact of risk retention. Our results could be adversely affected by claims and other expenses related to such plans and policies if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 10,724 full-time and 2,222 part-time or seasonal employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe that our employee relations are good. Seasonality
 We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in revenues and net income as a result of annual seasonality in our business. Because RVs are used primarily by vacationers and campers, demand for services, protection plans, products and resources generally declines during the winter season, while sales and profits are generally highest during the spring and summer months. Conversely, we expect demand for non-RV-related outdoor and active sports products to generally decline during the first and second fiscal quarters and we expect sales and profits to generally be higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. In addition, unusually severe weather conditions in some geographic areas may impact demand. On average over the last three years ended December 31, 2018, we generated 30.1% and 28.1% of our annual revenues in the second and third fiscal quarters, respectively, which include the spring and summer months. Additionally, the average quarterly revenue percentage generated over the last three years ended December 31, 2018 from our Consumer Services and Plans segment was 25.1%, 24.6%, 24.2% and 26.1% for the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively, the average quarterly revenue percentage generated over the last three years ended December 31, 2018 from our Dealership segment was 22.3%, 30.7%, 28.2% and 18.8% for the first, second, third and fourth quarters, and the average quarterly revenue percentage generated over the last three years ended December 31, 2018 from our Retail segment was 16.1%, 27.5%, 28.6% and 27.8% for the first, second, third and fourth quarters respectively. We have historically incurred additional expenses in the second and third fiscal quarters due to higher purchase volumes, increased staffing in our Dealership and Retail locations and program costs. For further discussion, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Seasonality” in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K.
