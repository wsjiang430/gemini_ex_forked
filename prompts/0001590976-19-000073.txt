Our Company
We are a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of a diverse range of recreational powerboats, including performance sport boats, sterndrive and outboard boats under four brands—Malibu, Axis, Cobalt, and Pursuit. We have the #1 market share position in the United States in the performance sport boat category through our Malibu and Axis brands and the #1 market share position in the United States in the 24’—29’ segment of the sterndrive category through our Cobalt brand, and we are in a leading position in the fiberglass outboard fishing boat market with our Pursuit brand. Our product portfolio of premium brands are used for a broad range of recreational boating activities including, among others, water sports such as water skiing, wakeboarding and wake surfing, as well as general recreational boating and fishing. Our passion for consistent innovation, which has led to propriety technology such as Surf Gate, has allowed us to expand the market for our products by introducing 
3

consumers to new and exciting recreational activities. We design products that appeal to an expanding range of recreational boaters and water sports enthusiasts whose passion for boating and water sports is a key aspect of their lifestyle and provide consumers with a better customer-inspired experience. With performance, quality, value and multi-purpose features, our product portfolio has us well positioned to broaden our addressable market and achieve our goal of increasing our market share in the expanding recreational boating industry.
Our flagship Malibu boats offer our latest innovations in performance, comfort and convenience, and are designed for consumers seeking a premium performance sport boat experience. We launched our Axis boats in 2009 to appeal to consumers who desire a more affordable performance sport boat product but still demand high performance, functional simplicity and the option to upgrade key features. Our Cobalt boats consist of mid to large-sized luxury cruisers and bowriders that we believe offer the ultimate experience in comfort, performance and quality. Our Pursuit boats expand our product offerings into the saltwater outboard fishing market and includes center console, dual console and offshore models. Retail prices for our boat models range from $60,000 to $800,000.
 Our boats are constructed of fiberglass, available in a range of sizes, hull designs and propulsion systems (i.e., inboard, sterndrive and outboard). We employ experienced product development and engineering teams that enable us to offer a range of models across each of our brands while consistently introducing innovative features in our product offerings. Our engineering teams closely collaborate with our manufacturing personnel in order to improve product quality and process efficiencies. The results of this collaboration are reflected in our receipt of numerous industry awards, including the Boating Industry Magazine's "Top Product" award for the Malibu 25 LSV in 2019, Surf Band in 2018 and for our Integrated Surf Platform ("ISP") in 2016, as well as the Boating Industry's Best New and Innovative Products in 2019 for the Cobalt A29. Malibu has also earned the honors of "WSIA Innovation of Year" award for Malibu Monsoon Engines in 2019 and our Malibu Command Center in 2017. 
We sell our boats through a dealer network that we believe is the strongest in the recreational powerboat industry. As of July 1, 2019, our distribution channel consisted of over 350 dealer locations globally. Our dealer base is an important part of our consumers’ experience, our marketing efforts and our brands. We devote significant time and resources to find, develop and improve the performance of our dealers and believe our dealer network gives us a distinct competitive advantage. 
Financial Information About Segments
We currently report our results of operations under four reportable segments: Malibu U.S., Malibu Australia, Cobalt and Pursuit, based on our boat manufacturing operations. The Malibu U.S. and Malibu Australia segments participate in the manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sale of Malibu and Axis performance sport boats. The Malibu U.S. segment primarily serves markets in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia while the Malibu Australia operating segment principally serves the Australian and New Zealand markets. Our Cobalt segment participates in the manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sale of Cobalt boats throughout the world. Our Pursuit segment participates in the manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sale of Pursuit boats throughout the world. Additional segment information is contained in Note 19 - Segment Reporting, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Market Opportunity
During calendar year 2018, retail sales of new recreational powerboats in the United States totaled $10.7 billion. Of the recreational powerboat categories defined and tracked by the NMMA, we serve the top three categories of outboard, sterndrive and performance sport boat representing an addressable market of nearly $8.9 billion in retail sales through our Malibu, Axis, Cobalt, and Pursuit brands. The following table illustrates the size of our addressable market in units and retail sales for calendar year 2018:

Powerboat Category | Unit Sales | Retail Sales 
 | | (Dollars in millions)
Outboard | 177,600 | | $ | 6,959 
Sterndrive | 11,000 | | 884 | 
Performance sport boat | 10,500 | | 1,096 | 
Jet boat | 5,900 | | 259 | 
Cruisers | 1,900 | | 1,512 | 
Total addressable market | 206,900 | | $ | 10,710

With our acquisition of Pursuit in October 2018, we expanded our available selection of outboard models. We believe the outboard category will continue to be the largest and one of the strongest categories of the recreational powerboat industry, and 
4

that significant opportunity remains for us to enhance our outboard product portfolio and dealer distribution network to capitalize on the outboard category’s performance.
Our Strengths
Leading Market Share Positions. According to SSI, we have held the number one market share position, based on unit volume, in the United States among manufacturers of performance sport boats for each calendar year since 2010 including 2018. We have grown our U.S. market share in this category through our Malibu and Axis brands from 24.5% in 2010 to 31.3% in 2018. Furthermore, we also hold the number one market share position in the 24’—29’ segment of the sterndrive boat category, through our Cobalt brand according to SSI. Cobalt has expanded its market share in this segment from 14.2% in 2010 to 32.3% in 2018. With our Pursuit brand we hold the number two market share position in the offshore boat category for calendar year 2018. Pursuit has expanded its market share in this segment from 17.7% in 2010 to 19.0% in 2018.
Industry-leading Product Design and Innovation. We believe that our innovation in the design of new boat models and new features has been a key to our success, helping us increase our market share within our categories and generally broaden the appeal of our products among recreational boaters. As a result of the features we have introduced, such as our Integrated Surf Platform which includes patented Surf Gate and Power Wedge technology along with Swim Step, our boats can be used for an increasingly wide range of activities. At the same time they are increasingly easier to use, while maintaining the highest level of performance characteristics that consumers expect. Additionally, by introducing new boat models across our portfolio of brands in a range of price points, sizes, bow and hull designs, engine propulsion, and optional performance features, we believe we have enhanced consumers’ ability to select a boat suited to their individual preferences. Our commitment to developing new boat models and introducing new features are reflected in the fact we consistently and successfully bring multiple new model introductions year after year. 
Focus on Vertical Integration Opportunities. We have vertically integrated a number of key components of our manufacturing process, including the manufacturing of boat trailers, towers and tower accessories, machined and billet parts, and tooling. Most recently, we have been engaged in the marinization of our own engines for our Malibu and Axis brands. Vertical integration efforts around engines continue according to plan and we believe we will successfully incorporate our engines in all Malibu and Axis models in fiscal 2020. Vertical integration of key components of our boats gives us the ability to increase incremental margin per boat sold by reducing our cost base and improving the efficiency of our manufacturing process. Additionally, it allows us to have greater control over design, consumer customization options, construction quality, and our supply chain. We believe our engine marinization initiative will reduce our reliance on our previous engine suppliers for our Malibu and Axis brands while reducing the risk that a change in cost or production from any engine supplier for such brands could adversely affect our business. We continually review our manufacturing process to identify opportunities for additional vertical integration investments across our portfolio of premium brands.
Intellectual Property. A key element of our growth and increased market share has been our intellectual property, which we believe is the best in our industry. Among the most innovative and sought after features on our boats has been Surf Gate. Together with Power Wedge and Surf Band, we believe that these patented technologies will continue to drive demand for our products and increase margins across our brands. In fiscal 2018 we acquired Swim Step, through our acquisition of Cobalt which further increases the appeal of our product portfolio. Consequently, there is an increased need to vigorously defend our patents and other intellectual property to ensure we maintain our competitive edge. Because of the appeal of these technologies, we have entered into agreements to license them to other manufacturers within the performance sport boat category. We believe licensing our products provides us with a significant strategic advantage over our competitors by allowing us to expand into other markets and broadening the appeal of these technologies into segments that would not otherwise have them, thereby eventually creating a path to a Malibu purchase.
Strong Dealer Network. We have worked diligently with our dealers to cultivate one of the strongest distribution networks in the recreational powerboat industry. We believe that our distribution network allows us to distribute our products more broadly and effectively than our competitors. We continually review our geographic coverage to identify opportunities for expansion and improvement, and will, where necessary, add dealer locations to address previously underserved markets or replace underperforming dealers.
Highly Recognized Brands. We believe our Malibu, Axis, Cobalt and Pursuit brands are widely recognized in the recreational powerboat industry, which helps us reach a growing number of target consumers. For over 30 years, our Malibu brand has generated a loyal following of recreational boaters and water sports enthusiasts who value the brand’s premium performance and features, while our Axis brand has grown rapidly as consumers have been drawn to its more affordable price point and available optional features. We also acquired two well-known brands in Cobalt and Pursuit. Cobalt has developed into one of the industry’s most recognizable and respected brands over its 50-year history. For over the past 40 years, Pursuit has established a premium brand through its extensive dealer network and longstanding commitment to customers. We build on our 
5

brand recognition and support through a series of marketing initiatives coordinated with our dealers or executed directly by us. Our marketing efforts are conducted using an array of strategies, which include digital advertising, social media engagement, advertisements in endemic media and the sponsorship of grass-roots boating and watersport events. Additionally, our boats, their innovative features, our sponsored athletes and our dealers all frequently win industry awards, which we believe further boosts our brand recognition and reputation for excellence. We believe our marketing strategies and accomplishments enhance our profile in the industry, strengthen our credibility with consumers and dealers, and increase the appeal of our brands.
Diverse Product Offering. We are able to engage consumers across multiple categories within the recreational powerboat industry. Malibu and Axis are market leaders in the performance sport boat category, Cobalt operates in the sterndrive category and has also expanded into wake surfing and outboard product lines, and our most recent acquisition, Pursuit, competes in the saltwater outboard fishing boat market with center console, dual console and offshore models.
Our Strategy 
We intend to capitalize on the recovery in the recreational powerboat industry through the following strategies: 
Continue to Develop New and Innovative Products in Our Categories. We intend to continue developing and introducing new and innovative products—both new boat models to better address a broader range of consumers and new features to deliver better performance, functionality, convenience, comfort and safety to our consumers. We believe that new products and features are important to the growth of our market share, the continued expansion of our categories and our ability to maintain attractive margins.
Our product development strategy consists of a two-pronged approach. First, we seek to introduce new boat models to target unaddressed or underserved segments of the recreational powerboat industry, while also updating and refreshing our existing boat models regularly. Second, we seek to develop and integrate innovative new or enhanced optional feature offerings into our boats. For our Malibu and Axis brands this includes Surf Gate, Malibu Command Center, Power Wedge III, and integrated Swim Step. For Cobalt, it includes launching reverse outboard propulsion models to expand its addressable market. Cobalt has been able to achieve growth in recent years partly by pivoting and expanding into the performance sport boat category through its new Cobalt Surf series, combining new surf features into successful preexisting models. For the Pursuit brand, the focus has been on expanding our award winning Dual Console, Sport and Offshore product offerings that continue to combine innovative features and dependable performance in refined designs that accommodate a broad array of activities on the water. We intend to continue releasing new products and features multiple times during the year, which we believe enhances our reputation as a leading-edge boat manufacturer and provides us with a competitive advantage. 
Further Strengthen Our Dealer Network. Our goal is to achieve and maintain leading market share in each of the categories in which we operate. We continually assess our distribution network and believe we take the actions necessary to achieve our goal. We intend to strengthen our current footprint by selectively recruiting market-leading dealers who currently sell our competitors’ products. In addition, we plan to continue expanding our dealer network in certain geographic areas to increase consumer access and service in strategic markets. We believe our targeted initiatives to enhance and grow our dealer network across all of our brands will increase unit sales in the future.
Continue to Seek Vertical Integration Opportunities. Over the past several years, we have focused on expanding our vertical integration capabilities, having brought in-house the production of towers and tower accessories, trailers, machined and billet parts, and, most recently, producing our own engines for our Malibu and Axis brand boats. Additional vertical integration opportunities exist across our product portfolio and we are aggressively monitoring these opportunities. 
Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. One of our growth strategies is to drive growth in our business through targeted acquisitions that add value while considering our existing brands and product portfolio. We have focused on growth through acquisitions both domestically and abroad, as evidenced by our recent acquisition of Pursuit in October 2018, our acquisition of Cobalt in July 2017 and our acquisition of our Australian licensee in October 2014. The primary objectives of our acquisitions are to expand our presence in new or adjacent categories, to expand into other product lines and business that may benefit from our operating strengths, and to increase the size of our addressable market. When we identify potential acquisitions, we attempt to target companies with a leading market share, strong cash flows, and an experienced management team and workforce that provide a fit with our existing operations. After completing an acquisition, we focus on integrating the company with our existing business to provide additional value to the combined entity through cost savings and revenue synergies, such as the optimization of manufacturing operations, improved processes around product development, enhancement of our existing dealer distribution network, administrative cost savings, shared procurement, vertical integration and cross-selling opportunities.
Accelerate International Expansion. Based on our U.S. leadership position, brand recognition, diverse, innovative product offering and distribution strengths, we believe that we are well-positioned to increase our international sales. We believe we can 
6

increase our international sales both by promoting our products in developed markets where we have a well-established dealer base, such as Western Europe, and by penetrating new and emerging markets where we expect rising consumer incomes to increase demand for recreational products, such as Asia and South America.
Our Products and Brands
We design, manufacture and sell recreational powerboats, including performance sport boats, sterndrive and outboard boats across four world-renowned brands: Malibu, Axis, Cobalt and Pursuit. We believe we deliver superior performance for general recreational purposes with a significant focus on water sports, including wakeboarding, water skiing and wake surfing as well as general recreational boating and fishing. In addition, we also offer various accessories and aftermarket parts. The following

 | | | | • Offshore Series - Our offshore series combines seaworthiness and fishability with the luxury of a cruiser and is designed for the conditions of the open sea and rigged with equipment for offshore fishing trips. 

Innovative Features 
In addition to the standard features included on all of our boats, we offer consumers a full selection of innovative optional features designed to enhance performance, functionality and the overall boating experience. We believe our innovative features drive our high average selling prices. Among our most successful and most innovative has been Surf Gate. Introduced in July 2012 and initially patented in September 2013, Surf Gate is available as an optional feature on all Malibu Wakesetter models and Axis brand boats. Surf Gate has revolutionized the increasingly popular sport of wake surfing. Prior to Surf Gate, boaters 
8

needed to empty ballast tanks on one side of the boat and shift passengers around to lean the boat to create a larger, more pronounced surf-quality wake. By employing precisely engineered and electronically controlled panels, Surf Gate alleviates this time-consuming and cumbersome process, allowing boaters to easily surf behind an evenly weighted boat without the need to wait for ballast changes. For the 2016 model year, we introduced our patented Surf Band technology that allows the rider to control the surf wave, shape, size and side. Some of our other notable innovations include Power Wedge III, G3/GX Tower, Electronic Dashboard Controls, Swim Step, and TrueWave. We won the Boating Industry Magazine's "Top Product" award for the Malibu 25 LSV in 2019, Surf Band in 2018 and for our Integrated Surf Platform ("ISP") in 2016, as well as the Boating Industry's Best New and Innovative Products in 2019 for the new Cobalt A29. Malibu has also earned the honors of "WSIA Innovation of Year" award for Malibu Monsoon Engines in 2019 and our Malibu Command Center in 2017. 
We also offer an array of less technological, but nonetheless value-added boat features such as gelcoat upgrades, upholstery upgrades, engine drivetrain enhancements (such as silent exhaust tips, propeller upgrades and closed cooling engine configuration), sound system upgrades, bimini tops, boat covers and trailers which further increase the level of customization afforded to consumers. 
Our Dealer Network 
We rely on independent dealers to sell our products. We establish performance criteria that our dealers must meet as part of their dealer agreements to ensure our dealer network remains the strongest in the industry. As a member of our network, dealers in North America may qualify for floor plan financing programs, rebates, seasonal discounts, promotional co-op payments and other allowances. In Europe, dealers may qualify for floor plan financing programs. We expect this will strengthen our dealers ability to sell our products in Europe. We believe our dealer network is the most extensive in the market. 
North America 
As of July 1, 2019, our dealer network consisted of over 250 dealer locations servicing the performance sport boat, sterndrive, and outboard markets strategically located throughout the U.S. and Canada. Approximately 50% of our dealer locations have been with us, or with Cobalt and Pursuit prior to our acquisition of them, for over ten years. For fiscal year 2019, our top ten dealers on a consolidated basis accounted for approximately 38% of our total units sold.  The top ten dealers for each of Malibu U.S., Cobalt and Pursuit represented approximately 50%, 49% and 83%, respectively, of units sold in fiscal year 2019. The top ten dealers for each segment are not the same across all segments. Sales to our dealers under common control of OneWater Marine, Inc. represented approximately 15% of consolidated net sales in fiscal year 2019, including approximately 8%, 16% and 33% of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2019 for Malibu U.S., Cobalt and Pursuit, respectively.
We consistently review our distribution network to identify opportunities to expand our geographic footprint and improve our coverage of the market. We believe that our diverse product offering and strong market position in each region of the United States helped us capitalize on growth opportunities as our industry recovered from the economic downturn. We have the ability to opportunistically add new dealers and new dealer locations to previously underserved markets and use data and performance metrics to monitor dealer performance. We believe our outstanding dealer network allows us to distribute our products more efficiently than our competitors.
International
We have an extensive international distribution network for our Malibu, Axis, Cobalt and Pursuit brands. As of July 1, 2019, our dealer network consisted of over 100 dealer locations throughout Europe, Asia, Middle East, South America, South Africa, and Australia/New Zealand. We service our independent dealers in the Australian and New Zealand markets who sell our Malibu and Axis brand boats through our Australian operations acquired in October 2014. 
Dealer Management 
Our relationship with our dealers is governed through dealer agreements. Each dealer agreement has a finite term lasting between one and three years. Our dealer agreements also are typically terminable without cause by the dealer with 60 days’ prior notice and by us for a dealer failing to meet performance criteria. We may also generally terminate these agreements immediately for cause upon certain events. Pursuant to our dealer agreements, the dealers typically agree to, among other things: 

• | represent our products at specified boat shows;


• | market our products only to retail end users in a specific geographic territory;


• | promote and demonstrate our products to consumers;

9


• | place a specified minimum number of orders of our products during the term of the agreement in exchange for rebate or discount eligibility that varies according to the level of volume they commit to purchase;


• | provide us with regular updates regarding the number and type of our products in their inventory;


• | maintain a service department to service our products, and perform all appropriate warranty service and repairs; and


• | indemnify us for certain claims.

Our dealer network, including all additions, renewals, non-renewals or terminations, is managed by our sales personnel. Our sales teams operate using a semi-annual dealer review process involving our senior management team. Each individual dealer is reviewed semi-annually with a broad assessment across multiple key elements, including the dealer’s geographic region, market share and customer service ratings, to identify underperforming dealers for remediation and to manage the transition process when non-renewal or termination is a necessary step. 
We have developed a system of financial incentives for our dealers based on customer satisfaction and achievement of best practices. Our brands employ dealer incentive programs that have been refined through decades of experience at each brand and may, from time to time, include the following elements:

• | Rebates and Discounts. Our domestic dealers agree to volume commitments that are used to determine applicable rebates or discounts. The structure of the dealer incentive depends on the brand represented. If a dealer meets its volume commitments as well as other terms of the dealer performance program, the dealer is entitled to the specified amounts subject to full compliance with our programs. Failure to meet the commitment volume or other terms of the program may result in partial or complete forfeiture of the dealer’s rebate or discount.


• | Co-op. Dealers of the Malibu, Axis and Pursuit product line may earn certain co-op reimbursements upon reaching a specified level of qualifying expenditures.


• | Free flooring. Our dealers that take delivery of current model year boats in the offseason, typically July through April, are entitled to have us pay the interest to floor the boat until the earlier of (1) the retail sale of the unit or (2) a date near the end of the current model year. This program is an additional incentive to encourage dealers to order in the offseason and helps us balance our seasonal production.

Our dealer incentive programs are structured to promote more evenly distributed ordering throughout the fiscal year, which allows us to achieve better level-loading of our production and thereby generate plant operating efficiencies. In addition, these programs may offer further rewards for dealers who are exclusive to our brands. 
Floor Plan Financing
Our North American dealers often purchase boats through floor plan financing programs with third-party floor plan financing providers. During fiscal year 2019, approximately 85% of our North American shipments were made pursuant to floor plan financing programs through which our dealers participate. These programs allow dealers across our brands to establish lines of credit with third-party lenders to purchase inventory. Under these programs, a dealer draws on the floor plan facility upon the purchase of our boats and the lender pays the invoice price of the boats. As is typical in our industry, we have entered into repurchase agreements with certain floor plan financing providers to our dealers. Under the terms of these arrangements, in the event a lender repossesses a boat from a dealer that has defaulted on its floor financing arrangement and is able to deliver the repossessed boat to us, we are obligated to repurchase the boat from the lender. Our obligation to repurchase such repossessed products for the unpaid balance of our original invoice price for the boat is subject to reduction or limitation based on the age and condition of the boat at the time of repurchase, and in certain cases by an aggregate cap on repurchase obligations associated with a particular floor financing program. 
Our exposure under repurchase agreements with third-party lenders is mitigated by our ability to reposition inventory with a new dealer in the event that a repurchase event occurs. The primary cost to us of a repurchase event is any margin loss on the resale of a repurchased unit. Historically, we have been able to resell repurchased boats at an amount that exceeds our cost. In addition, the historical margin loss on the resale of repurchased units has often been below 10% of the repurchased amount. For fiscal year 2019, we agreed to accept a return associated with the repurchase of eight units from the lender of two of our former dealers. In fiscal year 2020 these boats were resold above their cost and at minimal margin loss. For fiscal year 2018 and 2017, we did not repurchase any boats under our repurchase agreements.

Marketing and Sales
We believe that providing a high level of service to our dealers and end consumers is essential to maintaining our reputation. Our sales personnel receive training on the latest Malibu, Axis, Cobalt, and Pursuit products and technologies, as well as training on our competitors’ products and technologies, and attend trade shows to increase their market knowledge. This training is then passed along to our dealers to ensure a consistent marketing message and leverage our marketing expenditures. Malibu, Axis, Cobalt and Pursuit enjoy strong brand awareness, as evidenced by our substantial market share in their respective categories. 
Our marketing strategy focuses on strengthening and promoting Malibu and Axis brands in the performance sport boat marketplace and the Cobalt and Pursuit brands in the outboard and sterndrive marketplaces. In addition to the Malibu, Axis, Cobalt, and Pursuit websites and traditional marketing channels such as print advertising and tradeshows, we maintain an active digital advertising and social media platform for all brands, including use of Facebook and Twitter to increase brand awareness, foster loyalty and build a community of users. In addition, we benefit from various Cobalt, Malibu, Axis, and Pursuit user-generated videos and photos that are uploaded to websites including YouTube, Vimeo and Instagram. 
Product Development and Engineering
We are strategically and financially committed to innovation, as reflected in our dedicated product development and engineering teams located in Tennessee, Kansas, California, and Florida and evidenced by our track record of new product introduction. These individuals bring to our product development efforts significant expertise across core disciplines, including boat design, trailer design, computer-aided design, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. They are responsible for execution of all facets of our new product strategy, including designing new and refreshed boat models and new features, engineering these designs for manufacturing and integrating new features into our boats. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer are actively involved in the product development process and integration into manufacturing. 
We take a disciplined approach to the management of our product development strategy. We use a formalized phase gate process, overseen by a dedicated project manager, to develop, evaluate and implement new product ideas for both boat models and innovative features. Application of the phase gate process requires management to establish an overall timeline that is sub-divided into milestones, or “gates,” for product development. Setting milestones at certain intervals in the product development process ensures that each phase of development occurs in an organized manner and enables management to become aware of and address any issues in timely fashion, which facilitates on-time, on-target release of new products with expected return on investment. Extensive testing and coordination with our manufacturing group are important elements of our product development process, which we believe enable us to minimize the risk associated with the release of new products. Our phase gate process also facilitates our introduction of new boat models and features throughout the year, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Finally, in addition to our process for managing new product introductions in a given fiscal year, we also engage in longer-term product life cycle and product portfolio planning. 
Manufacturing
Malibu has five manufacturing facilities located in four U.S. states and Australia. We produce performance sport boats through our Malibu and Axis brands at our Tennessee and Australia manufacturing facilities and sterndrive and outboard boats through our Cobalt brand at our Kansas manufacturing facility and our Pursuit brand in Fort Pierce, Florida. We plan to expand our facilities in Kansas and Florida over the next few years. For our Malibu and Axis brands, we manufacture towers, tower accessories and stainless steel and aluminum billet at our California facility and engines and trailers at our Tennessee facility.
Our boats are built through a continuous flow manufacturing process that encompasses fabrication, assembly, quality management and testing. Each boat is produced on an established cycle depending on model that includes the fabrication of the hull and deck through gelcoat application and fiberglass lamination, grinding and hole cutting, installation of components, rigging, finishing, detailing and on-the-water testing. Production of cruisers occurs on a dedicated line that allows for the increased time needed to add the additional content required for production of larger boats. Trailers are also produced in a continuous flow manufacturing process involving cutting and bending of the main frame from raw top grade carbon steel, painting using our state of the art system and installation of components. We manufacture certain components and subassemblies for our boats, such as upholstery, stainless steel and aluminum billet and towers. We procure other components, such as electronic controls, from third-party vendors and install them on the boat. As noted elsewhere, we are marinizing our own engines for our Malibu and Axis brands. Our tower-related manufacturing in California uses multiple computer-controlled machines to cut all of the aluminum parts required for tower assembly. We are the only performance sport boat company that manufacturers towers in-house. We believe that the vertical integration of these components is a distinct competitive advantage that allows us to control key design elements of our boats and generate higher margins.
11

We are committed to continuous improvement in our operations, and we believe our efforts in this regard have resulted in higher gross margins. Specifically, we have increased labor efficiency and reduced cost of materials. Our production engineers evaluate and seek to optimize the configuration of our production line given our production volumes and model mix. We use disciplined mold maintenance procedures to maintain the usable life of our molds and to reduce surface defects that would require rework. We have instituted scrap material reduction and recovery processes, both internally and with our supplier base, helping to manage our material costs. Finally, we have implemented a quality management system to ensure that proper procedures and control measures are in place to deliver consistent, high-quality product, especially as our production volumes have increased. 
Suppliers 
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from our supplier base, including resins, fiberglass, hydrocarbon feedstocks and steel, as well as product parts and components, such as engines and electronic controls, through a sales order process. The most significant component used in manufacturing our boats, based on cost, are engines. Through our vertical integration initiative to marinize our own engines, we entered into an engine supply agreement with General Motors LLC (“General Motors”) in November 2016 for the supply of engine blocks to use in our Malibu and Axis brand boats which began in our model year 2019 and will continue through model year 2023. We adopted this strategy in order to more directly control product path (design, innovation, calibration and integration) of our largest dollar procured part, to differentiate our product from our competitors, and to increase our ability to respond to ongoing changes in the marketplace.
Pursuant to the engine supply agreement, we will submit purchase orders for engines to General Motors and, so long as we are not in breach of the engine supply agreement, General Motors will deliver engines pursuant to the purchase orders. No minimum amount of engines is required to be ordered by us and the parties must discuss any potential capacity increases above 7,000 engines annually. 
The engine supply agreement will expire on November 14, 2023, unless terminated earlier by either party as permitted under the terms of the agreement. General Motors may terminate the engine supply agreement due to market conditions with at least eighteen (18) months’ advanced written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement as a result of a change of control of Malibu Boats, Inc., as defined in the agreement, with at least eighteen (18) months’ advanced written notice. Either party may also terminate the engine supply agreement due to breach of the other party upon written notice and after providing 60 days to cure any breach. General Motors may also suspend engine deliveries to Malibu Boats in the event of a force majeure, as defined in the engine supply agreement.
General Motors will provide up to a one-year warranty on the engines supplied to us and we have agreed to indemnify General Motors for claims and costs arising from or relating to the engines resulting from our actions.
In August 2018, in connection with our acquisition of Pursuit, we entered into an agreement with Yamaha Motor Corporation, U.S.A., or Yamaha. Under our agreement with Yamaha, we have agreed to purchase Yamaha outboard engines for use in at least 90% of all Pursuit and Cobalt branded boats that are pre-equipped with outboard motors when sold by us. We must pay damages to Yamaha if we do not achieve pre-approved purchase volume targets for each year of the agreement and for the entire term of the agreement, which is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2023, unless renewed by both parties. We have not paid any damages to Yamaha through June 30, 2019. 
 We have not experienced any material shortages in any of our raw materials, product parts or components. Temporary shortages, when they do occur, usually involve manufacturers of these products adjusting model mixes, introducing new product lines or limiting production in response to an industry-wide reduction in boat demand. 
Insurance and Product Warranties 
We carry various insurance policies, including policies to cover general products liability, workers’ compensation and other casualty and property risks, to protect against certain risks of loss consistent with the exposures associated with the nature and scope of our operations. Our policies are generally based on our safety record as well as market trends in the insurance industry and are subject to certain deductibles, limits and policy terms and conditions. 
Our Malibu and Axis brands have a limited warranty for a period up to five years. Prior to fiscal year 2016, we provided a limited warranty for a period of up to three years for our Malibu brand boats and two years for our Axis boats. For our Cobalt brand boats, we provide a structural warranty of up to ten years which covers hull/deck joints, bulkheads, floor, transom, stringers, and motor mount. In addition, we provide a five year bow-to-stern warranty on all components manufactured or purchased (excluding hull and deck structural components), including canvas and upholstery. Gelcoat is covered up to three years for Cobalt and one year for Malibu and Axis. For Pursuit boats, we provide a limited warranty for a period of up to five years on structural components such as the hull, deck and defects in the gelcoat surface of the hull bottom. Some materials, 
12

components or parts of the boat that are not covered by our limited product warranties are separately warranted by their manufacturers or suppliers. These other warranties include warranties covering engines purchased from suppliers and other components. We provide for a limited warranty of up to five years or five-hundred hours on engines that we manufacture for our Malibu and Axis models.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and copyright protection, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our rights in our brand, products and proprietary technology. This is an important part of our business and we intend to continue protecting our intellectual property. We currently hold 26 U.S. patents, four Australian patents, and five pending U.S. patent applications. We also acquired seven U.S. patents, two U.S. patent applications, and two foreign applications in connection with our acquisition of Pursuit Boats.
We own 37 registered trademarks in various countries around the world, including 18 valid trademarks for Malibu in the U.S., five valid trademarks for Malibu in Australia and eight valid trademarks for Malibu in Canada.  We also own four U.S. trademarks for Cobalt and two U.S. trademarks for Pursuit. Such trademarks may endure in perpetuity on a country-by-country basis, provided that we comply with all statutory maintenance requirements, including continued use of each trademark in each such country. We also have 16 pending trademarks in the U.S., Canada, and Australia.  We currently do not own any registered copyrights.
Competition 
The recreational powerboat industry, including the performance sport boat, sterndrive and outboard categories, is highly competitive for consumers and dealers. Competition affects our ability to succeed in the markets we currently serve and new markets that we may enter in the future. We compete with several large manufacturers that may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. We compete with large manufacturers who are represented by dealers in the markets in which we now operate and into which we plan to expand. We also compete with a wide variety of small, independent manufacturers. Competition in our industry is based primarily on brand name, price and product performance. 
Environmental, Safety and Regulatory Matters 
Our operations and products are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation under various federal, commonwealth, state, and local statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations in the United States and Australia where we manufacture our boats, and in other foreign jurisdictions where we sell our products. We believe we are in material compliance with those requirements. However, we cannot be certain that costs and expenses required for us to comply with such requirements in the future, including for any new or modified regulatory requirements, or to address newly discovered environmental conditions, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flow. The regulatory programs to which we are subject include the following:
Hazardous Materials and Waste
Certain materials used in our manufacturing, including the resins used in production of our boats, are toxic, flammable, corrosive or reactive and are classified as hazardous materials by the national, state and local governments in those jurisdictions where we manufacture our products. The handling, storage, release, treatment and recycling or disposal of these substances and wastes from our operations are regulated in the United States by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“USEPA”), and state and local environmental agencies. The handling, storage, release, treatment and recycling or disposal of these substances and wastes from our operations are regulated in Australia by the Australian Department of Environment and Energy, the New South Wales Environmental Protection Agency and other state and local authorities. Failure by us to properly handle, store, release, treat, recycle or dispose of our hazardous materials and wastes could result in liability for us, including fines, penalties, or obligations to investigate and remediate any contamination originating from our operations or facilities. We are not aware of any material contamination at our current or former facilities for which we could be liable under environmental laws or regulations, and we currently are not undertaking any remediation or investigation activities in connection with any contamination. Future spills or accidents or the discovery of currently unknown conditions or non-compliance could, however, could give rise to investigation and remediation obligations or related liabilities.
Air Quality
In the United States, the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and corresponding state and local laws and rules regulate emissions of air pollutants. Because our manufacturing operations involve molding and coating of fiberglass materials, which involves the emission of certain volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants, and particulate matter, we are required to maintain and comply with a CAA operating permit (Title V permit) for our Tennessee, Kansas and Florida facilities and local 
13

air permits for our California facilities. Our air permits generally require us to monitor our emissions and periodically certify that our emissions are within specified limits. To date, we have not had material difficulty complying with those limits. 
The USEPA and the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) have adopted regulations stipulating that many marine propulsion engines and watercraft meet certain air emission standards. Some of these standards require fitting a catalytic converter to the engine. These regulations also require, among other things, that engine manufacturers provide a warranty that their engines meet USEPA and CARB emission standards. The engines used in our products are subject to these regulations. CARB also recently adopted an evaporative emissions regulation that applies to all spark-ignition marine watercraft with permanently installed fuel tanks sold in California.  This regulation will apply to our boats beginning with model year 2019. The new regulation requires subject boat manufacturers to use specific CARB-certified components for the fuel systems in their boats, or to certify the boat meets a related performance standard. The USEPA and CARB emissions regulations have increased the cost to manufacture our products.
OSHA 
In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) standards limit the amount of emissions to which an employee may be exposed without the need for respiratory protection or upgraded plant ventilation. Our facilities are regularly inspected by OSHA and by state and local inspection agencies and departments. We believe that our facilities comply in all material aspects with these regulations. Although capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws are expected to increase, we do not currently anticipate any material expenditure will be required to continue to comply with existing OSHA environmental or safety regulations in connection with our existing manufacturing facilities.
At our New South Wales, Australia (“NSW”) facility, employee health and safety is regulated by SafeWork NSW, which also has requirements that limit the amount of certain emissions to which an employee may be exposed without the need for respiratory protection or upgraded plant ventilation. In addition, SafeWork NSW provides licensing and registration for potentially dangerous work, investigates workplace incidents, and enforces work health and safety laws in NSW. Our NSW facilities are routinely inspected by SafeWork NSW. We believe that our facilities comply in all material aspects with these requirements.
Boat Design and Manufacturing Standards
Powerboats sold in the United States must be manufactured to meet the standards of certification required by the United States Coast Guard. In addition, boats manufactured for sale in the European Community must be certified to meet the European Community’s imported manufactured products standards. These certifications specify standards for the design and construction of powerboats. We believe that all of our boats meet these standards. In addition, safety of recreational boats in the United States is subject to federal regulation under the Boat Safety Act of 1971, which requires boat manufacturers to recall products for replacement of parts or components that have demonstrated defects affecting safety. We have instituted recalls for defective component parts produced by certain of our third-party suppliers, including a recent recall on our fuel pumps supplied by a third party. None of our recalls have had a material adverse impact on us.
Employees 
As of July 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we had approximately 1,835, 1,345 and 1,240 employees worldwide, respectively. None of our employees are party to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Organizational Structure
Malibu Boats, Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on November 1, 2013 in anticipation of our IPO to serve as a holding company that owns only an interest in Malibu Boats Holdings, LLC. Immediately after the completion of our IPO and the recapitalization we completed in connection with our IPO, Malibu Boats, Inc. held approximately 49.3% of the economic interest in the LLC, which has since increased to approximately 96.2% of the economic interest in the LLC as of June 30, 2019. 
The certificate of incorporation of Malibu Boats, Inc. authorizes two classes of common stock, Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Holders of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock have voting power over Malibu Boats, Inc., the sole managing member of the LLC, at a level that is consistent with their overall equity ownership of our business. In connection with our IPO and the recapitalization we completed in connection with our IPO, Malibu Boats, Inc. issued to each pre-IPO owner, for nominal consideration, one share of Class B Common Stock of Malibu Boats, Inc., each of which provides its owner with no economic rights but entitles the holder to one vote on matters presented to stockholders of Malibu Boats, Inc. for each LLC Unit held by such holder. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each share 
14

of Class A Common Stock entitles the holder to one vote with respect to each matter presented to our stockholders on which the holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to vote. Each holder of Class B Common Stock is entitled to the number of votes equal to the total number of LLC units held by such holder multiplied by the exchange rate specified in the exchange agreement with respect to each matter presented to our stockholders on which the holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to vote. Accordingly, the holders of LLC Units collectively have a number of votes that is equal to the aggregate number of LLC Units that they hold. As the LLC members sell LLC Units to us or subsequently exchange LLC Units for shares of Class A Common Stock of Malibu Boats, Inc. pursuant to the exchange agreement described below, the voting power afforded to them by their shares of Class B Common Stock is automatically and correspondingly reduced. Subject to any rights that may be applicable to any then outstanding preferred stock, our Class A and Class B Common Stock vote as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise provided in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or required by applicable law. In addition, subject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of our Class A Common Stock are entitled to share equally, identically and ratably in any dividends or distributions (including in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs) that our board of directors may determine to issue from time to time, while holders of our Class B Common Stock do not have any right to receive dividends or other distributions. 
As noted above, Malibu Boats, Inc. is a holding company with a controlling equity interest in the LLC. Malibu Boats, Inc., as sole managing member of the LLC, operates and controls all of the business and affairs and consolidates the financial results of the LLC. The limited liability company agreement of the LLC provides that it may be amended, supplemented, waived or modified by the written consent of Malibu Boats, Inc., as managing member of the LLC, in its sole discretion without the approval of any other holder of LLC Units, except that no amendment may materially and adversely affect the rights of a holder of LLC Units, other than on a pro rata basis with other holders of LLC Units, without the consent of such holder (unless more than one holder is so affected, then the consent of a majority of such affected holders is required). Pursuant to the limited liability company agreement of the LLC, Malibu Boats, Inc. has the right to determine when distributions (other than tax distributions) will be made to the members of the LLC and the amount of any such distributions. If Malibu Boats, Inc. authorizes a distribution, such distribution will be made to the members of the LLC (including Malibu Boats, Inc.) pro rata in accordance with the percentages of their respective LLC Units.
The diagram below depicts our current organizational structure, as of June 30, 2019:
15

Our organizational structure allows the LLC members to retain their equity ownership in the LLC, an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in the form of LLC Units. Holders of Class A Common Stock, by contrast, hold their equity ownership in Malibu Boats, Inc., a Delaware corporation that is a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in the form of shares of Class A Common Stock. The holders of LLC Units, including Malibu Boats, Inc., will incur U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on their proportionate share of any taxable income of the LLC. Net profits and net losses of the LLC will generally be allocated to the LLC’s members (including Malibu Boats, Inc.) pro rata in accordance with the percentages of their respective limited liability company interests. The limited liability company agreement provides for cash distributions to the holders of LLC Units if Malibu Boats, Inc. determines that the taxable income of the LLC will give rise to taxable income for its members. In accordance with the limited liability company agreement, we intend to cause the LLC to make cash distributions to the holders of LLC Units for purposes of funding their tax obligations in respect of the income of the LLC that is allocated to them. Generally, these tax distributions will be computed based on our estimate of the taxable income of the LLC allocable to such holder of LLC Units multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest effective marginal combined U.S. federal, state and local income tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporate resident in Los Angeles, California (taking into account the nondeductibility of certain expenses and the character of our income). For purposes of determining the taxable income of the LLC, such determination will be made by generally disregarding any adjustment to the taxable income of any member of the LLC that arises under the tax basis adjustment rules of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code and is attributable to the acquisition by such member of an interest in the LLC in a sale or exchange transaction. 
Exchanges and Other Transactions with Holders of LLC Units
In connection with our IPO and the recapitalization we completed in connection with our IPO, we entered into an exchange agreement with the pre-IPO owners of the LLC under which (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement) each pre-IPO 
16

owner (or its permitted transferee) has the right to exchange its LLC Units for shares of our Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications, or, at our option, except in the event of a change in control, for a cash payment equal to the market value of the Class A Common Stock. The exchange agreement provides, however, that such exchanges must be for a minimum of the lesser of 1,000 LLC Units, all of the LLC Units held by the holder, or such amount as we determine to be acceptable. The exchange agreement also provides that an LLC member will not have the right to exchange LLC Units if Malibu Boats, Inc. determines that such exchange would be prohibited by law or regulation or would violate other agreements with Malibu Boats, Inc. to which the LLC member may be subject or any of our written policies related to unlawful or insider trading. The exchange agreement also provides that Malibu Boats, Inc. may impose additional restrictions on exchanges that it determines to be necessary or advisable so that the LLC is not treated as a “publicly traded partnership” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, pursuant to the limited liability company agreement of the LLC, Malibu Boats, Inc., as managing member of the LLC, has the right to require all members of the LLC to exchange their LLC Units for Class A Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the exchange agreement, subject to the consent of the holders of a majority of outstanding LLC Units other than those held by Malibu Boats, Inc.
As a result of exchanges of LLC Units into Class A Common Stock and purchases by Malibu Boats, Inc. of LLC Units from holders of LLC Units, Malibu Boats, Inc. will become entitled to a proportionate share of the existing tax basis of the assets of the LLC at the time of such exchanges or purchases. In addition, such exchanges and purchases of LLC Units are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the assets of the LLC that otherwise would not have been available. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amount of tax that Malibu Boats, Inc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future. These increases in tax basis may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the pre-IPO owners (or their permitted assignees) that provides for the payment by Malibu Boats, Inc. to the pre-IPO owners (or their permitted assignees) of 85% of the amount of the benefits, if any, that Malibu Boats, Inc. is deemed to realize as a result of (1) increases in tax basis and (2) certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. These payment obligations are obligations of Malibu Boats, Inc. and not of the LLC.
