include industrial components, commercial aerospace, energy, and telecommunications infrastructure. Direct competitors include American Beryllia Inc., CBL Ceramics Limited, and CoorsTek, Inc. 

• | Beryllium hydroxide is produced at our milling operations in Utah from our bertrandite ore mine and purchased beryl ore. The hydroxide is used primarily as a raw material input for strip and bulk products and, to a lesser extent, beryllium products.

PAC's products are primarily sold directly from its facilities throughout the United States, Asia, and Europe, as well as distributed internationally through a network of company-owned service centers, outside distributors, and agents. 
Advanced Materials
Advanced Materials produces advanced chemicals, microelectronics packaging, precious metal, non-precious metal, and specialty metal products, including vapor deposition targets, frame lid assemblies, clad and precious metal pre-forms, high temperature braze materials, and ultra-pure wire. These products are used in semiconductor logic and memory, medical, energy, lighting, defense, optics, and wireless communications applications within the consumer electronics, industrial components, and telecommunications infrastructure end markets. Advanced Materials also has metal recovery operations and in-house refining that allow for the recycling of precious metals.
Advanced Materials products are sold directly from its facilities throughout the United States, Asia, and Europe, as well as through direct sales offices and independent sales representatives throughout the world. Principal competition includes companies such as Honeywell International, Inc., Praxair, Inc., Solar Applied Materials Technology Corp., Grikin, Solaris, Ametek Electronic Components and Packaging, Sumitomo Metals Industries, Ltd., and Tanaka Holding Co., Ltd., as well as a number of smaller regional and national suppliers.
The majority of the sales into the consumer electronics end market from this segment are vapor deposition targets, lids, wire, other related precious and non-precious metal products, and advanced chemicals for semiconductors and other microelectronic applications. These materials are used in wireless, light-emitting diode (LED), handheld devices and other applications, as well as in a number of applications within the defense end market. Since we are an up-front material supplier, changes in our consumer electronics sales levels do not necessarily correspond to changes in the end-use consumer demand in the same period due to down-stream inventory positions, the time to develop and deploy new products, and manufacturing lead times and scheduling. While our product and market development efforts allow us to capture new applications, we may lose existing applications and customers from time to time due to the rapid change in technologies and other factors.

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales for 2018. 
Availability of Raw Materials
The principal raw materials we use are aluminum, beryllium, cobalt, copper, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, silver, and tin. Ore reserve data can be found in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The availability of these raw materials, as well as other materials used by us, is adequate and generally not dependent on any one supplier.
Patents and Licenses
We own patents, patent applications, and licenses relating to certain of our products and processes. While our rights under these patents and licenses are of some importance to our operations, our business is not materially dependent on any one patent or license or on all of our patents and licenses as a group.
Backlog
The backlog of unshipped orders as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $266.0 million, $204.0 million, and $175.5 million, respectively. Backlog is generally represented by purchase orders that may be terminated under certain conditions. We expect that substantially all of our backlog of orders at December 31, 2018 will be filled over the next 18 months.
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to a variety of laws that regulate the manufacturing, processing, use, handling, storage, transport, treatment, emission, release, and disposal of substances and wastes used or generated in manufacturing. For decades, we have operated our facilities under applicable standards of inplant and outplant emissions and releases. The inhalation of airborne beryllium particulate may present a health hazard to certain individuals.
On January 9, 2017, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) published a new standard for workplace exposure to beryllium that, among other things, lowered the permissible exposure by a factor of ten and established new requirements for respiratory protection, personal protective clothing and equipment, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and record keeping. On July 6, 2018, OSHA issued a Direct Final Rule that amended the text of the new standard to clarify OSHA’s intent with respect to certain terms and provisions of the standard, and on December 11, 2018, OSHA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning additional modifications to the standard “to clarify certain provisions and to simplify or improve compliance.” Other government and standard-setting organizations are also reviewing beryllium-related worker safety rules and standards, and will likely make them more stringent. The development, proposal, or adoption of more stringent standards may affect the buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards, the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of any reduction in customer use, and other factors. The magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated.
