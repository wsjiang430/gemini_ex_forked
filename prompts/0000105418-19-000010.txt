 In 2016, Weis Markets acquired five Mars Super Market locations in Baltimore County, MD, 38 Food Lion stores throughout Maryland, Virginia and Delaware, and a Nell's Family Market in East Berlin, PA.  The completion of these individual acquisitions expanded the Company's footprint into Virginia and Delaware, and increased its store count by 25 percent.  Beginning August 1, 2016, the Company converted the 44 stores to Weis Markets stores in 96 days ending in November, during which it interviewed and hired more than 2,000 associates who were previously employed at the acquired locations.  In 2018, the acquired store group is providing a positive cash flow for the Company as management continues to develop the stores using its business model.  During 2018, the Company closed two of the former Food Lion stores at the end of the committed lease term.  Although there are no pending acquisitions, the Company continues to investigate acquisition opportunities as well as grow its existing store base organically.

 The Company believes that opening new stores and remodeling current stores are vital for future Company growth.  The location and appearance of its stores are important components of attracting new and retaining current customers.  On an average basis, the Company has five to eight new stores in the process of being developed and dedicates a quarter of its capital budget to new stores annually, excluding acquisitions.  Generally, another fifteen to twenty percent of the capital budget is dedicated to store remodels while the remainder is attributable to smaller in-store sales-driven projects, store maintenance and store support function expenditures.  See the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section included in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more details regarding the Company’s capital expenditures.
