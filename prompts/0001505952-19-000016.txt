Item 1. Business
Overview 
Domo is an operating system that powers a business, enabling all employees, from the CEO to front-line workers, to access real-time data and insights and take action from their smartphone. This is possible because Domo digitally connects all the people, data and systems in an organization. 
Through Domo’s platform, data from across the business is collected, stored, prepared, organized, analyzed, visualized, and shared. Algorithms and machine learning can be applied to the data that allow alerts to be triggered and actions invited. Users can receive these notifications on any device and immediately act on the invitation, after which the system can write back to the original system of record. Because Domo can digitally connect any organization and empower each of its employees, we believe our market potential is every working person with a mobile device. Because we leverage the power of the cloud, our platform can process extremely large volumes of quantitative and qualitative data while maintaining high performance levels. On a typical business day, our customers in the aggregate typically query several hundred trillion rows from uncached queries. Even with this volume of data, we maintain a subsecond average query response time. In aggregate, the data in Domo can be indexed anonymously. 
We have made significant investments to build an enterprise-grade platform with the scale, speed and security to support the world's largest organizations, regardless of where they are in their digital transformation journey. In many ways, building Domo was like building seven start-ups in one. We built connectors to connect real-time to all of the data within a company and bring all that data into a warehouse and developed a data engine that is able to manage up to trillions of rows of data. We built visualization tools that enable our users to explore the data on any device and enable them to collaborate on the data in real time. We built our artificial intelligence and machine learning engine that is able to find correlations within the data and invites users to action. To enable our users to develop the applications they wanted on top of this platform, we built an app store with pre-built applications as well as the tools for users to build their own applications. That's why Domo is more than just a business intelligence, data warehouse, data discovery, analytics, collaboration, dashboarding, visualization or reporting tool. These tools and technologies are typically provided by separate vendors today. Domo combines all of them in a single platform that can augment a customer's existing infrastructure with the following: 

• | Connectors: Domo offers more than 1,000 powerful, first-class connectors which we define as read/write, API and standards based connectors that are available in the Domo Appstore, as well as a library of very flexible universal connectors that currently power over one hundred thousand Domo datasets, enabling all users, regardless of technical ability, to connect to data across a broad range of sources and facilitate initiation of business processes. These connectors enable data to be continuously synchronized in real time, fostering visibility and interoperability across a broad range of data sources.


• | Data Warehouse: Our data warehouse, Adrenaline, stores massive amounts of data from across the business, organizes that data across many factors or variables and employs a massive number of processors to query that data in parallel, enabling employees across the organization to simultaneously access the same data for their various needs with subsecond response times on average. 


• | Domo ETL: Fusion is our data transformation engine that sorts customer data, making it possible for any dataset connected to Domo to be cleansed, combined and prepared for use leveraging Magic ETL, Data Flows and hygiene algorithms. 


• | Data Analysis and Visualization: Our Explorer analytics suite allows users to analyze, display, share and interact with data through pixel-perfect visualizations. Explorer is a data discovery tool that seamlessly works on mobile as well as on wall monitors in executive offices or manufacturing facility floors. 


• | Collaboration: Buzz is our standalone collaboration and productivity suite that integrates seamlessly with Domo's other features. Chat, sharing, organizational charts, profiles, and project management all help foster an engaged and curious workforce, so that anyone in an organization can participate in improving the business. 


• | Artificial Intelligence Algorithms: Domo's Mr. Roboto leverages machine learning algorithms, predictive analytics, and other artificial intelligence technologies to create alerts, detect anomalies, optimize queries, and suggest areas of interest to help people focus on what matters most. Mr. Roboto constantly scans incoming data to identify trends, anomalies and correlations, providing alerts and initiating business processes.

• | Partner Ecosystem: With the Domo Appstore, APIs and developer tool kits, Domo enables an ecosystem of partners to quickly build applications on the platform. We believe this will be a meaningful source of future lead generation as application creation investment thresholds are high. 

As of January 31, 2019, we had more than 1,700 organizations as customers, including 447 customers with more than $1 billion in revenue, which we refer to as enterprise customers. For the years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, our enterprise customers accounted for 47%, 46% and 45% of our revenue for such periods, respectively. We focus our sales and marketing resources on obtaining customers with over $100 million in revenue, with a particular emphasis on enterprise customers. We employ a land-and-expand business model and typically enter into enterprises within a specific division or for a specific use case. As our users see the value of our platform and user engagement increases, we expand our footprint within the enterprise. Over the year ended January 31, 2019, our subscription net revenue retention rate, which compares the subscription revenue generated from a cohort of customers that generated subscription revenue at the beginning of the same period in consecutive fiscal years (excluding customers from the cohort who canceled during the initial period), averaged over 100%, 110% and 100% for all customers, enterprise customers and non-enterprise customers, respectively. By comparison, over the year ended January 31, 2018, our subscription net revenue retention rates averaged over 100%, 115% and 95% for all customers, enterprise customers and non-enterprise customers, respectively. 
 For the years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we had total revenue of $74.5 million, $108.5 million and $142.5 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 46% and 31%, respectively. For the years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, our net loss was $183.1 million, $176.6 million and $154.3 million, respectively. 
The Domo Solution
We believe business technology must be as easy-to-use and intuitive as mobile consumer applications, while providing enterprise-grade scalability and security features. Everyone, from a CEO to a front-line employee, benefits from the functionality that Domo provides. Our platform fosters collaboration, efficient decision making, increased organizational productivity, and generates improved business results. The platform also is designed to help IT leaders deliver value rapidly to the business by seamlessly complementing their existing systems and infrastructure and unlocking value from their fragmented data and systems. While developing our platform, we have been focused on four key pillars.
All of Your People 
Our platform enables every type of employee to connect to, analyze, and leverage data from their smartphone. When everyone can use data, the value of the data increases significantly and everyone is equipped with a common set of facts across all levels of an organization. As a result, data-driven knowledge proliferates throughout an organization as more employees become capable of contributing to shared, collaborative analysis. When freed from the constraints of traditional business intelligence tools, these employees tend to not only become increasingly productive, but also feel more connected to the broader organization. 
All of Your Data in Real Time 
Our platform provides real-time access to quantitative and qualitative data, including through more than 1,000 powerful first-class connectors as well as a library of very flexible universal connectors that currently power over one hundred thousand Domo datasets. In addition, through Domo Workbench, organizations can connect to proprietary data sources regardless of where those data sources reside within an organization. This comprehensive approach enables every type of employee to design customized, real-time views of data and data trends. For example, a marketer can design a visualization that includes real-time data of the click-through rates of the online advertisements, the impact of regional marketing campaigns, and the benchmarks of his organization's campaigns across the years. 
Intelligence that Invites Actions 
Our platform leverages artificial intelligence, including machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics, to continuously power more advanced insights, recommendations and alerts. We thereby enable employees to be aware of what is happening on a real-time basis, and take appropriate action where necessary. As more organizations and users adopt our platform, we have access to more data, and our indices become more powerful, resulting in more effective benchmarking. Our platform, based on ongoing variance analysis, is capable of providing personalized, proactive alerts and recommended actions to every employee and writing back to source applications based on predetermined actions triggered after certain thresholds or behavior has occurred. In the case of a bakery, for example, our platform can alert the owner that she does not have enough flour to meet tomorrow’s demand and recommend a supply schedule to prevent future stock-outs.

Domo Appstore 
We have prebuilt applications for specific use cases, and our users, including development partners, can build tailored applications to address a wide range of potential use cases, with limited training and no or limited IT involvement required. These applications range from a real-time social index to evaluate an organization's engagement across various social media platforms to a predictive analytics toolkit that allows users to analyze "what if" scenarios and forecast the direction of key business metrics to an aggregator for an organization’s relevant mobile application statistics. To date, these applications have been adopted across a broad range of industries. Additionally, through the Domo Appstore, users have the option to make their applications available to all Domo users. This application ecosystem generates a powerful network for our platform — as users build, adopt and use additional applications, usage increases within an organization, which enables our platform to deliver even more powerful insights to those users. 
Through the power of Domo’s comprehensive cloud-based platform, organizations can finally provide all of their data, to all of their employees, all of the time. 
Key Benefits of Our Solution 
Domo is more than just a business intelligence, data connection, data warehouse, data transformation or ETL, data discovery, analytics, collaboration, dashboarding, visualization or reporting tool. These tools and technologies are typically provided by separate vendors today. Domo combines all of them in a single platform and enables truly digitally connected organizations. 
The Domo platform delivers six core benefits, and from the combination of these six, customers benefit from a seventh, a virtuous cycle of optimization: 
Executive and Outcome Focused Mobile Solution 
From the beginning, we targeted CEOs as key users of our platform. That concept has fundamentally influenced every aspect of the Domo platform from architecture to user experience. CEOs have huge demands on their time, are constantly on the move, do not have time or desire to learn complex software, need answers that quickly drive decisions, need to create alignment within their organization, need to focus on the exceptional items that should bubble up in their business instead of turning over every stone to see if something is off, and hunger for as much collaborative and correlative signal as they can get. Our platform was designed to meet each of these needs. 
Our native mobile application enables all employees, not just CEOs, to effectively manage their businesses and responsibilities using any device. Employees can see current status of business operations and receive automatic alerts for when they need to take action, delivered directly to their smartphone. Anyone can edit and interact with data and share it with colleagues in real time directly from their smartphone. While Domo was designed with mobile users first in mind, it is automatically accessible across laptops, TV screens, monitors, tablets and smartphones, via different browsers and visualization engines, which is a competitive differentiator.
Universal Data Model — Data Platform and Transformation 
Domo is changing the way people think about data. Data is no longer a currency only to be banked, but is the fuel that drives the business. Domo puts data to work, all of the data, together in an integrated, robust system, for all of the business’s employees. To accomplish this, Domo created a distributed data platform that was engineered to ingest, process, clean, prepare and make queryable all of a business’s available data, and serve it back with a subsecond average query response time, not just from a couple of databases or a single warehouse, or a few external cloud apps, but from all of the data, including systems that come online outside of IT’s influence like the myriad of cloud software providers each department might be leveraging. We believe that all of a business’s quantitative and qualitative data must be brought together, in one system, in order to deliver the types of encompassing views and timely insights today’s leaders must have. Our portfolio of connectors and cloud-based data warehouse provides a massively scalable solution to enable businesses to connect to their data systems. Our cloud-based ETL suite allows all of that data to be transformed and prepared together in a universal data format, enabling users to easily incorporate, change or discontinue different data sources without disruption. Our fast query engine searches the data, enabling insights to be generated. Now business leaders can have fully comprehensive views of what is happening, across all departments and across all systems. 
Digitally Connected Organization — Interconnecting and Orchestrating across Disparate Systems 
Businesses use many separate software systems to facilitate core elements of managing their business. This means there is no natural opportunity to leverage a broader, more holistic view of the state of the business or to take broadly informed actions and decision paths. It is very difficult to create alignment across the disparate organizations that use the siloed systems. This 
7

often creates walled gardens of data inside the business and blocks departments and teams from being able to effectively work full life cycle problems with each other. It also cripples the C-suite from being able to truly understand the nature of a problem or opportunity. Our comprehensive, cloud-based platform weaves seven critical platform components together to exploit this opportunity to increase alignment, accuracy and effectiveness of business leaders: data connections, data warehouse, data management, data analysis and visualization, artificial intelligence algorithms, and our partner ecosystem. An action in one system can have its influence measured in another, combined together in the same view, such as when marketing automation affects sales revenue generation, which in turn affects financial performance, to truly understand how best to guide the business.
Productivity — Fosters Getting Work Done Together
Our platform enables all employees to engage with each other with real-time data and business results at the center of the conversation. Employees can easily find others in their organization who access similar data and invite them and others with the appropriate permissions to engage in richer conversations to achieve business results. With Domo, users collaborate where the data lives, increasing everyone’s productivity and ability to act on the data. Our platform also enables organizations to share their data and collaborate with customers, suppliers and other partners outside of the organization. Additionally, any user can schedule critical insights to be delivered to the right inboxes, ensuring the right stakeholders are being kept up-to-date on relevant developments. 
Enterprise Security, Scalability and Compliance 
We have invested significantly to build security features in our platform that have enabled us to expand our presence within the enterprise. Because we connect directly to data sources that hold companies’ CRM, HCM, ERP and other sensitive data in our system, we must maintain enterprise-grade security standards for data access, privacy and administration. Our security protocols enabled us to attract enterprise customers across a wide array of industries, including many in highly regulated industries such as financial services and healthcare. Our security features, such as customer-controlled encryption key management, provide much needed confidence that the data on our platform is secure. 
Our native multi-tenant, web-scale, massive parallel processing capabilities and multi-dimensional architecture manage extremely large volumes of data and deliver real-time analysis at scale. On a typical business day, our customers in the aggregate typically query several hundred trillion rows from uncached queries. Even with this volume of data, we maintain a subsecond average query response time. We leverage an organization’s existing data systems, meaning IT does not have to re-architect what has already been built and does not have to invest in new infrastructure to implement our platform. 
We also provide IT departments with centralized governance and administration capabilities. Our platform enables IT departments to not only monitor the health of all data within an organization, but also actively control who has access to that data on a real-time, continuous basis. Our platform provides robust controls down to row level security that enable leaders to tailor data access based on a variety of categories, including role, geography or department. We provide the assurance of leading security and compliance certifications, including those relating to SOC 1, SOC 2 + HITRUST, HIPAA and more. 
Benchmarks and Applications — Ecosystem 
We built the Domo platform with the explicit goal that it be extended and leveraged by a rich ecosystem of partners, developers, business experts and entrepreneurs. Each of the core pieces of the Domo platform has been engineered from the ground up to be extensible and accessible through APIs and SDKs. We have also created the Domo Appstore, a marketplace for the distribution of additive capabilities and pre-built content from the Domo ecosystem, such as a new data connector, a best-practice dashboard, or a fully functioning custom solution, to extend their Domo experience. Third parties are able to rapidly develop rich applications that leverage the collective power of the Domo platform. Each of the core tenets of the platform are offered as services and functionality used to build the types of products that typically would be expensive and time-consuming to replicate. 
Virtuous Cycle of Optimization 
The combination of these six core benefits drives a seventh factor, a virtuous cycle of optimization. A digitally connected organization is able to leverage all of the data, people, systems, behaviors, automation, write-back, predictive analytics, machine learning, natural language processing and workflows to achieve its goals and improve the entire business. Customers get more value from their workforce, and get more value from their data. We believe this is only the beginning; the network effect of digitizing complex workflows, automating well known outcomes, suggesting courses of action, unlocking crowd wisdom effects within the business and anomaly detection across the entire organization will continue to improve as more of an organization's people, data and systems are connected to the Domo platform.

These applications can be tailored to the specific needs of a specific role, organization or industry and leverage all the benefits of our solution to enable everyone to improve decision making, business outcomes and financial results. Once built, users can share these applications within their organization, but can also elect to open the application to all our users, across industries and geographies.

Growth Strategies
Key components of our growth strategy include:

• | Increasing Our Overall Customer Base. The market for our platform is large and underpenetrated, as any organization of any size and in any industry is a potential customer of Domo. We believe there is substantial opportunity to add additional customers both in the United States and internationally as the need for all employees to access actionable, real-time data continues to drive market adoption of our platform. We are committed to further penetrating international markets and are investing in markets such as Japan, Asia Pacific and EMEA.


• | Accelerate Expansion within Existing Customers. We employ a land-and-expand business model and typically enter into enterprises either within a specific division or for a specific use case. As our users see the value of our platform and user engagement increases, we expand our footprint within the enterprise. We are focused on helping our users quickly realize the value of our platform. We have substantial growth potential within our existing customer base. We will continue to focus on showcasing the value of our platform to expand our footprint within our existing customers.


• | Extend Platform Functionality and Value Proposition. Our goal is to continue to enhance and broaden the capabilities of our platform to address our users’ evolving needs. To that end, we plan to continue to invest in enhancing the ease of use and self-service capabilities, scalability, security and performance of our platform and expanding the IoT, artificial intelligence and data management functionality of our platform.

We will continue to invest in establishing and strengthening these relationships to broaden this ecosystem.


• | Leverage the Data. The Domo platform is uniquely positioned to generate performance benchmarks and indices across a wide array of organizations and disciplines, and in time we plan to capitalize on that position to attract additional customers and broaden and deepen our relationships with them. Although no customer will have access to the data of another, given that customers bring their data into the same cloud-based platform, we could enable performance comparisons based on index derived from similarly-situated organizations.

Our Technology 
Our solution is comprised of seven core elements: 

• | connectors;


• | data warehouse and fast query engine;


• | Domo ETL;


• | data analysis and visualization tools;


• | collaboration tools;


• | artificial intelligence algorithms; and


• | apps and partner ecosystem.

These core elements were developed with two foundational considerations in mind:

• | accessibility for all users, with a heavy emphasis on mobile-first functionality; and

10


• | access, and applicability to business of all sizes, including those requiring enterprise-grade governance and security.

Connectors
The foundation of our technology is the ability to connect all of an organization’s relevant business data and then combine, cleanse and transform that data into formats that can be easily visualized and analyzed. 
Our platform provides real-time access to data through a broad and flexible set of connection options, including through more than 1,000 first-class connectors, which we define as read/write, API and standards based connectors that are available in the Domo Appstore, as well as a library of very flexible universal connectors that currently power over one hundred thousand Domo datasets. We also provide users an intuitive web-based toolkit, Connector Dev Studio, which allows users to build their own connectors. 
Our platform allows organizations to integrate directly with almost any source of data required to answer key business questions. Whether the necessary data is located in other third party systems, on-premise data stores, or even local machines, Domo provides easy access across all platforms with no coding necessary in most cases.  Since Domo has built and maintains a large library of connectors, organizations no longer need to directly deal with the confusing and constantly changing ecosystem.  Typically, all that is necessary are the security credentials required to access the data.  Additionally, the cloud-based nature of Domo means that not only is it simple for an organization to import data, but such data will also be continually imported and updated creating a “living,” real-time dataset with no hardware investment by the customer. For organizations with on-premises data solutions, or bespoke or legacy applications, we have developed Workbench, our secure data acquisition tool designed to easily and securely connect on-premises data to our platform. We thereby enable organizations to connect to real-time proprietary data sources regardless of where those data sources sit within the organization. QuickStart Apps help users load relevant data into a usable format with the click of a button. With a growing library of popular data sources that draw from years of role and industry experience, Domo guides users on what KPIs they should be measuring from the day they connect.
Data Warehouse and Fast Query Engine
Adrenaline, the Domo data warehouse, stores massive amounts of data connected from across the business, enabling anyone to quickly access the data they need.
After data has been imported into Domo, it is important that it is safe, secure, and available. Adrenaline uses industry-leading technologies to ensure that customer data is secure and encrypted while stored in the system. It is also stored in redundant systems to provide a safe and reliable retrieval. In the case of frequently changing, or updated data, Domo additionally stores historical versions of past data available for catastrophic recovery.   
Availability of the data is handled through Domo’s fast query layer.  All data is prepared and available for querying through this feature. Adrenaline organizes the data across any number of factors or variables and employs a massive number of processors to query that data in parallel. This service supports queries while building simple cards as well as complex, custom queries and dataset joins on datasets comprised of billions of records. Our fast query layer eliminates the need for IT to perform time-consuming data summarizations or other complex processes in order to maintain high query performance. On top of the flexibility, it provides subsecond average query response time, enabling real-time consumption of information.  The speed and flexibility at this layer differentiate between Domo from traditional solutions offered by our competitors.
Domo ETL: Data Transformation
Our self-service ETL toolset, Fusion, enables users to easily join, aggregate and cleanse data from multiple sources. Unlike some solutions that require separate tools to extract, transform and load, or ETL, data, Fusion permits users of all skill levels to clean and combine data within our platform.
With an intuitive, drag-and-drop interface, users with little or no expertise can easily combine all their data and transform it into a format that can be easily manipulated, visualized and analyzed. For data analysts, our platform includes SQL-based dataflows, which allow more technical users to combine and transform raw data sources for other users. Fusion also includes a variety of machine learning algorithm and predictive analytics tools to allow everyone to add intelligence to any dataset, enabling a range of data science analysis, including: 

• | cluster analysis to perform cohort analysis and discover relationships to understand complex data;


• | predictive models built on a suite of regression algorithms to better understand core drivers and influencers of key business metrics;

11


• | forecasting models using common forecasting methods;


• | time-series, multivariate, parametric and non-parametric algorithms to reveal abnormal or “interesting” data in any dataset; and


• | intelligent models built on machine learning algorithms.

All algorithms can be implemented using a simple wizard for configuration.
Real-time Analysis and Visualization
Our Explorer analytics suite, consisting of Domo Analyzer, Domo Pages and Collections, Domo Stories, Publication Groups and Domo Everywhere, allows users to analyze, display, share and interact with data through pixel-perfect visualizations.
Domo Analyzer allows users to analyze, display, share and interact with data across mobile devices and personal computers. Domo Analyzer combines an intuitive simplicity that allows business users to find quick insights and advanced capabilities analysts expect. Analyzer allows users to create their own workspace:

• | over 300 chart types and a robust mapping engine that enable users to immediately visualize area-specific data, even suggesting charts based on the data input so users never start with a blank slate;


• | the ability to see and manipulate the data in all columns that are applied to charts, along with any other unused columns that should be shown;


• | out-of-the-box visualizations that make it easy to review numerous time periods to see trends and comparisons;


• | pre-defined filters for any visualization, making it easy for viewers to explore the data and see results in specific areas;


• | the ability to change options, colors, series, and even chart types on the fly and get instant feedback; and


• | tools to allow users to verify that data is flowing correctly and on time.

Domo Pages and Collections allow everyone to consume and organize data in ways that are meaningful and personalized to them. It’s easy to drag-and-drop, re-size and group reports, which we refer to as cards, into collections, and build slideshows to share both internally or externally.
Domo Stories allows users to combine cards, text, and images in a dashboard to tell a powerful story about the data. Rather than simply arranging cards on a page, users can customize page layouts to emphasize certain points and guide other users through analysis of the data.
Other sharing tools include Publication Groups, which enable everyone to securely share filtered views of data with other individuals and groups, send a single card or a slideshow of cards through scheduled emails, enabling everyone to share valuable information with teams or external stakeholders. 
Domo Everywhere is a set of embedded analytics tools that enable organizations to securely share data with customers, partners and vendors, without having to recreate new or special datasets. Content can be shared in portals, or web properties or even inside applications. Once embedded, any parameters applied to a card can be reflected in the embedded report. In addition, user access can be controlled by using Single Sign On and personal data permissions, or PDPs, to pass parameters back to Domo.
Real-time Collaboration
Domo connects all employees across an organization, while also allowing everyone to customize and create personalized experiences to help them learn and invite action on those items that are uniquely important to them. 
Our Org Explorer and Profiles features bring a social component and transparency to an organization, allowing all employees to see other employees’ role within the organization, find their contact information and learn how they contribute to the organization. Everyone can see what cards their coworkers are following, and then follow the same information, or share their own data with them proactively.

Once connected with the right people, Buzz aggregates all collaboration activity, in a single context-sensitive, easily navigable view. This allows an entire organization to share and discuss data in real time, to make better decisions more quickly. With Buzz, users can:

• | chat with individuals and teams around real-time data through both public and private channels and direct messages;


• | share alerts with other users; and


• | search for and share attachments with an easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface.

Other features to promote collaboration are included throughout our platform, including:

• | Report Scheduler, which allows users to schedule delivery of a card or page to anyone;


• | Snapshot Annotation, which allows users to call out a specific spike or trends in data, annotate on any card to highlight it for others and initiate a conversation from any device;


• | Projects and Tasks, which help users quickly take action with simple planning and assignment tools, including creating a task directly from a Buzz thread; and


• | Alerts, which prompt timely collaboration and action.

Artificial Intelligence Algorithms
Through Mr. Roboto, which leverages machine learning algorithms, artificial intelligence and predictive analytics, Domo creates alerts, detects anomalies, optimizes queries, and suggests areas of interest to help people focus on what matters most. We are also developing additional artificial intelligence capabilities to enable users to develop benchmarks and indexes based on data in the Domo platform, as well as automatic write back to other systems.
Domo was designed and built from the ground up to deliberately and seamlessly combine all the traditional disparate technologies into a single system.  This seamless combination allows our customers to apply advanced analytics and machine learning to their data for a variety of uses, including:  

• | modeling access patterns to allow for intelligent alerts that inform users of what is happening with both their data and their organization — even if the user didn’t explicitly ask for it; and


• | analyzing popular consumption paths to allow for customized recommendations for data, reports, and even conversations that users may find interesting or may have missed.

Partner Ecosystem: App Development Platform and Appstore 
The Domo Appstore offers hundreds of apps, developed internally and by an open ecosystem of partners, providing expertise across a variety of industries. Developer tools and programmatic APIs enable the rapid development and delivery of custom apps leveraging the Domo platform and services. 
Domo’s developer portal provides all of the tools and documentation needed to build custom apps leveraging our platform. Our App Design Studio lets non-technical users harness the power of Adobe Illustrator to build real-time infographics, and our App Dev Studio allows users to gain ultimate flexibility and develop customer visualizations using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and just about any web technology.
Underlying our technology approach are two key considerations:

• | accessibility for all users, which includes a heavy emphasis on mobile; and


• | applicability to business of all sizes, requiring enterprise-grade governance.

Mobile-First Functionality 
Domo’s native mobile applications for iOS and Android, and also mobile web browsers, enable employees to effectively manage their responsibilities using their mobile device. Domo Mobile unlocks the ability for users to access their data and collaborate with their teams in real time, from anywhere.

• | Build Once and Done. When data is loaded or content created in Domo, it is immediately available for consumption on mobile devices, tablets, and more. There is no need to maintain separate mobile versions of visualizations.


• | Powerful Visualization Exploration. Domo’s powerful page filters tool is also available on mobile. Whether it’s an executive walking into a retail store or a manufacturing manager looking at a specific product line, individuals can quickly filter a page to find the story they are interested in.


• | Collaborate on the Go. Just because users are out of the office doesn’t mean they can’t collaborate with their team around business. All the benefits of Buzz, Domo’s powerful chat and collaboration platform, are available on any mobile device.


• | Share Key Metrics Internally and Externally. Data owners can share important information with internal or external collaborators while limiting their access to sensitive or irrelevant data. Snapshot Annotations also help you make visuals clearer to your audience on mobile devices.


• | Browse Your Organization. As a platform for business management, understanding organizational structure is key. With Domo, an organization's contact list and organizational chart are on any mobile device, for access to the people in the organization from anywhere, anytime.

Data Management, Governance, Security and Access Control
Domo is designed to meet the enterprise security, compliance and privacy requirements of our customers, particularly in highly regulated industries, such as financial services, government, health care, pharmaceuticals, energy and technology. 
In addition to advanced internal security controls, Domo provides extensive self-service features that enable administrators to stay in control of and have full transparency into data at all times. These features include access management, data governance and logging and monitoring tools.
Access Management
Creating users and granting access rights in Domo is the first layer in maintaining information security. PDPs allow users to create robust entitlement policies that govern access to specific data, increasing data usage while simultaneously helping to ensure that sensitive or irrelevant information remains secure. Pre-defined security profile options are included to allow organizations to easily deploy our platform. Each profile contains clearly defined access privileges, which can be turned on or off by default, and privileges and roles can be fully tailored to align with an organization’s unique policy. 
Logging and Monitoring
Administrators can easily monitor global activity across Domo with our Activity Logs console. Authorized users can quickly access usage metrics like login attempts, card views, card creation and card edits. The console also provides the times those events took place and by which user. Admins can filter and sort this data, and export to an Excel spreadsheet or CSV file.
Data Governance
Once data is connected to Domo, the platform provides capabilities and tools to manage it across its lifecycle. The Domo Data Warehouse is a dynamic 3D management console that enables IT professionals to interact with and curate every data source in Domo. Administrators can see which data sources are updating, identify potential problems, understand existing data relationships, and gauge the size of each data source, all in one visually engaging platform.
Domo Bring Your Own Key, or BYOK, provides the ability to rotate encryption keys numerous times a day. Through this user-controlled encryption, organizations can revoke encryption keys at any time, nullifying all data in the Domo platform and preventing access to their sensitive customer data. 
Customers
As of January 31, 2019, we had over 1,700 customers. We have customers in a wide variety of industries, geographies, with 77% of our revenue for the year ended January 31, 2019 derived from customers in the United States, and sizes, ranging from small organizations to large enterprises. We define a customer at the end of any particular quarter as an entity that generated revenue greater than $2,500 during that quarter. In situations where an organization has multiple subsidiaries or divisions, each entity that is invoiced at a separate billing address is treated as a separate customer. In cases where customers purchase through a reseller, each end customer is counted separately. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, no single 
14

customer represented more than 10% of our revenue, nor did any single organization when accounting for multiple subsidiaries or divisions which may have been invoiced separately. 
We have invested in platform capabilities and online support resources that allow our customers to expand the use of our platform in a self-guided manner. Our professional services, customer support and customer success functions also support our sales force by helping customers to successfully deploy our platform and implement additional use cases. We work closely with our customers to drive increased engagement with our platform by identifying new use cases through our customer success teams, as well as in-platform, self-guided experiences. We actively engage with our customers to assess whether they are satisfied and fully realizing the benefits of our platform. While these efforts often require a substantial commitment and upfront costs, we believe our investment in product, customer support, customer success and professional services will create opportunities to expand our customer relationships over time. 
Sales and Marketing
We offer our platform to our customers as a subscription-based service. Subscription fees are based on the number of users and the tier of package deployed. Business leaders and managers are typically the initial subscribers to our platform, deploying it for a specific use case or department. Over time, as customers recognize the value of our platform, we increasingly engage with CIOs and other executives to facilitate broad enterprise adoption. A majority of our customers subscribe to our services through one-year contracts, but recently a growing percentage of new and existing customers have entered into multi-year contracts. In the year ended January 31, 2019, 43% of our new customers entered into multi-year contracts compared to 38% and 11% in the years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of January 31, 2019, 42% of all customers were under multi-year contracts and 58% of all customers were under one-year contracts. By comparison, 32% of all customers were under multi-year contracts and 68% of all customers were under one-year contracts as of January 31, 2018. This transition to a higher percentage of multi-year contracts, among both new and existing customers, has enhanced the predictability of our subscription revenue. We typically invoice our customers annually in advance. Our one-year and multi-year contracts generally automatically renew for additional one-year terms, with each party having the option to elect not to renew, and generally may not be cancelled absent material breach by us or the customer.
We primarily generate sales through our direct sales team, which includes both inside sales personnel focused on customers with under $1 billion in revenue and field sales to target enterprise customers with revenues over $1 billion. All sales personnel focus on attracting new customers as well as expanding usage within our existing customer base. We also make it easy for users and organizations to sign up for free trials on our website, which can be converted to paid subscriptions by the user.
We generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs. Our marketing programs target C-level, and senior line of business leaders spanning all functional areas of a business, including sales, marketing, finance, human resources and information technology. We also host Domopalooza, our annual user conference for current customers and prospects. 
We have also developed go-to-market partnerships with a number of key technology, system integrator and consultant partners both domestically and internationally to help customers and potential customers validate our solutions and provide introductions to potential customers, and in some cases to resell or provide professional services related to our platform. We anticipate that we will continue to develop a select number of third-party relationships to help grow our business.
Competition
Historically, software companies have not offered solutions that meet the needs of an organization with respect to providing real-time intelligence on business operations to all users, from the CEO to the frontline. In many cases, organizations do not have any solution or otherwise rely on manual business processes such as spreadsheets and reports, or combinations of single solution software. Certain features of our platform compete with products offered by various companies including those that fall into the following categories: 

• | large software companies, including suppliers of traditional business intelligence products that provide one or more capabilities that are competitive with our products, such as Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, SAP AG and IBM;


• | business analytics software companies, such as Tableau Software, Inc., Qlik Technologies, Looker Data Services, Inc., Sisense, Inc., and Tibco Software, Inc.; and


• | SaaS-based products or cloud-based analytics providers such as salesforce.com, Inc. and Infor, Inc.

15

We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following:

• | user-centric design;


• | ease of adoption and use;


• | features and platform experience;


• | enterprise-grade performance, including scalability, reliability and query response time;


• | brand;


• | security, governance and privacy;


• | accessibility across mobile devices, operating systems, and applications;


• | breadth of data source connectivity through third-party integration;


• | customer support;


• | continued innovation; and


• | pricing.

We believe that we compete effectively on each of the factors listed above; however, we expect competition to intensify in the future. It is possible that the large software vendors who currently do not have a competitive offering, some of which operate in adjacent product categories today, may in the future bring such a solution to market through product development, acquisitions or other means. In addition, several of our competitors have greater name recognition, much longer operating histories, more and better-established customer relationships, larger sales forces, larger marketing and software development budgets and significantly greater resources than we do. Therefore, it is possible that we may not compete favorably with respect to certain of the foregoing factors.
Data Center Operations
We rely heavily on data centers and other technologies and services provided by third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business. We serve our customers from multiple data centers in the following geographies: North America, Western Europe, and Australia. The data centers we use are designed to host mission-critical computer systems with fully redundant subsystems and compartmentalized security zones. Our platform runs within third-party data centers. As of January 31, 2019, we used Amazon Web Services, or AWS, data center facilities located in Western Europe, North America and Australia. We committed to spend an aggregate of $60.0 million between April 2017 and March 2020 pursuant to our agreement with AWS. If we fail to meet the minimum purchase commitment during any year, we are required to pay the difference. AWS may terminate the agreement upon written notice to us for cause, including any material breach by us. We also use Microsoft Azure data centers in the United States to host customer data and partner with a third-party provider to maintain Company owned physical servers at an Equinix data center in the United States.
We and our third party data center providers maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to ensure the security and integrity of customer data, protect against security threats or data breaches, and prevent unauthorized access to the data of our customers. We and our third party data center providers strictly regulate and limit all access to on-demand servers and networks at our production and remote backup facilities. 
We apply a wide variety of strategies to achieve better than 99.9% systems availability for our subscription services, excluding scheduled maintenance. Our systems are continually monitored for any signs of problems, and we strive to take preemptive action when necessary. Our data center facilities and the third party data centers employ advanced measures designed to ensure physical integrity, including redundant power and cooling systems, and advanced fire and flood prevention. 
Research and Development
We focus our efforts on anticipating customer demand to remain competitive in the marketplace. Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development and our ability to introduce new platform enhancements, applications, technologies, features and capabilities in a timely manner. Our research and development organization is responsible for design, development, testing, release and maintenance. Our efforts are focused on developing 
16

new platform enhancements, use cases, and features and further enhancing the functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of existing solutions. 
Research and development expenses were $76.2 million, $78.3 million and $75.7 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, patent and other intellectual property laws, contractual arrangements, such as assignment, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality procedures and technical measures to gain rights to and protect the technology and intellectual property used in our business. We actively pursue registration of our trademarks and service marks in the United States and abroad. 
As of January 31, 2019, we owned 89 issued U.S. patents and 39 pending U.S. patent applications. We also owned five patents in the People's Republic of China, one patent in Australia, one patent in Canada and one patent in Japan. The issued U.S. patents that we own are expected to expire between September 2020 and September 2035. We have sole ownership of all of our U.S. patents and pending U.S. patent applications. 
Our applications use “open source” software. Open source software is made available to the general public in source code form for use, modification and redistribution on an “as-is” basis under the terms of a non-negotiable license. We also rely on other technology that we license from third parties. Though such third-party technology may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we believe that alternative technology would be available to us. 
Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, and other technology and intellectual property created by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information, and all of our key employees and independent contractors have done so. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our vendors and customers. We also control and monitor access to our software, source code and other proprietary information. 
Regulatory Matters
Data privacy, information security and data protection with respect to the collection, storage, and other processing of personal data continue to be focuses of worldwide legislation and regulation. We are subject to data privacy, data protection and information security regulation by data protection authorities in the United States (including the states in which we conduct our business) and in other countries where we conduct our business. These regulations include laws requiring holders of personal data to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, requires comprehensive information privacy and security protections for natural persons with respect to personal data collected about them. We post on our website our privacy policies and practices concerning the processing, use and disclosure of personal data, and certify adherence to and compliance with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield Principles and the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks. Our publication of our Privacy Shield certification, our privacy policy, and other statements we publish regarding privacy, data protection and information security may subject us to potential governmental action if they are found to be deceptive or misrepresentative of our practices or in violation of applicable privacy law. We also may be bound from time to time by contractual obligations, including model contract provisions approved by the European Commission, that impose additional restrictions on our handling of personal data. 
The legal environment of internet-based businesses is evolving rapidly in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere. The manner in which existing laws and regulations are applied in this environment, and how they will relate to our business in particular, both in the United States and internationally, is often unclear. For example, we sometimes cannot be certain which laws will be deemed applicable to us given the global nature of our business, including with respect to such topics as data privacy and security, pricing, advertising, taxation, content regulation, and intellectual property ownership and infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In particular, the various privacy, data protection and data security legal obligations that apply to us may evolve in a manner that relates to our practices or the features of our applications or platform, and we may need to take additional measures to comply with such changes in legal obligations and to maintain and improve our information security posture in an effort to avoid information security incidents or breaches affecting personal data or other sensitive or proprietary information.
Data Security 
Domo is designed to meet the enterprise security, compliance and privacy requirements of our customers, particularly in highly regulated industries, such as financial services, health care, pharmaceuticals, energy and technology. Our architecture is 
17

designed to allow customers to maintain control of their data through various means including: multiple logical and physical security layers; least privilege and separation of duties access model; threat assessments of each new feature; transport layer encryption and encryption at rest that allows customers to manage their own encryption keys using Domo’s Bring Your Own Key, or BYOK; and extensive logging and monitoring of network, system and application events.
We voluntarily engage independent third-party security auditors to test our systems and controls at least annually against several widely recognized security standards and regulations. 
We have completed a SOC 1 and SOC 2 + HITRUST Common Security Framework, or CSF, examination. Service Organization Controls, or SOC, are standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for reporting on internal control environments implemented within an organization. Our datacenter facilities and services providers also regularly undergo ISO 27001 or SOC 1 or SOC 2 audits and numerous other audits to verify their security practices. We are also in the process of completing the ISO 27001 Information Security Management Standard Certification. The ISO 27001 security standard specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving a documented Information Security Management System within the context of the organization’s overall business risks. This standard addresses confidentiality, access control, vulnerability and risk assessment. We are also in the process of completing the ISO/IEC 27018 certification. ISO 27018 establishes commonly accepted control objectives, controls and guidelines for implementing measures to protect personal information in accordance with the privacy principles in ISO/IEC 29100 for a cloud computing environment.
We complete the two industry-leading information security questionnaires. This includes the Shared Assessments Standardized Information Gathering, or SIG, questionnaire, as well as the Cloud Security Alliance Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire, or CSA CAIQ. The SIG is composed of approximately 1,400 security questions spanning 17 domains. The CSA CAIQ is a set of security questions focused on cloud security controls, and it is mapped to numerous industry programs and standards including ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53, COBIT, amongst others. Both of these information security industry questionnaires assist organizations in evaluating a cloud providers operations and processes.
Domo supports HIPAA and HITECH compliance. We sign business associate agreements with our customers who require them in support of compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. We also offer a HIPAA assessment report performed by an independent third party.
Employees 
As of January 31, 2019, we had 761 employees, of which 634 work in the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe our employee relations are good.
