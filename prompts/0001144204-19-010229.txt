ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History
 
Zynex, Inc. was founded by Thomas Sandgaard in 1996, when he founded two privately held companies that eventually were folded into Zynex, Inc.  Zynex, Inc., a Nevada corporation was formed in December 2001 and is the parent company of and conducts business within six subsidiaries: Zynex Medical, Inc. (“ZMI”), a Colorado corporation, Zynex Neurodiagnostics, Inc. (“ZND”), a Colorado corporation, Zynex Monitoring Solutions, Inc. (“ZMS”), a Colorado corporation, Zynex Billing and Consulting, LLC (“ZBC”), a Colorado limited liability company, Zynex Europe (Zynex Europe ApS) (“ZEU”), a Danish corporation, and Pharmazy, Inc. (“Pharmazy”), which was incorporated under the laws of Colorado in June 2015 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ZMI (Zynex, Inc. collectively with the foregoing subsidiaries may be referred to as “Zynex” or the “Company”).


As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s primary subsidiary is ZMI through which the Company conducts most of its operations. One other subsidiary, ZEU, generated minimal revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 from international sales and marketing. ZMS has developed a blood volume monitoring device which is in the process of approval by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in the United States of America and CE Marking in Europe. As a result, ZMS has achieved no revenues to date. Our inactive subsidiaries include ZND, ZBC, and Pharmazy. The Company’s compounding pharmacy operated as a division of ZMI dba as Pharmazy through January 2016.
 
Over 99% of our consolidated revenue in 2017 and 2018 is attributable to ZMI. Our headquarters are located in Englewood, Colorado.
 
Active Subsidiaries
 
Zynex Medical, Inc. (ZMI): ZMI designs, manufactures and markets medical devices designed to treat chronic and acute pain, as well as activate and exercise muscles for rehabilitative purposes with electrical stimulation. ZMI devices are intended for pain management to reduce reliance on medications and are designed to provide rehabilitation and increased mobility through the utilization of non-invasive muscle stimulation, electromyography technology, interferential current (“IFC”), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (“NMES”) and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (“TENS”). All our medical devices are intended to be patient friendly and designed for home use. The ZMI devices are small, portable, battery operated and include an electrical pulse generator which is connected to the body via electrodes. The products are cost effective when compared to traditional physical therapy, and often result in better mobility, less pain and increased potential for a patient to return to work earlier than with traditional therapies alone. All of our medical devices are marketed in the U.S. and follow FDA regulations and approval.  Our products require a physician’s prescription before they can be dispensed in the U.S. We consider the physician’s prescription as an “order”, and it is on this basis that we provide the product to the patient and either bill the patient directly or the patient’s private or government insurer for payment. ZMI’s primary product is the NexWave® device.  The NexWave is marketed to physicians and therapists by our field sales representatives.   The NexWave requires consumable supplies, such as electrodes and batteries, which are shipped to patients on a recurring monthly basis, as needed.  
 
ZMI also designs, manufactures and markets the NeuroMove product. The NeuroMove contains electromyography and electric stimulation technology that is primarily used for stroke, spinal cord and traumatic brain injury rehabilitation (“SCI”), by reaching parts of the brain to re-connect with muscles, also known as neuroplasticity.  The NeuroMove product is primarily marketed to medical clinics. Zynex did not have material sales of this product in 2017 or 2018.
 
Zynex Monitoring Solutions (ZMS):
 
ZMS was formed in 2011 to develop and market medical devices for non-invasive cardiac monitoring. The blood volume monitor is a non-invasive medical device for monitoring central blood volume that would be used in operating and recovery rooms to detect blood loss during surgery and internal bleeding during recovery. This device has been subjected to multiple clinical studies, which are being utilized for collecting data to further validate the algorithm used to determine changes in central blood volume, and there are plans to conduct future, additional clinical studies. We have submitted a 510(k) application to the FDA and are responding to their questions. There is no guarantee when or if the product will be cleared for marketing by the FDA.
 
Concurrent to our FDA application, we are pursuing European Union (“EU”) Certificate European (“CE”) Marking. CE Marking is a certification that a product meets the standards established by the 28 nations of the EU and qualifies for sale in the EU and 4-nation European Free Trade Association.
 
The blood volume monitor has been tested in several International Review Board (“IRB”) approved studies and was used in several blood donation settings where hundreds of subjects have donated half a liter of blood with strong correlation to the index on the device. We have built a number of commercial devices in pilot-production and continue to refine the algorithms for the Blood Volume Index (BVI). In the fourth quarter of 2018 a U.S. utility patent was obtained for this unique application, and we believe this product could serve a currently unmet need in the market for safer surgeries and safer monitoring of patients during recovery. ZMS did not produce any revenue for the years ending December, 31, 2018 and 2017.

Zynex International (Zynex Europe) (ZEU):
 
ZEU was formed in 2012 to further progress Zynex’s international expansion. ZEU is currently conducting business and focused on sales and marketing our products within the international marketplace, upon receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. ZEU did not produce significant revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Product Uses
 
Pain Management and Control
 
Standard electrotherapy is a clinically proven and medically accepted alternative to manage acute and chronic pain. Electrical stimulation has been shown to reduce most types of local pain, such as tennis elbow, neck or lower back pain, arthritis, and others. The devices used to accomplish this are commonly described as the TENS family of devices. Electrotherapy is not known to have any negative side effects, a significant advantage over most pain relief medications. The benefits of electrotherapy can include: pain relief, increased blood flow, reduced edema, prevention of venous thrombosis, increased range-of-motion, prevention of muscle disuse atrophy, and reduced urinary incontinence.
 
Electrotherapy introduces an electrical current applied through surface electrodes. The electrical current “distorts” a pain signal on its way to the central nervous system and the brain, thus reducing the pain. Additionally, by applying higher levels of electricity, muscles contract and such contraction is believed to assist in the benefits mentioned above.
 
Numerous clinical studies have been published over several decades showing the effectiveness of IFC and TENS for pain relief. Zynex’s primary TENS device, the NexWave has received FDA 510(k) clearance. The NexWave is a digital IFC, TENS and NMES device that delivers pain-alleviating electrotherapy.
 
Stroke and Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation
 
Our proprietary NeuroMove product is a Class II medical device that has been cleared by the FDA for stroke and SCI rehabilitation. Stroke and SCI usually affect a survivor’s mobility, functionality, speech, and memory, and the NeuroMove is designed to help the survivor regain movement and functionality.
 
The NeuroMove product utilizes the relatively new science of “neuroplasticity” the process by which healthy parts of the brain learn to compensate and assume functions previously carried out by the damaged areas. To accomplish this task, the extraordinarily sensitive NeuroMove technology monitors muscle activity and detects brain signals that indicate, even without any visible movement, the brain’s effort to move a specific muscle or area of the body. Once the effort is detected, the NeuroMove induces actual movement through electrical stimulation, thus providing effective feedback to initiate relearning in the healthy part of the brain.

We believe the NeuroMove product is unique because its built-in microprocessor can recognize low-level attempts by muscles to contract and then “reward” such detection with electrical stimulation. We do not believe there are similar products in the stroke rehabilitation market. Some generic devices are being offered in international markets; however, we do not believe these products provide similar results with respect to stroke rehabilitation. When conscientiously using the NeuroMove product for three to twelve months, studies show that the majority of NeuroMove patients can re-establish the connection between the brain and impaired muscle and thus regain movement and functionality.  When movement and functionality are restored, the patient may experience increased mobility, increased productivity, an improved outlook, and a reduced risk of accidents, and may be able to engage in activities they were precluded from before using the NeuroMove. Sales of NeuroMove have not generated material revenue for years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
 
Our Markets
 
Zynex Medical (ZMI):
 
To date, the majority of our revenue has been generated by our ZMI electrotherapy products. Thus, we primarily compete in the home electrotherapy market, with products based on IFC, TENS and NMES devices and consumable supplies. We estimate the annual domestic market for home electrotherapy products at approximately $500 million. Due to our recently improved financial performance and related cash flows, we are currently growing our sales force to address what we believe is an unaddressed market in the electrotherapy market. The current opioid epidemic has been declared a health emergency and we are uniquely positioned to help reduce the amount of opioids prescribed for treatment of chronic and acute pain symptoms. We are committed to providing health care professionals with alternatives to traditional opioid based treatment programs with our prescription-strength products which have no side-effects. This has never been more necessary than it is today considering the staggering statistics.

· | Pain impacts the lives of more Americans than diabetes, heart disease and cancer combined. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pain is the leading cause of disability and seeking treatment for chronic or acute pain is the most common reason American’s seek health care.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Approximately 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Nearly 20 million Americans experienced high-impact chronic pain, defined as "limiting life or work activities on most days or every day in the past 6 months." 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | If pharmaceuticals such as opioids continue to be used as the first line of defense America will continue to see a rise in opioid misuse, addiction and drug-related deaths. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also distribute products such as JetStream Hot/Cold Therapy, Aspen LSO Back bracing and Comfortrac cervical traction, all products targeted at treating acute as well as chronic pain with minimal side-effects.
 
Key characteristics of our electrotherapy market are:
 

· | Collection cycles of initial payment from insurance carriers can range from 30 days to many months and considerably longer for many attorney, personal injury and worker’s compensation cases. Such delayed payment impacts our cash flow and can slow our growth or strain our liquidity. Collections are also impacted by whether effective billing submissions are made by our billing and collections department to the insurance carriers and other payors. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Prior to payment, the third party payors often make or take significant payment “adjustments or discounts.” This can also lead to denials and billing disputes with third party payors. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The majority of our revenue is generated by the sale of medical devices and from recurring patient supplies, specifically from our electrotherapy products sold through ZMI. We are reliant on insurance and our payor reimbursement. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Zynex Monitoring Solutions (ZMS):
 
ZMS is focused on developing products within the non-invasive multi-parameter patient-monitoring marketplace. ZMS is currently focusing on its blood volume monitor. We believe our product, once released into the marketplace (of which there can be no guarantee), will compete against multiple competitors, ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited range of products. We have not yet identified competitors for this product. ZMS has not generated any revenue as this product is still in the process of FDA approval and CE Marking.
Sales and Growth Strategies
 
To date, ZMI accounts for substantially all of our revenue and profit. We are currently focused on expanding our sales force to address what we believe is an untapped market for electrotherapy products which has recently become more attractive due to large competitors exiting the market.
 
In an effort to increase revenue and diversification to become less sensitive to reimbursement changes, we are continually adding new products to our ZMI sales channel, such as our hot/cold therapy, cervical traction and LSO back braces, which may offset any impact on revenue due to changes in insurance reimbursement rates of electrotherapy devices. We are also pursuing other opportunities, including the Blood Volume Monitor. We believe these events and actions will serve to focus and increase our market share in the market place and, in the future, grow our core business by providing our electrotherapy patients additional non-pharmacological pain relief and complementary products to our manufactured devices. We also continue to modify and refine our geographic sales channels through experienced sales representatives, representing a mix of Zynex employees, sales contractors and international distributors. As of December 31, 2018 we had approximately150 active field sales representatives. An insignificant amount of our revenue is derived from international sales; however, we continue to take steps to penetrate the global medical device marketplace.
 
Manufacturing and Product Assembly
 
Our manufacturing and product assembly strategy consists of the following elements:
 

· | Compliance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | Use of contract manufacturers as needed, thereby allowing us to quickly respond to changes in volume and avoid large capital investments for assembly and manufacturing equipment of certain product components. Domestically and internationally, we believe there is a large pool of highly qualified contract manufacturers for the type of manufacturing assistance needed for our manufactured devices.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Utilization of in-house final assembly and test capabilities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | Development of proprietary software and hardware for all products in house. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Testing all units in a real-life, in-house environment to help ensure the highest possible quality and patient safety while reducing the cost of warranty repairs. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We utilize contract manufacturers (principally located in the United States) to manufacture components for our NexWave and NeuroMove units and for some of our other products; and manufacture / assemble in-house for our NexWave and NeuroMove units. We do not have long-term supply agreements with our contract manufacturers, but we utilize purchase orders with agreed upon terms for our ongoing needs. We believe there are numerous suppliers that can manufacture our products and provide our required raw materials. Generally, we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of our required raw materials and components. We are always evaluating our suppliers for price, quality, delivery time and service. The reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our operations.
 
Distribution and Revenue Streams:
 
Currently, almost all of our revenue is generated through our ZMI subsidiary from our electrotherapy products.
 
We sell most of our medical devices through direct and independent sales representatives in the United States. Our field sales representatives are engaged to sell in predefined geographic markets and are compensated based on fixed amounts depending on the type of product sold and insurance carrier of the patient. Currently, the United States has been the market that we have focused on; however, we have established international distributors in Canada, Australia, Russia, China, India, Singapore, Holland, Germany, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Vietnam. Typically, we sell and ship product directly to our international distributors, who work directly with the ultimate patient or end-user. To date these international distributors have not generated significant revenue.
 
A significant portion of our revenue is derived from patients with insurance plans held by private health insurance carriers, typically known as HMO or PPO, who pay on behalf of their insureds and worker’s compensation claims. The remaining portion of revenue is primarily received from attorneys representing injured patients, hospitals, clinics and private-pay individuals.
 
A large part of our revenue is recurring. Recurring revenue results primarily from the sale of surface electrodes and batteries sent to existing patients with our units. Electrodes and batteries are consumable items that are considered an integral part of our products.
 
Private Labeled Distributed Products
 
In addition to our own products, we distribute, through our sales force, a number of private labeled supplies and complimentary products from other domestic manufacturers. These products generally include patient consumables, such as electrodes and batteries plus cervical traction, lumbar support and hot/cold therapy. Customarily, there are no formal contracts between vendors in the durable medical equipment industry. Replacement products and components are easily found, either from our own products or other manufacturers, and purchases are made by purchase order.

Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our products contain certain proprietary software.
 
During 2018, we received a US utility patent for our Blood Volume Monitor. We currently have applied for a utility patent in Europe as well. In the future, we may seek patents for advances to our existing products and for new products as they are developed. 
 
Zynex is trademarked in the U.S.
 
We utilize non-disclosure and trade secret agreements with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary information.
 
Regulatory Approval and Process
 
Federal Drug Association (FDA)
 
All our ZMI products are classified as Class II (Medium Risk) devices by the FDA, and clinical studies with our products are considered to be NSR (Non-Significant Risk Studies). Our business is regulated by the FDA, and all products typically require 510(k) market clearance before they can be put in commercial distribution. Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, is available in certain instances for Class II (Medium Risk) products. It requires that before introducing most Class II devices into interstate commerce, the product must first submit information to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a device legally marketed prior to March 1976 or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that do not require approval of a premarket approval application. When the FDA determines that the device is substantially equivalent, the agency issues a “clearance” letter that authorizes marketing of the product. We are also regulated by the FDA’s “GMP” (Good Manufacturing Practice) and “QSR” (Quality Systems Regulation). We believe that our products have obtained or are good candidates for the requisite FDA clearance or are exempt from the FDA clearance process. In November 2001, Zynex received FDA 510(k) clearance to market NeuroMove. In September 2011, Zynex received FDA 510(k) clearance to market the NexWave, our current generation IFC, TENS and NMES device. In August 2012, Zynex received FDA 510(k) clearance to market the InWave, our next generation muscle stimulator for treatment of female incontinence. Failure to comply with FDA requirements could adversely affect us.
International
 
Zynex has received CE Marking for several of its products. CE marking is the medical device manufacturer's claim that a product meets the essential requirements of all relevant European Medical Device Directives. The CE mark is a legal requirement to place a device on the market in the EU. Zynex is currently in the process of renewing the CE marking on several devices and obtaining initial CE marking for its CM-1500 Blood Volume Monitor
 
The Far East, Middle East, Eastern Europe and Latin American markets have different regulatory requirements. We comply with applicable regulatory requirements within the markets in which we currently sell. If and when we decide to enter additional geographic areas, we intend to comply with applicable regulatory requirements within those markets.
 
Zynex has received ISO13485: 2012 certification for its compliance with international standards in quality management systems for design, development, manufacturing and distribution of medical devices. This certification is not only important as an assurance that we have the appropriate quality systems in place but is also crucial to our international expansion efforts as many countries require this certification as part of their regulatory approval. The quality management system is audited on an annual basis and the current recertification is pending final audit review.

Government Regulation
 
The delivery of health care services and products has become one of the most highly regulated of professional and business endeavors in the United States. Both the federal government and individual state governments are responsible for overseeing the activities of individuals and businesses engaged in the delivery of health care services and products. Federal law and regulations are based primarily upon the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Each program is financed, at least in part, with federal funds. State jurisdiction is based upon the state’s interest in regulating the quality of health care in the state, regardless of the source of payment. Many state and local jurisdictions impose additional legal and regulatory requirements on our business including various states and local licenses, taxes, limitations regarding insurance claim submission and limitations on relationships with referral parties. Failure to comply with this myriad of regulations in a particular jurisdiction may subject us to fines or other penalties, including the inability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions.
 
Federal health care laws apply to us when we submit a claim to any other federally funded health care program, in addition to requirements to meet government standards. The principal federal laws that we must abide by in these situations include:
 

· | Those that prohibit the filing of false or improper claims for federal payment. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Those that prohibit unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally funded health care programs. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The federal government may impose criminal, civil and administrative penalties on anyone who files a false claim for reimbursement from federally funded programs.
 
A federal law commonly known as the “anti-kickback law” prohibits the knowing or willful solicitation, receipt, offer or payment of any remuneration made in return for:
 

· | The referral of patients covered under federally-funded health care programs; or 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for any goods, facility, items or service reimbursable under those programs. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition

In the market for medical electrotherapy products we face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of products. Our principal competitors include International Rehabilitative Sciences, Inc. d/b/a RS Medical, EMSI, and H-Wave. In addition, we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies.
Research and Development
 
During 2018 and 2017, we incurred approximately $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of research and development expenses. We expect our research and development expenditures will be limited throughout 2019.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 182 full time employees of which 63 are employed as direct sales representatives in the field. Additionally, we also engage approximately 100 independent commission-only sales contractors.
