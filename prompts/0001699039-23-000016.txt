For further information related to our services and financial results of our operating segments, see “Part I, Item 1. Business—Our Segments,” “Part II, Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis—Operating Results,” and “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 17 — Segment Reporting.”
Organization
Ranger Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in February 2017. In conjunction with the initial public offering of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), which closed on August 16, 2017 (the “Offering”), and the corporate reorganization we underwent in connection with the Offering, we became a holding company, the sole material assets of which consist of membership interests in RNGR Energy Services, LLC (“Ranger LLC”). Ranger LLC owns all of the outstanding equity interests in Ranger Energy Services, LLC (“Ranger Services”) and Torrent Energy Services, LLC (“Torrent Services”), and the other subsidiaries through which it operates its assets. Ranger LLC is the sole managing member of Ranger Services and Torrent Services, and is responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions relating to Ranger Services, its subsidiaries, and Torrent Services’ business and consolidates the financial results of Ranger Services, its subsidiaries, and Torrent Services.
The following diagram indicates our ownership structure as of February 28, 2023:

Our Segments
We conduct our operations through multiple business lines that are organized into three reporting segments: High Specification Rigs, Wireline Services and Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services. Our services, when utilized in conjunction with one another, strategically enhance our operating footprint by creating operational efficiencies for our customers and allow us to capture a greater portion of their spending across the lifecycle of a well. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the business lines within each segment.
As a result of three business combinations, coupled with executive management changes, the Company re-evaluated the reportable segments accordingly. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company bifurcated the legacy Completion and Other Services segment into Wireline Services and Ancillary Services, where the historical Processing Solutions segment has been consolidated into the Ancillary Services segment. Prior periods have been revised to conform to the current presentation.
High Specification Rigs
Our High Specification Rig segment provides high-spec well and complementary equipment and services to facilitate operations throughout the lifecycle of a well. We provide services to E&P companies, particularly to those operating in unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs and requiring technically and operationally advanced services. Our high‑spec well service rigs are designed to support U.S. horizontal well demands. 
Specifically, our high-spec rig services consist of the following:
•Well completion support. Our well completion support services are utilized subsequent to hydraulic fracturing operations but prior to placing a well into production, and primarily include unconventional well completion operations, including milling out composite plugs, frac sand or other downhole debris or obstructions that were 
introduced in the well as part of the completion process and installing production tubing and other permanent downhole equipment necessary to facilitate production.
•Workovers. Our workover services primarily facilitate major well repairs or modifications required to sustain the flow of oil and natural gas in a producing well. Workovers, which may require a few days to several weeks to complete and generally require additional auxiliary equipment, are typically more complex and more time- consuming than well maintenance operations. Workover operations include major subsurface repairs such as the repair or replacement of well casing, recovery or replacement of tubing and removal of foreign objects from the wellbore. All of our high‑spec well service rigs are designed to perform complex workover operations.
•Well maintenance. Our well maintenance services provide periodic maintenance required throughout the life of a well to sustain optimal levels of oil and natural gas production. Our well maintenance services primarily include the removal and replacement of downhole production equipment, including artificial lift components such as sucker rods and downhole pumps, the repair of failed production tubing and the repair and removal of other downhole production‑related byproducts such as frac sand or paraffin that impair well productivity. These and similar routine maintenance services involve relatively low‑cost, short‑duration operations that generally experience relatively stable demand notwithstanding changes in drilling activity.
The composition of our well service rig fleet makes it particularly well-suited to provide both completion-oriented services, the demand for which generally increases along with increased capital spending by E&P operators, and production-oriented services, the demand for which is less influenced, on a comparative basis, by such capital spending. The ability of our well service rigs to accommodate the needs of our E&P customers in a variety of economic conditions has historically allowed us to maintain relatively high rig utilization.
We currently have a fleet of 428 well service rigs, which we believe to be among the newest and most advanced in the industry and are considered to be high-spec rigs, with high operating horsepower (“HP”) (450 HP or greater) and tall mast heights (102 feet or higher).

HP Rating (1) | Mast Height | Mast Rating (2) | Number of High-Spec Rigs
550 — 600 | 112’ — 117’ | 250,000 — 300,000’ | 97 
500 | 104’ — 108’ | 240,000 — 250,000’ | 255 
450 — 475 | 102’ — 104’ | 200,000 — 250,000’ | 76 
Total High-Spec Rigs | | | 428 

______________________
(1)    Per manufacturer or historical records obtained through acquisitions.
(2)    The mast ratings of our high-spec well service rigs complement their high operating HP and tall mast heights by allowing such rigs to safely support the higher weights associated with the long tubing strings used in long-lateral well completion operations and is measured in pounds.
Wireline Services
Our Wireline Services segment provides wireline completion and production services necessary to bring a well on production. Our wireline services involve the use of wireline trucks equipped with a spool of cable that is unwound and lowered into oil and natural gas wells to convey specialized tools or equipment primarily for well completion, but also for well intervention, pipe recovery, and plugging and abandonment purposes. 
Our wireline services consist of the following:
•Production Services. Our wireline production and intervention services provide the information and the means to identify and resolve well production problems through our cased hole logging, perforating, mechanical, and pipe recovery services. Our cased hole logging services include cement bond evaluation, multi-arm calipers and ultrasonic logging services for casing and cement inspection. These are critical services to determine the integrity of the production casing, the cement outside of the production casing, and the production tubing. Our pipe recovery services are used to free drill pipe when it gets stuck in an open hole, or to cut tubing or casing for well intervention operations.
•Completion Services. Our wireline completion services are used primarily for pump down perforating operations to create perforations or entry holes through the production casing. These perforations are necessary to allow for hydraulic fracturing and producing from a hydrocarbon formation. In horizontal wellbores, the perforating guns are lowered into the vertical portion of the well and are then pumped out to the end of the 
horizontal wellbore. Then the perforating guns are detonated to perforate the casing and they are retrieved out of the well. This operation is typically repeated fifty to one hundred times to fully perforate, fracture and complete a one- or two-mile-long horizontal wellbore. Ranger uses innovative technologies to enable cleaner, safer, faster, and environmentally friendly operations.
•Pump Down. Our pumping services can be used during completion or intervention operations as a standalone service or in a comprehensive completion pump down perforating solution. Combining Ranger’s wireline perforating and pump down services maximizes operational efficiency through integrated safety, quality and communications systems. Our pumping services can be used during intervention operations for pressure testing casing, tubing and plugs, for injecting and pumping acid into the reservoir to stimulate production. Our pumping services can also be used in conjunction with our high-spec rigs or coiled tubing units to circulate composite frac plug cuttings, frac sand, and other debris out of the wellbore during completion operations. Ranger provides a range of high-pressure mobile pumps including ones that meet tier four emissions standards.
We have a fleet of 67 wireline units and 13 high-pressure pump trucks that are utilized in our wireline services. Our wireline services utilize high-pressure pump trucks to pump fracturing plugs and perforating guns into extended reach horizontal wells for pump down perforating completion purposes. From time-to-time our wireline units will be used in conjunction with our Ancillary Services. 
 Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services
Our processing solutions and ancillary services, which are described below, are utilized in conjunction with our High Spec Rigs and Wireline Services to establish and enhance the productive life of a well. Specifically, in connection with the operations of our high‑spec well service rigs, we also maintain a supply of additional service and rental equipment, including accumulators, acid and frac tanks, motor vehicles, trailers, tractors, catwalks, cementing units, pipe racks, power swivels, ram block assemblies, fluid pumps and related items. 
•Well Service‑Related Equipment Rentals. Our well service‑related equipment rentals consist of a diverse fleet of rental items, including fluid pumps (various horsepower pumping equipment utilized to circulate fluid in and out of wellbores), power swivels (hydraulic motor‑driven, pipe‑rotating machines used to deliver shock‑free torque to the workstring or tubing during well service rig operations), well control packages (equipment used to ensure formation pressure is maintained within the wellbore during well service rig operations), hydraulic catwalks (mechanized lifting devices used to raise and lower drill pipe and tubing to and from the well service rig work floor), frac tanks, pipe racks and pipe handling tools. Our well service‑related equipment rentals are typically used in conjunction with the services provided by our high-spec well services.
•Coil Tubing. Our coiled tubing services utilize coiled tubing units to perform well intervention and other production services on a well by injecting small diameter steel pipe, unwound from a reel, into an existing production string. Our coiled tubing services provide operators with a cost-effective way to workover, drill, or convey tools in live, producing wells and other extended reach, high angle wellbores.
•Decommissioning. Our decommissioning services primarily include plugging and abandonment, in which our well service rigs and wireline and cementing equipment are used to prepare non‑economic oil and natural gas wells to be permanently sealed or temporarily shut in. Decommissioning work is typically less sensitive to oil and natural gas prices than our other well service rig operations as a result of decommissioning obligations imposed by state regulations.
•Snubbing Services. Our snubbing services consist of using our snubbing units together with our well service rigs in order to perform well completion, workover or maintenance activities. Our snubbing services enable operators to safely run or remove pipe and other associated downhole tools into pressurized or highly deviated wellbores.
•Fluid Management Services. Our fluid management services utilize transport trucks, pumps and other tools and equipment to control and separate completion fluids and to haul oilfield fluids used in production. These services consist of the hauling of oilfield fluids, including drilling mud, fresh water and saltwater used or produced in well drilling, completion and production. Additionally, we rent tanks to store such fluids at the wellsite.
•Processing Solutions. Our Processing Solutions services engage in the rental, installation, commissioning, start‑up, operation and maintenance of Mechanical Refrigeration Units (“MRU”), Nitrogen Gas Liquid (“NGL”) stabilizer units, NGL storage units and related equipment. Our Processing Solutions segment provides a range of proprietary, modular equipment for the processing of rich natural gas streams at the wellhead or central gathering points in basins where drilling and completion activity has outpaced the development of permanent processing infrastructure.
Other
We incur general corporate and administrative costs that are not attributable to any of the operating segments or business lines, which are reported as Other. For further information regarding the results of operations for each segment, please see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations” and “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 17 — Segment Reporting.”
Competition
We provide services in various geographic regions across the United States, which are highly competitive. Our competitors include many large and small oilfield service providers. Our largest competitors in the current market include RCP, Inc., ProPetro Holding Corp., Select Energy Services, Inc., Oil States International, Inc., KLX Energy Services Holdings, Inc., Dril-Quip, Inc., Mammoth Energy Services, Inc. and Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure, Inc. In addition, our industry is highly fragmented and we compete regionally with a significant number of smaller service providers.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve are technical expertise, equipment capacity, work force competency, efficiency, safety record, reputation, experience and price. Additionally, projects are often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to create a highly competitive environment. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by striving to deliver the highest-quality services and equipment possible, coupled with superior execution and operating efficiency in a safe working environment.
Cyclical Nature of Industry
We operate in a highly cyclical industry and the key factor driving demand for our services is the level of drilling activity by E&P companies. In turn, the level of drilling depends largely on the current and anticipated economics of new well completions. Global supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and demand for natural gas are critical in assessing industry outlook. Demand for oil and natural gas is cyclical and subject to large, rapid fluctuations. E&P companies tend to increase capital expenditures in response to increases in oil and natural gas prices, which generally results in greater revenue and profits for oilfield service companies. Increased capital expenditures also lead to greater production, which historically has resulted in increased inventories and reduced prices, consequently reducing demand for oilfield services. The results of our operations, therefore, may fluctuate from period to period, and these fluctuations may distort comparisons of results across periods.
Seasonality
Our results of operations have historically reflected seasonal tendencies relating to holiday seasons, inclement weather and the conclusion of our customers’ annual drilling and completion of capital expenditure budgets. Our most notable declines generally occur in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. Additionally, some of the areas in which we have operations, including the Denver-Julesburg Basin and the Bakken Shale, are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions, primarily during the winter months. During periods of heavy snow, ice, wind or rain, we may be unable to move our equipment between locations, thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenue, or we could suffer weather-related damage to our facilities and equipment resulting in delays in operations.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing activities are typically performed through local operations in each geographical region and are supported by sales representatives at our corporate headquarters. Our senior management takes an active role in supporting our sales and marketing personnel. We believe our field sales personnel understand the region‑specific issues and customer operating procedures and, therefore, can more effectively target marketing activities. Our sales representatives work closely with our managers and field sales personnel to target market opportunities.
Significant Customers
During the year ended December 31, 2022, one customer accounted for approximately 10% of our consolidated revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2021, two customers accounted for approximately 25% of our consolidated revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our top five revenue-generating customers represented approximately 36% and 42% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. No other customers represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. We have a diverse portfolio of customers which included approximately 350 distinct customers that we served during 2022.
Suppliers
Our internal supply chain team manages sourcing and logistics to ensure flexibility and continuity of supply in a cost- effective manner across all areas of our operations. We have built long‑term relationships with multiple industry leading suppliers of materials and equipment. We purchase a wide variety of materials, parts and components that are manufactured and supplied for our operations. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials. We have generally been able to obtain the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our operations on a timely basis.
Human Capital
We combine our services offerings with a highly skilled and experienced workforce, enabling us to consistently deliver exceptional service while maintaining high health, safety and environmental standards. We invest in attracting, developing and retaining talented personnel and believe we have good relationships with our employees. Our personnel are dedicated to redefining services for our customers, driving new thinking, raising standards and rising to challenges. We believe that our efficient operational performance, executed at a high level of integrity, strong safety record and low leverage provides a competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,000 full-time and part-time employees and we hire independent contractors on an as-needed basis. We are not a party to collective bargaining agreements, nor do we have any unionized labor. 
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
Our operations, which support the oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities pursued by our customers, are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational safety and health, the discharge of materials into the environment, solid and hazardous waste management, fluid transportation and disposal and environmental protection. These laws and regulations may, among other things: (i) limit or prohibit our operations on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; (ii) require remedial measures to mitigate or clean up pollution from former and ongoing operations; (iii) impose restrictions on the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected in formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities; (iv) impose specific safety and health standards or criteria addressing worker protection; and (v) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.
Numerous governmental entities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of delays in the permitting or performance of projects; the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations in a particular area; and governmental or private claims for personal injury or property or natural resource damages.
The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may adversely affect the environment, and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. Our customers may also incur increased costs or delays or restrictions in permitting or operating activities as a result of more stringent environmental laws and regulations, which may result in a curtailment of exploration, development or production activities that would reduce the demand for our services.
Worker Health and Safety
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public.
Radioactive Materials
Naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) may contaminate extraction and processing equipment used in the oil and natural gas industry, most often in the form of scale. The waste resulting from such contamination is regulated by federal and state laws. Standards have been developed for worker protection, treatment, storage, and disposal of NORM and NORM waste, management of NORM-contaminated waste piles, containers and tanks and limitations on the relinquishment of NORM-contaminated land for unrestricted use under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and state laws. We may incur significant costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of NORM.
Hazardous Substances and Wastes and Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials
The RCRA, and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Pursuant to rules issued by the EPA, individual states can have delegated authority to administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. In the course of our operations, we generate industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and oils that are regulated as hazardous materials. Drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, or other state or federal laws.
However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Reclassification of drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes as hazardous under RCRA could result in an increase in our, as well as the oil and natural gas E&P industries’, costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Additionally, other wastes handled at E&P sites or generated in the course of providing well services may not fall within this exclusion.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and comparable state laws impose strict, joint and several liability for environmental contamination and damages to natural resources without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons. These persons include owners and operators of real property impacted by a release of hazardous substances and any company that transported, disposed of or arranged for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances to or at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for, among other things, the costs of remediating the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, damages to natural resources and the costs of certain health studies. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs.
Water Discharges and Discharges into Belowground Formations
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and hazardous substances, into state waters and waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements imposed under the CWA require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of stormwater runoff from certain types of facilities. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. There has been substantial uncertainty regarding the scope of regulated waters in recent years, and any expansion in this scope could result in increased costs or timeframes to complete activities. The CWA and analogous state laws also may impose substantial civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance, including spills and other non-authorized discharges.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills. The OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities and onshore facilities, including exploration and production facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under the OPA, responsible parties including owners and operators of onshore facilities 
may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. The OPA also requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare facility response plans (“FRP”) for responding to a worst-case discharge of oil into waters of the United States.
Our oil and natural gas producing customers dispose of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids gathered from oil and natural gas producing operations in accordance with permits issued by government authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern relates to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids resulting from oil and natural gas activities. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. States may, from time to time, develop and implement plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. In addition, ongoing lawsuits allege that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by our customers to dispose of flowback and produced water and certain other oilfield fluids. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity also could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste disposal.
Any one or more of these developments may necessitate that our customers limit disposal well volumes, rates or locations, or may require our customers or third party disposal well operators that dispose of customer wastewater to shut down disposal wells, which could adversely affect our customers’ business and result in a corresponding decrease in the need for our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Air Emissions
Some of our operations also result in emissions of regulated air pollutants. The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and analogous state laws require permits for certain facilities that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere that could adversely affect environmental quality. These laws and their implementing regulations also impose limitations on air emissions and require adherence to maintenance, work practice, reporting and record keeping and other requirements. Failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit or other regulatory requirements could result in the imposition of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties. In addition, we or our customers could be required to shut down or retrofit existing equipment, leading to additional capital or operating expenses and operational delays.
Many of these regulatory requirements, including New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards, are expected to be made more stringent over time as a result of stricter ambient air quality standards and other air quality protection goals adopted by the EPA. Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business. For example, in June 2016, the EPA published additional final rules establishing new emissions standards for methane and additional standards for Volatile Organic Compounds from certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. In September 2020, the EPA finalized amendments which removed the transmission and storage segment from the oil and natural gas source category and rescinded the methane-specific requirements for production and processing facilities. Subsequently, the U.S. Congress approved, and President Biden signed into law, a resolution under the Congressional Review Act to repeal the September 2020 revisions to the methane standards, effectively reinstating the prior standards. Additionally, in November 2021, EPA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would establish (a) new source and (b) first-time existing source standards of performance for methane and volatile organic compound emissions for oil and gas facilities. Operators of affected facilities will have to comply with specific standards of performance to include leak detection using optical gas imaging and subsequent repair requirement, and reduction of emissions by 95% through capture and control systems. The EPA plans to issue a supplemental proposal in 2022 containing additional requirements not included in the November 2021 proposed rule and anticipates the issuance of a final rule by the end of the year. In addition, some of our customers may operate on federal or tribal lands, and are subject to further regulation, including by tribal authorities and the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”). Potentially applicable regulations include the EPA’s June 2016 Federal Implementation Plan (“FIP”) to implement the Federal Minor New Source Review Program on tribal lands for oil and gas production. The FIP creates a permit-by-rule process for minor sources that also incorporates emission limits and other requirements under various federal air quality standards, applying them to a range of equipment and processes used in oil and 
gas production. In April 2018, the EPA proposed revisions to reportedly streamline the FIP. Neither the FIP nor the revisions apply in areas of ozone nonattainment, except, as the result of a May 2019 rule, to the Indian country portion of the Uinta Basin Ozone Nonattainment Area. As a result, the EPA may impose area-specific regulations in certain areas identified as tribal lands that may require additional emissions controls on existing equipment. Such requirements will likely result in increased operating and compliance costs for our customers in these regions.
In November 2016, the BLM finalized a rule regulating the venting and flaring of natural gas, leak detection, air emissions from equipment, well maintenance and unloading, drilling and completions and royalties potentially owed for loss of such emissions from oil and natural gas facilities producing on federal and tribal leases. In September 2018, the BLM issued a final rule rescinding the agency’s 2016 methane rule. However, in July 2020 and October 2020, federal district courts in California and Wyoming, respectively, vacated these rules, and litigation is ongoing. President Biden has also published an executive order calling for the review and potential revision of the September 2018 rule. Because of the foregoing, methane requirements on federal land remain uncertain at this time. Compliance with this and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase costs for us and our customers. Moreover, our business could be materially affected if these or other similar requirements increase the cost of doing business for us and our customers, or reduce the demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce, and thus have an adverse effect on the demand for our services.
Climate Change
The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHG”) as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations as well as the operations of our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHG.
In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, President Biden has highlighted addressing climate change as a priority of his administration, which includes certain initiatives for climate change legislation to be proposed and passed into law. Moreover, following the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, and together with the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. The federal regulation of methane emissions from oil and gas facilities has been subject to substantially controversy in recent years; for more information, please see our regulatory disclosure titled “Air Emissions.” Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, the United Nations-sponsored Paris Agreement requires member states to submit non-binding individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. Following President Biden’s executive order in January 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement and, in April 2021, established a goal of reducing economy-wide net GHG emissions 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. Additionally, at the 26th Conference of the Parties (“COP26”) in Glasgow in November 2021, the United States and the European Union jointly announced the launch of a Global Methane Pledge; an initiative committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030, including “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. However, the impacts of these actions remain unclear at this time. 
Governmental, scientific and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate change related pledges made by certain candidates for political office. These have included promises to pursue actions to limit emissions and curtail the production of oil and gas on federal land. For more information, see our regulatory disclosure titled “Hydraulic Fracturing.” Other actions that could be pursued by the Biden Administration may include the imposition of more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of LNG export facilities, as well as more restrictive GHG emission limitations for oil and gas facilities. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of parties have sought to bring suit against certain oil and natural gas companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to climate change or alleging that companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors or customers by failing to adequately disclose those impacts.
There are also increasing financial risks for companies in the fossil fuel sector as shareholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. For example, at COP26, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (“GFANZ”) announced that commitments from over 450 firms across 45 countries had resulted in over $130 trillion in capital committed to net zero goals. The various suballiances of GFANZ generally require participants to set short-term, sector-specific targets to transition their financing, investing, and/or underwriting activities to net zero emissions by 2050. There is also a risk that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector. In late 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it has joined the Network for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve has issued a statement in support of the efforts of the NGFS to identify key issues and potential solutions for the climate-related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory authorities. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission recently proposed new rules relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related risks. We are currently assessing this rule but at this time we cannot predict the costs of implementation or any potential adverse impacts resulting from the rule. To the extent this rule is finalized as proposed, we could incur increased costs related to the assessment and disclosure of climate-related risks. In addition, enhanced climate disclosure requirements could accelerate the trend of certain stakeholders and lenders restricting or seeking more stringent conditions with respect to their investments in certain carbon intensive sectors.
The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil and natural gas, which could reduce demand for our services and products. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in our oil and natural gas customers restricting or cancelling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing their ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for our services and products. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Our customers are reliant on hydraulic fracturing services in connection with their production of oil and natural gas. Hydraulic fracturing stimulates production of oil and/or natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations by injecting water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.
Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, however the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel and issued permitting guidance in February 2014 that applies to such activities. The EPA also finalized rules in June 2016 that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly-owned wastewater treatment plants. In addition, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in December 2016. The final report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain limited circumstances. 
Additionally, the BLM finalized a rule in March 2015 establishing standards for hydraulic fracturing on federal and tribal lands, but subsequently repealed the rule in December 2017. Although these rulemakings have been rescinded, modified, or subjected to legal challenge, new or more stringent regulations may be promulgated by the Biden Administration. For example, in January 2021, President Biden issued an executive order suspending new leasing activities, but not operations under existing leases, for oil and gas exploration and production on non-Indian federal lands pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices that take into consideration potential climate and other impacts associated with oil and gas activities on such lands and waters. Although the federal court for the Western District of Louisiana issued a preliminary injunction against the leasing pause, in response to the executive order, the Department of Interior issued a report recommending various changes to the federal leasing program, though many such changes would require Congressional action. As a result, we cannot predict the final scope of regulations or restrictions that may apply to oil and gas operations on federal lands. However, any regulations that ban or effectively ban such operations may adversely impact demand for our products and services. In addition, various state and local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements, well construction and temporary or 
permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas. For example, Texas, Colorado and North Dakota, among others, have adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. State regulators may also take action to address concerns regarding induced seismicity. For example, in September 2021, the Texas Railroad Commission (“TRRC”) issued a notice to disposal well operators in the Gardendale Seismic Response Area near Midland, Texas to reduce daily injection volumes following multiple earthquakes above a 3.5 magnitude over an 18 month period. The notice also required disposal well operators to provide injection data to TRRC staff to further analyze seismicity in the area. Subsequently, the TRRC ordered the indefinite suspension of all deep oil and gas produced water injection wells in the area, effective December 31, 2021. While we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, any action that temporarily or permanently restricts the availability of disposal capacity for produced water or other oilfield fluids may increase our customers’ costs or require them to suspend operations, which may adversely impact demand for our products and services.
In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. If new federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly to perform hydraulic fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could result in decreased oil and natural gas E&P activities and, therefore, adversely affect demand for our services and our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, results of operations and prospects; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future. It is possible that substantial costs for compliance or penalties for noncompliance may be incurred in the future. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies, could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently quantify.
State and Local Regulation
Our operations, and the operations of our customers, are subject to a variety of state and local environmental review and permitting requirements. Some states have state laws similar to major federal environmental laws and thus our operations are also subject to state requirements that may be more stringent than those imposed under federal law. For example, initiatives have been underway in the State of Colorado to limit or ban crude oil and natural gas exploration, development or operations. On April 16, 2019, the Governor of Colorado signed Senate Bill 19-181 (“SB 181”) into law. The legislation makes sweeping changes in Colorado oil and gas law, including, among other matters, requiring the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (“COGCC”) to prioritize public health and environmental concerns in its decisions. In keeping with SB 181, COGCC has adopted comprehensive rule changes covering a variety of matters related to public health, safety, welfare, wildlife, and environmental resources. Most significantly, these rule changes establish more stringent setbacks (2,000-feet, instead of the prior 500-foot) on new oil and gas development and eliminate routine flaring and venting of natural gas at new and existing wells across the state, each subject to only limited exceptions. Some local communities have adopted, or are considering adopting, additional restrictions for oil and gas activities, such as requiring even greater setbacks. Additionally, on December 17, 2021, the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission adopted regulations aimed at curbing methane emissions from oil and gas operations to include setting methane emission limits per 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent produced, more frequent inspections, and limits on emissions during maintenance.
Our operations may require state-law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project’s impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations and scenic areas. Texas has specific permitting and review processes for oilfield service operations, and state agencies may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. The development of new sites and our existing operations also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building and transportation requirements.
Motor Carrier Operations
We operate as a motor carrier and therefore are subject to regulation by DOT and various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations; regulatory safety; hazardous materials labeling, placarding and marking; financial reporting; and certain mergers, consolidations and acquisitions. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including requirements related to testing and weight and dimension specifications of equipment, drug testing and product handling. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of 
providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations and fuel economy requirements, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time driven in any specific period and requiring onboard black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size.
Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the DOT. Intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to safety regulations that often mirror federal regulations. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. DOT regulations also mandate drug testing of drivers. From time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted.
