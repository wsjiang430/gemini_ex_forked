     Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for the treatment of rare genetic disorders that result in severe, life‑threatening metabolic disorders. Our lead product candidate is setmelanotide, a potent, first‑in‑class melanocortin‑4 receptor, or MC4R, agonist peptide for the treatment of rare genetic disorders of obesity. We believe setmelanotide, for which we have exclusive worldwide rights, has the potential to serve as replacement therapy for the treatment of melanocortin‑4, or MC4, pathway deficiencies. MC4 pathway deficiencies result in the disruption of satiety signals and energy homeostasis in the body, which, in turn, leads to intense feelings of hunger and to obesity. Our development efforts are initially focused on obesity related to six single gene‑related, or monogenic, MC4 pathway deficiencies—pro‑opiomelanocortin, or POMC, leptin receptor, or LEPR, Bardet‑Biedl syndrome, Alström syndrome, POMC heterozygous, and POMC epigenetic disorders—for which there are currently no effective or approved treatments. We believe that the MC4 pathway is a compelling target for treating these genetic disorders because of its critical role in regulating appetite and weight by promoting satiety and weight control, and that peptide therapeutics are uniquely suited for activating this target.
 We have demonstrated proof of concept in Phase 2 clinical trials in POMC deficiency obesity, LEPR deficiency obesity, Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome, four genetic disorders of extreme and unrelenting appetite and obesity, in which setmelanotide dramatically reduced both weight and hunger. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, has acknowledged the importance of these results by giving setmelanotide Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of obesity associated with genetic defects upstream of the MC4 receptor in the leptin‑melanocortin pathway.  This designation currently covers four Breakthrough Therapy designation indications: POMC deficiency obesity, LEPR deficiency obesity, Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome. Setmelanotide is currently in Phase 3 development for POMC deficiency obesity and LEPR deficiency obesity, and we have initiated a combined Phase 3 trial for Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome. In addition, in late June 2018 setmelanotide was designated as Priority Medicne, or PRIME, by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP.  We have completed enrollment in the pivotal cohorts for both our POMC deficiency obesity Phase 3 clinical

trial and our LEPR deficiency obesity Phase 3 clinical trial.  We expect to report initial Phase 3 data from these trials in the third quarter of 2019, and subsequently plan to file a new drug application, or NDA, for FDA approval for these two indications concurrently.  We believe that we have demonstrated proof of concept in our Phase 2 clinical trial in Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and in Alström syndrome, and met with the FDA in May 2018 to discuss a combined pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in these indications.  Based on these discussions with the FDA, we have initiated and started to enroll patients in December 2018.  We have an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity and POMC epigenetic disorders. We reported initial, preliminary results in these additional Phase 2 indications in June 2018, and plan to provide a further update for these indications early in 2019.  In total, more than 330 obese subjects and patients have been treated with setmelanotide in previous and ongoing clinical trials in which setmelanotide demonstrated statistically significant weight loss with good tolerability.
 Obesity is epidemic in the United States and current treatment approaches have demonstrated limited long‑term success for most obese patients. We are taking a different approach to obesity drug development by leveraging new understanding of the genetic causes of severe obesity to develop innovative therapies that we believe have the potential for compelling efficacy. Setmelanotide’s unique mechanism of action at MC4R enables a targeted approach to treating very severe obesity in patients with specific, monogenic defects in the MC4 signaling pathway. By restoring impaired function in this pathway, setmelanotide can serve as replacement therapy for genetic deficiencies, with the potential for dramatic improvements in weight and appetite. We believe we are at the forefront of developing a therapeutic option to improve treatment outcomes in subtypes of severe obesity caused by genetically‑defined defects in the MC4 pathway.
 Setmelanotide activates MC4R, which is part of the key pathway that can independently regulate energy homeostasis, which refers to the body’s energy balance, and appetite. The critical role of the MC4 pathway in weight regulation was validated with the discovery that single genetic defects along this pathway result in early onset and severe obesity. An expanding set of severe obesity genetic defects are now identified that involve genes in the pathway which are either upstream of MC4R—for example POMC deficiency obesity and LEPR deficiency obesity—or genes that are downstream of MC4R or affect MC4R itself. We are focusing setmelanotide clinical development on patients with monogenic upstream genetic defects in which obesity is life‑threatening but the downstream MC4 pathway is fully functional. We believe setmelanotide has the potential to restore lost activity in the MC4 pathway by bypassing the defects upstream of MC4R, and activating the MC4 pathway below such defects. In this way, setmelanotide may serve as replacement therapy to reestablish weight and appetite control in patients with these genetic disorders.
 The first generation of MC4R agonists were predominantly small molecules that failed in clinical trials due to safety issues, particularly increases in blood pressure, in addition to having limited efficacy. In contrast, setmelanotide, a novel eight amino acid peptide, retains the specificity and functionality of the naturally occurring hormone that activates MC4R, and has exhibited preliminary evidence of efficacy without adversely affecting blood pressure in our Phase 1 and ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials. We are currently evaluating setmelanotide, which is administered by subcutaneous, or SC, injection, for the treatment of six genetic disorders of obesity: POMC deficiency obesity, LEPR deficiency obesity, Bardet‑Biedl syndrome, Alström syndrome, POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity, and POMC epigenetic disorders. We have positive Phase 2, proof of concept results for four of these indications thus far—POMC deficiency obesity, LEPR deficiency obesity, Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome, for which we are in Phase 3 development.
 POMC deficiency obesity is a life‑threatening, ultra‑rare orphan disease, with approximately 50 patients reported to date. Ultra‑rare orphan diseases are generally categorized as those that affect fewer than 20 patients per million. We estimate that our addressable patient population for this disorder is approximately 100 to 500 patients in the United States. Patients with POMC deficiency have unrelenting hunger, or hyperphagia, that begins in infancy and they develop severe, early onset obesity. POMC deficiency obesity results from two different homozygous genetic defects, both upstream of MC4R, that result in loss of function in the MC4 pathway. Currently, there is no approved treatment for the obesity and hyperphagia associated with this genetic disorder. We have completed enrollment of the pivotal cohort in our Phase 3 open label, single arm, multinational trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of setmelanotide for POMC deficiency obesity, with setmelanotide administered once daily by SC, injection for 12 months and we plan to report initial Phase 3 data in the third quarter of 2019. Previously, we completed a positive Phase 2 clinical trial in which two patients were enrolled and received treatment. These results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2016.  The first patient in this trial lost 146.6 lbs. over 118 weeks, from a baseline weight of 341.7 lbs. and the second patient lost 89.3 lbs. over 64 weeks, from a baseline weight of 336.9 lbs. Both patients experienced substantial reductions in hunger, with 

 
  4

 
hunger scores falling to one to two from baseline scores of nine to 10. Hunger scores were measured using a Likert score of zero to 10, where zero represents no hunger and 10 represents extreme hunger. Setmelanotide was generally well tolerated in this Phase 2 trial.
 LEPR deficiency obesity is an ultra‑rare orphan disease that results in hyperphagia and severe early‑onset obesity, with an estimated prevalence of 1% of subjects with severe, early‑onset obesity. We estimate that our addressable patient population for this disorder is approximately 500 to 2,000 patients in the United States. Like other deficiencies upstream in the MC4 pathway, LEPR deficiency results in loss of function in the MC4 pathway. Therefore, patients with this indication also manifest hyperphagia and severe obesity from early childhood. Currently, there is no approved treatment for the obesity and hyperphagia associated with LEPR deficiency obesity. We have completed enrollment of the pivotal cohort in our Phase 3 open label, single arm, multinational trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of setmelanotide for LEPR deficiency obesity, with setmelanotide administered once daily by SC injection for 12 months, and we plan to report initial Phase 3 data in the third quarter of 2019.  Previously, we completed a positive Phase 2 clinical trial in which three patients were enrolled and received treatment in this trial each experiencing significant weight loss and substantial reductions in hunger. These results were published in Nature Medicine in May 2018.  Setmelanotide was generally well tolerated in this Phase 2 trial.
 Based on our POMC deficiency obesity and LEPR deficiency obesity Phase 2 results, the FDA granted setmelanotide Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of obesity associated with genetic defects upstream of the MC4 receptor in the leptin‑melanocortin pathway, which includes both POMC deficiency obesity and LEPR deficiency obesity, enabling an expedited path to approval of setmelanotide for these two indications. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation for setmelanotide for the treatment of POMC deficiency obesity and LEPR deficiency obesity.
 Bardet‑Biedl syndrome is a life‑threatening, ultra‑rare orphan disease with a prevalence of approximately one in 100,000 in North America. We estimate that our addressable patient population for Bardet‑Biedl syndrome obesity is approximately 1,500 to 2,500 patients in the United States. Bardet‑Biedl syndrome is a monogenic disorder that causes severe obesity and hyperphagia as well as vision loss, polydactyly, kidney abnormalities, and other signs and symptoms. Currently there are no approved or effective therapies for Bardet‑Biedl syndrome. We have demonstrated proof of concept based on data from nine patients in our Phase 2 clinical trial in Bardet‑Biedl syndrome, indicating that this is also a setmelanotide‑responsive, upstream MC4 pathway disorder. Six of these nine patients showed significant weight loss and seven patients showed clear improvements in every hunger assessment. We reported preliminary Phase 2 results in the fourth quarter of 2017, and provided an update on these patients in the second quarter of 2018. Based on these results, the FDA recently included Bardet‑Biedl syndrome under our existing Breakthrough Therapy designation for setmelanotide. We provided an additional update on these patients in January 2019.  Setmelanotide has been generally well tolerated in this trial.
 Alström syndrome is a life‑threatening, ultra‑rare orphan disease with a prevalence of approximately one in one million in North America. We estimate that our addressable patient population for Alström syndrome is approximately 500 to 1,000 patients worldwide. Alström syndrome is a monogenic disorder, closely related to Bardet‑Biedl syndrome, that causes childhood obesity and hyperphagia as well as progressive vision loss, deafness, cardiomegaly, insulin resistance and other signs and symptoms. Currently there are no approved or effective therapies for Alström syndrome. We believe we have recently demonstrated proof of concept in our Phase 2 clinical trial in Alström syndrome, indicating that this is also a setmelanotide responsive, upstream MC4 pathway disorder. Based on these results, the FDA recently included Alström syndrome in our existing Breakthrough Therapy designation for setmelanotide. Setmelanotide has so far been generally well tolerated in this trial.
 We met with the FDA in May 2018 to discuss a combined pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in both Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome. Based on these discussions with the FDA, we initiated this trial and started enrolling patients in December 2018.
 We are also focusing on additional monogenic, upstream MC4 pathway deficiencies for which setmelanotide can function as replacement therapy and provide activation of the pathway downstream of the defect, promoting satiety and weight control. We have enrolled patients in Phase 2 proof of concept trials for POMC epigenetic disorders, and for POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity, for which we estimate our addressable population is approximately 4,000 patients in the 

 
  5

 
United States. For all of these patients, hyperphagia and obesity can have significant health consequences for which there is currently no approved treatment. We reported initial, preliminary results from these trials in June 2018, and plan to provide a further update for these indications early in 2019.
 In addition to our development of setmelanotide, in April 2018, we announced that we had acquired exclusive, worldwide rights from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, to develop and commercialize T‑3525770, now called RM‑853. RM‑853 is a potent, orally available ghrelin o‑acyltransferase, or GOAT, inhibitor currently in preclinical development for Prader‑Willi Syndrome, or PWS. PWS is a rare genetic disorder that results in hyperphagia and early‑onset, life‑threatening obesity, for which there are no approved therapeutic options. RM‑853 is currently in pre‑clinical development. We anticipate filing an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for RM‑853 with the FDA in 2020.
 Our company was founded in November 2008 by former biopharmaceutical executives who have successfully developed, commercialized and in‑licensed innovative pharmaceutical products, and we have subsequently expanded our senior management team to further broaden our team’s experience in developing, registering and commercializing new drugs. In addition, our scientific advisory board, or SAB, members have extensive clinical expertise in obesity, endocrinology and metabolic diseases. We intend to leverage the experience of our senior management team and SAB to develop and commercialize setmelanotide. Through our senior management team’s network of industry contacts, we will continue to evaluate additional product candidate licensing and acquisition opportunities.
 Our setmelanotide patent portfolio includes composition of matter patents for setmelanotide that expire in the United States in 2027, with possible patent term extension to 2032 under the Hatch‑Waxman Act. Additional patent coverage may be provided due to pending formulation patent applications, if such pending formulation applications were issued.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to be a leader in developing and commercializing targeted therapies for genetic deficiencies that result in life‑threatening metabolic disorders. The key components of our strategy are:
· | Rapidly develop setmelanotide for rare genetic disorders of obesity caused by MC4 pathway deficiencies. We are aiming to dramatically improve patient outcomes in severe obesity by targeting setmelanotide’s mechanism of action to the treatment of patients with genetically‑defined defects in the MC4 pathway. We are focusing setmelanotide clinical development on monogenic upstream genetic defects in which obesity is life‑threatening but where the downstream MC4 pathway is fully functional. We believe that focusing on these rare, life‑threatening conditions enables us to rapidly develop and commercialize setmelanotide using relatively small clinical trials.

· | Advance setmelanotide for POMC deficiency obesity and LEPR deficiency obesity as our first indications in upstream MC4 pathway deficiencies. We are currently evaluating setmelanotide for the treatment of six genetic disorders of obesity: POMC deficiency obesity, LEPR deficiency obesity, Bardet‑Biedl syndrome, Alström syndrome, POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity, and POMC epigenetic disorders. We have completed enrollment of the pivotal cohorts in our Phase 3 trials in POMC deficiency obesity and LEPR deficiency obesity, and plan to report initial data from these trials in the third quarter of 2019. We are working with the FDA, based on our Breakthrough Therapy designation, to prepare concurrent NDA filings for these two indications as part of an expedited path to approval for POMC deficiency obesity and LEPR deficiency obesity.

· | Advance setmelanotide for Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome as our second set of indications in upstream MC4 pathway deficiencies. We have demonstrated proof of concept in Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome, indicating that these are also setmelanotide responsive, upstream MC4 pathway disorders. Based on these results, the FDA recently included these disorders under our existing Breakthrough Therapy designation for setmelanotide. In May 2018, we met with the FDA to discuss a combined pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in both Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome.

Based on these discussions with the FDA, we initiated this trial and started enrolling patients in December 2018.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand setmelanotide development to additional upstream MC4 pathway deficiencies, including POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity and POMC epigenetic disorders. We believe we can leverage our experience with and mechanistic understanding of the MC4 pathway to advance development of setmelanotide for other upstream MC4 pathway deficiencies. We have an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial that includes patients with these rare genetic disorders, and reported initial, preliminary results in these indications in June 2018. We continue to investigate other potential indications that may result from MC4 pathway deficiencies, in which we may study treatment with setmelanotide in the future. Our Phase 2 studies are developed under “basket” protocols, which study a variety of different indications or patient populations administratively in one protocol, though each population is enrolled and analyzed separately. This enables us to study more indications for the same compound with a reduced administrative and regulatory burden.

· | Commercialize setmelanotide for rare disease indications in core strategic markets. We are building upon our clinical development and research expertise in these diseases to further the understanding and identification of patients with rare genetic disorders of obesity in the broader health care community. Our efforts, in combination with our Rhythm-sponsored genotyping initiatives, will help to drive: awareness of these disorders; suspicion among patients, providers and caregivers that individuals may be suffering from these disorders; and ultimately, genetic sequencing designed to support improved diagnosis. Through partnership with key thought leaders, advocacy organizations, patients, and care givers, we will provide critical stakeholder education to build an integrated community dedicated to improving the ultimate treatment of these patients. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Ultimately, we intend to establish our own commercial sales and marketing organization in the United States and other core strategic markets. We expect that this sales organization will target physicians treating these rare genetic disorders of obesity, including pediatric and adult endocrinologists. We believe that building our own commercial operations will deliver a greater return on our product investment than if we license the rights to commercialize these products to third parties. We may also selectively establish partnerships in markets outside the United States for sales, marketing and distribution.

· | Leverage the broad experience of our team in clinical and commercial drug development, and product acquisitions. We will apply our team’s extensive experience in developing and commercializing innovative medicines to the development and launch of setmelanotide. We will apply similar expertise to advance our second product candidate, RM-853, from pre-clinical to clinical development. In addition, we intend to identify and acquire new pipeline product candidates in related diseases. Our team is complemented by highly experienced external consultants and collaborators in the areas of drug discovery, development, manufacturing and regulatory approval.

 Our Product Pipeline 
 The following chart depicts key information regarding the development of setmelanotide, including the indications we are pursuing within MC4 pathway deficiencies, the current state of development and our expected upcoming milestones: Market Overview
 Recent Advances in the Understanding of Obesity
 Diet and lifestyle modifications remain the cornerstones of weight loss therapy, but they are limited by a lack of long‑term success for most obese patients. The long‑term efficacy of these interventions and for existing drug therapies is often limited by the counter‑regulatory mechanisms of the human body. For example, with diet induced weight loss, typically there is a large decrease in energy expenditure that offsets that weight loss. Accordingly, the discovery that the MC4 pathway can regulate both appetite and energy homeostasis separately—helping maintain the balance between food intake and energy burn—has defined an important target for therapeutics. In addition to POMC deficiency obesity and LEPR deficiency obesity, recent advances in genetic studies have identified several diseases that are the result of genetic defects affecting the MC4 pathway, including Bardet‑Biedl syndrome, Alström syndrome, POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity, and POMC epigenetic disorders. With a deeper understanding of this critical signaling pathway, we are taking a different approach to drug development by focusing on specific genetic deficiencies affecting the MC4 pathway. We believe that this approach has the potential to provide dramatic improvements in weight and appetite by restoring lost function in the MC4 pathway.

 Obesity Caused by Rare Genetic Deficiencies Affecting the MC4 Pathway
 The MC4 pathway serves a critical role in the control of food intake and energy balance. Its activity decreases appetite and caloric intake, and increases energy expenditure, with MC4R acting as the final step in the signaling pathway. This important hypothalamic, or lower brainstem, pathway has been the focus of extensive investigation for many years, and we have a deep understanding of this mechanism, which is unlike the targets of most other anti‑obesity therapies. As a result, we believe we can better predict the efficacy and safety profile expected from modulating this target. The critical role of the MC4 pathway in weight regulation was also validated with the discovery that single genetic defects at many points in this pathway result in early onset, severe obesity.
 The MC4 pathway is illustrated in the figure below, from the activation of the pathway to the resulting decrease in appetite and weight. Under normal conditions, POMC neurons are activated by brain satiety signals, including those resulting from the hormone leptin acting through LEPR. POMC neurons produce a protein, which is specifically processed by the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 1, or PCSK, enzyme, into melanocyte stimulating hormone, or MSH, the natural ligand, or activator, for MC4R. When genetic mutations disrupt this pathway, the result is hyperphagia and severe obesity.
 We are focused on developing setmelanotide for genetic disorders that result in defects in this pathway that are upstream of MC4R. Setmelanotide has the potential to restore lost function in this pathway by activating the intact MC4 pathway below the genetic defect. In this way, we believe setmelanotide acts as replacement therapy.
 The figure below also illustrates some of the upstream MC4 pathway deficiencies that are the targets of our development activities.

 Epidemiology of Rare Genetic Disorders of the MC4 Pathway
 Clinical Epidemiology

The figure below summarizes the indications on which we are focusing for the development of setmelanotide, including our clinical epidemiology estimates for the addressable patient populations within these indications.

 *The patient numbers above are based on Company estimates from clinical publications.
 †Epidemiological estimates are not yet available for POMC epigenetic disorders.
 We believe that the patient populations in the European Union are at least as large as those in the United States. However, we do not have comparable epidemiological data from the European Union and these estimates are therefore based solely on applying relative population percentages to the Company‑derived estimates described above.
 Genetic Epidemiology Studies
 We have estimated the patient populations for our rare genetic disorders of obesity primarily by identifying patients or by estimating from clinical epidemiology information. Another method to estimate the size of these ultra‑rare populations is by genetic epidemiology using newly available large genomic databases of either full genome or exome sequences. We have begun some substantial efforts, both directly and with collaborators, with a series of such databases. Much of our preliminary work has utilized a database of approximately 140,000 genomes, representative of the U.S. population. The results of this analysis were published in May 2018 in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, a leading journal in this field, which we believe validates the scientific and epidemiological importance of our findings.
 The results from this effort have been supportive of our clinical epidemiological estimates, even when using conservative genetic epidemiology assumptions. The results support estimates of the number of patients in the United 

 
  10

 
States who are homozygous deficient in the POMC gene, which is one of the two genetic defects causing POMC deficiency obesity, and who are homozygous deficient in the LEPR gene, are at least as large, or larger than, our clinical epidemiology assumptions, as provided above. In addition, the estimates of patients who are homozygous deficient in the PCSK1 gene, which is the other genetic defect causing POMC deficiency obesity, may be substantially larger than our clinical epidemiology assumptions. Overall, our clinical epidemiology based estimates for POMC deficiency obesity (up to 500 U.S. patients including both POMC and PCSK1 gene disorders) and LEPR deficiency obesity (up to 2,000 U.S. patients) support up to 2,500 U.S. patients combined. Our preliminary genetic epidemiology estimates suggest a total of approximately 13,000 U.S. patients with these disorders, representing a 5‑fold increase in our clinical epidemiology based estimates.
 We have already begun to expand our genetic epidemiology analysis into other genomic databases that contain patients with different demographics, and are actively working with a series of academic and industry collaborators. Our published data support that while individual mutations may cluster in specific demographic groups, these rare genetic disorders are seen widely across the demographic spectrum. The ongoing expansion of genomic data available in other forums also has the effect of supporting this effort. An important improvement in this effort will be working with data linked to phenotypic information to better characterize the genetic information we are analyzing.
 We believe the separate analyses that we have completed using clinical epidemiology and genetic epidemiology provide a robust range of patient population estimates for these rare disorders. However, to be conservative, we reference the clinical epidemiology figures in our descriptions of our target indications.
 Obesity Caused by Upstream Genetic Deficiencies Affecting the MC4 Pathway
 We have completed four positive Phase 2 trials of setmelanotide that provide proof of concept for four upstream MC4 pathway genetic defects in which obesity is life‑threatening but the downstream MC4 pathway is fully functional: For POMC deficiency obesity, LEPR deficiency obesity, and Bardet‑Biedl syndrome, we estimate an aggregate addressable population of up to 5,000 people in the United States.  In addition, we estimate that Alström syndrome has an addressable patient population of up to 1,000 people worldwide.   POMC Deficiency Obesity
 POMC deficiency obesity is an ultra‑rare genetic disorder, with severe, early onset obesity, defined here as a body mass index, or BMI, of greater than 40 kg/m2, and hyperphagia as hallmark clinical features. Patients with POMC deficiency obesity are extremely rare. There are approximately 50 patients with POMC deficiency obesity noted in a series of published case reports, each mostly reporting a single or small number of patients. However, we estimate that our addressable patient population for this disorder is approximately 100 to 500 patients in the United States, as most of the reported cases are from a small number of academic research centers, and because genetic testing for POMC deficiency is often unavailable and rarely performed. However, our genetic epidemiological estimates are several times higher.  Most patients are not currently diagnosed and based on discussions with experts in rare diseases, we believe the number of diagnosed cases will increase several‑fold with increased awareness of this disorder and the availability of new treatments.
 POMC deficiency obesity is caused by the loss of both genetic copies of either the gene for POMC or the gene for PCSK. This results either in loss of POMC neuropeptide synthesis, in the case of homozygous deficiency in the POMC gene, or in disruption of the required processing of the POMC neuropeptide product to MSH by the PCSK enzyme, in the case of homozygous deficiency in the PCSK gene. The end result of both of these two homozygous genetic defects is lack of MSH to bind and activate MC4R, ultimately leading to the lack of stimulation of downstream MC4 neurons and causing severe, early onset obesity and hyperphagia. POMC homozygous deficiency may also be associated with hormonal deficiencies, such as hypoadrenalism, as well as red hair and fair skin.
 POMC deficiency is characterized by voracious infant feeding, rapid weight gain and severe obesity, often in early infancy, with patients demonstrating remarkable weight increases many standard deviations from the normal weight growth curves. These patients and their caregivers have attempted to stabilize body weight with the help of psychologists, nutritionists and pediatric endocrinologists, all without significant success. We have completed enrollment in the pivotal 

 
  11

 
cohorts for our POMC deficiency obesity Phase 3 clinical trial, and expect to report initial Phase 3 data in the third quarter of 2019. Currently there are no approved or effective therapies for POMC deficiency obesity.
 Leptin Receptor Deficiency Obesity
 LEPR deficiency obesity is an ultra‑rare genetic disorder that causes hyperphagia and severe, early onset obesity. LEPR deficiency accounts for an estimated 1% of cases of severe, early onset obesity. Based on clinical epidemiology studies in small cohorts of patients with severe, early onset obesity, we estimate that our addressable patient population for this disorder is approximately 500 to 2,000 patients in the United States, through our genetic epidemiological estimates suggest the number may be moderately higher.
 Leptin’s role in obesity has been elucidated by characterization of severely obese people with homozygous mutations that impair the activity of leptin, including disruption of signaling at the LEPR, known as LEPR deficiency obesity. Under normal conditions, leptin can activate POMC neurons and the downstream MC4, but like other deficiencies upstream in the MC4 pathway, lack of signaling at LEPR results in loss of function in the MC4 pathway.
 Like POMC deficiency obesity, patients with LEPR deficiency obesity exhibit hyperphagia and severe obesity from early childhood. LEPR deficiency is also associated with hypogonadism and reduced immune function. We have completed enrollment of the pivotal cohort for our LEPR deficiency obesity Phase 3 clinical trial, and expect to report initial Phase 3 data in the third quarter of 2019.  It is our intention to file our NDA for LEPR deficiency obesity concurrently with our NDA for POMC deficiency obesity, as enrollment of our pivotal cohort completed almost simultaneously.  Currently there are no approved or effective therapies for LEPR deficiency obesity.
 Bardet‑Biedl Syndrome
 Bardet‑Biedl syndrome is a life‑threatening, ultra‑rare orphan disease with a prevalence of approximately one in 100,000 in North America. We estimate that our addressable patient population for Bardet‑Biedl syndrome obesity is approximately 1,500 to 2,500 patients in the United States. Bardet‑Biedl syndrome is a monogenic disorder that causes severe obesity and hyperphagia as well as vision loss, polydactyly, kidney abnormalities, and other signs and symptoms. For Bardet‑Biedl syndrome patients, hyperphagia and obesity can have significant health consequences.
 Bardet‑Biedl syndrome is part of a class of disorders called ciliopathies, or disorders associated with the impairment of cilia function in cells. Cilia are hair‑like cellular projections that play a fundamental role in the regulation of several biological processes, including satiety signaling. Cilia dysfunction in the hypothalamus is thought to contribute to hyperphagia and obesity in Bardet‑Biedl syndrome. Bardet‑Biedl syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disease that is caused by as many as 21 separate Bardet‑Biedl loci defects that result in a similar syndrome, though each Bardet‑Biedl syndrome patient only has one of these defects.
 Recent scientific studies identify deficiencies affecting the MC4 pathway as a potential cause of the obesity and hyperphagia associated with Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and demonstrate that an MC4R agonist can directly impact these symptoms. Studies in mouse models of Bardet‑Biedl syndrome show that deficiencies in the MC4 pathway contribute to the obesity and hyperphagia in Bardet‑Biedl syndrome, with animals developing hyperphagic tendencies as early as 10 weeks of age. Notably, these mice have decreased leptin receptor signaling, with the essential hallmarks of failure to activate POMC neurons. The potential utility of MC4 agonists is also supported by studies in Bardet‑Biedl syndrome rodent models, where mice have responded to an MC4 agonist resulting in reduced food intake and body weight. We have demonstrated proof of concept in Bardet‑Biedl syndrome indicating that this is also a setmelanotide‑responsive, upstream MC4 pathway disorder. We reported preliminary Phase 2 results for Bardet‑Biedl syndrome in the fourth quarter of 2017, and updated the clinical status of these patients in the second quarter of 2018. We have had discussions with the FDA on a Phase 3 design and submitted a draft Phase 3 protocol for FDA review. The FDA has indicated that this Phase 3 trial will include both Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome patients. We started to enroll patients in this Phase 3 trial in December 2018. Currently there are no approved or effective therapies for Bardet‑Biedl syndrome.

 Alström Syndrome
 Alström syndrome is a life‑threatening, ultra‑rare orphan disease with a prevalence of approximately one in 1,000,000 in North America. We estimate that our addressable patient population for Alström syndrome is approximately 500 to 1,000 patients worldwide. Alström syndrome is a monogenic disorder that causes childhood obesity and hyperphagia as well as progressive vision loss, deafness, cardiomegaly, insulin resistance and other signs and symptoms. Variable features include short stature, cardiomyopathy, and progressive lung, liver, and kidney dysfunction. Symptoms of Alström syndrome first appear in infancy, and progressive development of multi‑organ pathology leads to a reduced life expectancy, with survival rare beyond the age of 50.
 Alström syndrome is a ciliopathy caused by mutations in the ALMS1 gene, which has been shown to be important for cilia function. Like Bardet‑Biedl syndrome, recent scientific studies identify genetic deficiencies affecting the MC4 signaling pathway as a potential cause of the obesity and hyperphagia associated with Alström syndrome. Studies in a mouse model of Alström syndrome show a reduction in the number of cilia in specific neurons in the hypothalamus that are critical for MC4 pathway signaling. While Alström syndrome is less well studied than Bardet‑Biedl syndrome, the similar pathophysiology of cilial dysfunction and clinical presentation support that deficiencies in the MC4 pathway are implicated in the obesity and hyperphagia observed in Alström syndrome. We believe we have demonstrated proof of concept in our Phase 2 clinical trial in Alström syndrome and met with the FDA in May 2018 to discuss a combined pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in both Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome. Based on these discussions with the FDA, we initiated this trial and started enrolling patients in December 2018. Currently there are no approved or effective therapies for Alström syndrome.
 Other Upstream Genetic Defects in the MC4 Pathway
 In addition to POMC deficiency obesity, LEPR deficiency obesity, Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome, there are other upstream, MC4 pathway deficiencies for which we believe setmelanotide may function as replacement therapy, including defects that partially modulate POMC activity, such as POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity and POMC epigenetic disorders. POMC Heterozygous Deficiency Obesity
 POMC heterozygous deficiency results in a strong predisposition to obesity, though the epidemiology and clinical characterization of these patients is less well known. POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity is caused by the loss of one of the two genetic copies of either the gene for POMC or the gene for PCSK. An estimated 2% of severe, early onset obesity patients have POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity, which is much more common than the ultra‑rare POMC deficiency obesity in which both copies of either the POMC or PCSK genes are impaired. We believe that the most severe POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity patients may be suitable for treatment with setmelanotide. We estimate that our addressable patient population within severe POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity is approximately 4,000 patients in the United States, based on epidemiology studies in small cohorts of patients with severe early onset obesity and adult obesity. Animal models support that such heterozygous deficiency in the critical MC4 pathway can result in a strong predisposition to severe obesity. The effect of heterozygous deficiency was first demonstrated in MC4R heterozygous deficiency obesity.
 We are also studying patients with other MC4 pathway gene heterozygous mutations, including patients with heterozygous mutations in genes such as LEPR and Bardet‑Biedl, as well as patients with heterozygous mutations in more than one gene in the MC4 pathway. For simplicity, in this prospectus we refer to the group of such heterozygous patients as patients with POMC heterozygous deficiency, but we will be transitioning to more general language, such as patients with Heterozygous Mutations in the MC4 Pathway, as more of these patients enter our Phase 2 trials.
 It is thought that the obesity of patients with POMC heterozygous deficiency may have a broader spectrum of severity than POMC deficiency obesity. Therefore, our focus will be on the most severe of the POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity patients, with our estimate that only a small percentage of these patients will benefit from targeted therapy with substantial efficacy. As a result, we have initiated a Phase 2 proof of concept trial to confirm our hypothesis that the subset of patients with very severe POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity may be highly responsive to 

 
  13

 
setmelanotide therapy. We have an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity and reported initial, preliminary results in June 2018. There are currently no approved or effective therapies for POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity.
 POMC Epigenetic Disorders
 Recent scientific studies have identified patients with obesity due to a partial lack of MSH that is caused by epigenetic POMC variant. Given the recent discovery of these epigenetic disorders, there is currently no epidemiology data that defines the prevalence of POMC epigenetic disorders. However, we believe that these are rare disorders. Epigenetics implies DNA modifications, which can change gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. The most stable epigenetic modification is called DNA methylation. Recently, our academic collaborators in Berlin have described a POMC hypermethylation variant, which correlates with increased body weight in children and adults. Therefore, the presence of the POMC epigenetic variant leads to an increased risk of obesity based on reduced POMC gene activity. We expect that these patients under‑express the POMC gene product and as a result have a partial MSH deficiency. We have initiated a Phase 2 proof of concept trial to confirm our hypothesis that the subset of patients with very severe POMC epigenetic disorders may be highly responsive to setmelanotide therapy. We have an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in POMC epigenetic disorders and reported initial, preliminary results in June 2018. There are currently no approved or effective therapies for these disorders. Other MC4 Disorders 
 Based on setmelanotide’s biochemical structure and mechanism of action, we believe setmelanotide has the potential to serve as replacement therapy for other rare genetic disorders of obesity which have pathophysiology upstream of the MC4 receptor.  We are conducting research activities to study which potential disorders tied to the pathway may benefit from setmelanotide therapy.  Our basket study protocols, which enable enrollment of new populations with disorders tied to the pathway, allow us to study new potential indications without the administrative and regulatory burden of initiating a separate clinical study de novo for each new indication. Obesity Caused by Downstream Genetic Deficiencies Affecting the MC4 Pathway
 MC4 Receptor Heterozygous Deficiency Obesity
 MC4 Receptor, or MC4R, heterozygous deficiency is caused by the absence or loss of function of one genetic copy of the gene for MC4R. Consistent with POMC heterozygous deficiency, MC4R heterozygous deficiency results in a strong predisposition to early onset and severe obesity. MC4R heterozygous deficiency is the most common genetic cause of obesity. An epidemiological study performed in Europe in 2006 reported a prevalence of 2.6% of genetic defects in the MC4R gene in the obese population with a BMI of greater than 30 kg/m2, and studies performed in both Europe and the United States in 2000 and 2003, respectively, reported a prevalence of up to 4% of these genetic defects in more severely obese populations with a BMI of greater than 35 kg/m2. These prevalence rates suggest that there are approximately one million people in the United States with obesity caused by a mutation of the MC4R gene.
 These patients have a higher risk than the general population for early onset obesity and complications such as diabetes. Furthermore, MC4R deficiency may offset the beneficial effects of diet and exercise for sustained weight loss, limiting treatment options for these individuals. There are currently no approved or effective therapies for MC4 heterozygous deficiency obesity.
 While setmelanotide appears to show strong efficacy in a Phase 1b trial for the treatment of MC4R heterozygous deficiency obesity patients, it is downstream of where setmelanotide interacts with the MC4R, and we are currently focusing instead on genetic defects that are upstream of the MC4R. This is because we believe that many of these upstream genetic disorders cause even more severe, often life‑threatening obesity, and because setmelanotide has the potential to restore lost function in these upstream disorders, delivering more compelling efficacy.  We have conducted additional research that was published in Nature Medicine in May 2018, which suggests that a sizable number of individuals with obesity who carry MC4R mutations, and were previously assessed functionally normal, may respond to setmelanotide treatment. This may open the possibility of new indications for setmelanotide in the future.

 Expanding Attention to the Diagnosis of Genetic Obesity
 The Endocrine Society issued new Pediatric Obesity Guidelines in January 2017 that, for the first time, recommend genotyping patients with severe pediatric obesity and hyperphagia. These guidelines estimate that up to 7% of patients with extreme pediatric obesity have a genetic mutation, including genetic MC4 pathway deficiencies, that drives their obesity. The guidelines also suggest that this percentage of severe pediatric obesity patients will increase, with newer methods and wider awareness of the need for genetic testing.
 We are supporting several initiatives to expand the diagnosis of genetic obesity, including a genotyping study, called GO‑ID, and a patient registry, called TEMPO.  The objective of GO-ID is to develop a screening algorithm for selecting patients to be genotyped and identified with POMC deficiency obesity and LEPR deficiency obesity, and to guide further genotyping efforts. We have expanded our panel of obesity‑related genes used in our GO‑ID study in the second half of 2018.  TEMPO is a commitment to understanding the ongoing impact and burden of disease on patients and their caregivers.  This registry facilitates enhanced understanding of these conditions in the medical community and builds upon ongoing collaborations with existing patient registries in syndromic conditions such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome.
 We are also conducting genetic obesity epidemiology analysis of MC4 pathway genetic defects in a large representative sample of the U.S. population, and we expect to expand the genetic databases in our research efforts on an ongoing basis. The first results of this research were published in May 2018 in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, a leading journal in this field. An important improvement in this effort will be working with data linked to phenotypic information to better characterize the genetic information we are analyzing. In addition, we tested associations between BMI and loss of function mutation burden in various populations to further define the MC4 pathway and its potential impact on obesity, showing that the cumulative allele burden, or number of mutations along the MC4 pathway in a single individual, predisposes to more obesity.
 Limitations of Current Therapies
 Although drugs approved for general obesity can potentially be used in obese patients with MC4 pathway deficiencies, all have limited efficacy and aim to treat symptoms rather than addressing the underlying biology. There are currently no treatments approved specifically for obesity and hyperphagia in POMC deficiency obesity, LEPR deficiency obesity, Bardet‑Biedl syndrome, Alström syndrome, POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity, or POMC epigenetic disorders. Bariatric surgery is not an option in patients with upstream defects in the MC4 pathway who have severe obesity and hyperphagia. Setmelanotide: A First‑in‑Class MC4R Agonist in Three Phase 3 Programs
 Setmelanotide is a potent, first‑in‑class, MC4R agonist peptide administered by daily SC injection. Setmelanotide is in Phase 3 for the treatment of two rare genetic disorders of obesity caused by MC4 pathway deficiencies, and we have initiated a combined Phase 3 clinical trial in two additional rare genetic disorders. We also have an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in several other MC4 pathway disorders. MC4R modulates a key pathway in humans that regulates energy homeostasis and food intake.
 The critical role of the MC4 pathway in weight regulation was validated with the discovery that single genetic defects in this pathway result in severe, early onset obesity. The first generation MC4R agonists were small molecules that failed in clinical trials primarily due to safety issues, particularly increases in blood pressure, as well as limited efficacy. Setmelanotide is a peptide that retains the specificity and functionality of the naturally occurring hormone that activates MC4R, with demonstrated efficacy and little, if any, signal of increases in blood pressure.  In total, more than 330 obese subjects and patients have been treated with setmelanotide in previous and ongoing clinical trials in which setmelanotide demonstrated significant weight loss with good tolerability.
 Clinical Development in Rare Genetic Disorders of Obesity Caused by MC4 Pathway Deficiencies
 Setmelanotide is currently in Phase 3 development for POMC deficiency obesity and LEPR deficiency obesity, and we are initiating a combined Phase 3 trial for Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome. We have completed 

 
  15

 
enrollment in the pivotal cohorts for both our POMC deficiency obesity Phase 3 clinical trial and our LEPR deficiency obesity Phase 3 clinical trial. We expect to report initial Phase 3 data from these trials in the third quarter of 2019, and subsequently plan to file for regulatory approval for these two indications concurrently. We believe that we have demonstrated proof of concept in our Phase 2 clinical trial in Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and in Alström syndrome, and met with the FDA in May 2018 to discuss a combined pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in both Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome. Based on these discussions with the FDA, we initiated this trial and started enrolling patients in December 2018. We continue to study setmelanotide in these indications in Phase 2 development in long‑term extensions. We are also enrolling patients for the treatment of other rare monogenic disorders of obesity, including POMC and other heterozygous deficiency obesity, and POMC epigenetic disorders. We hypothesize that all of these disorders are genetically defined deficiencies upstream in the MC4 pathway.
 We are enrolling patients in two very similar Phase 2 clinical trials, each of which is designed to capture a broad range of indications under one investigational protocol, or a basket study. We believe that we have demonstrated proof of concept both in Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and in Alström syndrome, indicating that these closely related syndromes are also setmelanotide‑responsive, upstream MC4 pathway disorders. We reported initial, preliminary results for POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity and POMC epigenetic patients in June 2018. We plan to provide a further update for these indications early in 2019. We have also completed a Phase 2 trial in PWS.
 Based on FDA consultations to date, and the FDA granting Breakthrough Therapy designation for POMC deficiency obesity and LEPR deficiency obesity, and including Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome under the existing Breakthrough Therapy designation for setmelanotide, we believe we can seek indications for obesity caused by upstream defects in the MC4 pathway with rapid paths to approval, as compared to typical obesity drug candidates, because of the high unmet need and rare prevalence of these disorders. We expect to use the results of our Phase 3 clinical trials of setmelanotide in POMC deficiency obesity and LEPR deficiency obesity, which will run concurrently, as the foundation for proceeding directly to approval for these indications.
 We believe our data in POMC deficiency obesity, LEPR deficiency obesity, Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome provide strong proof of concept that setmelanotide, when targeted for deficiencies affecting the upstream portion of the MC4 pathway, can provide compelling efficacy for weight loss and decrease in hunger. There are still several genes to explore that are involved in signaling upstream in the MC4 pathway, which although not a current focus, may provide opportunities for further research in the future.  Proof of concept for substantial weight loss in patients with downstream, heterozygous mutations of the MC4R gene itself has also been achieved in a small, four‑week, Phase 1b clinical trial. While these downstream defects are not our current area of focus, based on new scientific research, we believe there is evidence supporting the potential for substantial weight loss efficacy in a setting of a partially defective, downstream defect in the MC4 pathway, which impacts a significantly larger population.
 Initial setmelanotide clinical trials were in patients with general obesity, which provided preliminary evidence of the safety and efficacy of the drug, and were the foundation for the Phase 2 trials in rare genetic disorders of obesity. In these trials, setmelanotide has generally achieved weight loss without adversely increasing blood pressure. These trials in the general obese population are described below.
 The following table outlines our ongoing and planned setmelanotide trials in rare monogenic disorders of obesity.

  Setmelanotide: Clinical Development Program in Genetically Defined Obesity
 Phase 2 Clinical Development in POMC Deficiency Obesity
 We have completed a Phase 2 proof of concept, open label clinical trial, Study RM‑493‑011, in two patients with POMC deficiency obesity in which these patients have been treated with setmelanotide for more than two years, resulting in profound reductions of hyperphagia and body weight, with good tolerability. The patients in this trial have provided proof of concept for the compelling effect of setmelanotide in this disorder. We are close to completing enrollment in the pivotal cohort of patients in our Phase 3 trial for this indication. The results of the Phase 2 trial were published in July 2016 in the New England Journal of Medicine, which we believe validates the scientific and clinical importance of our Phase 2 findings, and the accompanying editorial described the trial as demonstrating impressive hunger reduction and weight loss as well as improved insulin sensitivity. A brief update on these patients was also included in a publication in Nature Medicine in May 2018.
 The first setmelanotide‑treated patient was a 20‑year‑old woman, who at three months of age experienced the onset of obesity and hyperphagia. In spite of enormous efforts, the patient was never able to stabilize her body weight, except for brief periods, and she has remained hyperphagic. Ahead of our trial, the patient’s self‑reported trial hunger score was eight to nine out of 10 points, representing extreme hunger. She was entered into the trial at adulthood because of her 

 
  18

 
severe obesity, with a baseline weight of 155 kg, or 341.7 lbs., and a BMI of 49.8 kg/m2, and significant risk of comorbidities and a reduced life expectancy.
 The trial, initially a 13‑week, open label, ascending dose Phase 2 trial, was approved by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices, with open‑label one‑year extensions, and was planned to include approximately four to six patients with genetically confirmed POMC deficiency obesity. After efficacy‑gated dose escalation, aiming for weekly weight loss of approximately two kg, or 4.4 lbs., the primary endpoint was weight loss, with other key endpoints including hunger score, body composition, insulin and glucose parameters, metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, energy expenditure and general safety and tolerability.
 After 13 weeks of therapy, with approximately the first four weeks at sub‑therapeutic doses, our initial patient demonstrated weight loss of 25.8 kg, or 56.9 lbs., representing 16.7% of her initial body weight, with approximately two to three kilograms per week of weight loss demonstrated at the highest 1.5 mg/day dose. Hunger scores, measured using a Likert score of zero to 10, where zero represents no hunger and 10 represents extreme hunger, mirrored the rate of weight loss, moving from scores of eight to nine prior to our trial to zero to one, as the patient was treated with increasing doses of setmelanotide. After termination of the 13‑week main trial, the patient underwent a three‑week withdrawal period off drug and regained 4.8 kg, or 10.6 lbs., with a return to moderate to severe hunger. Following approval to restart setmelanotide treatment, there was an immediate reduction of hunger and subsequently a continuation of body weight loss. This patient was on continuous treatment for 106 weeks, with a total weight loss of 65.6 kg, or 144.6 lbs., representing 42.3% of her initial body weight. There was no apparent difference in the rate of weight loss during the initial extension phase versus the main trial, however over time, the rate of weight loss has slowed, though this patient has continued to lose weight. The patient’s need for continued therapy was supported by a short period of withdrawal after the patient had been treated for over one year. Reducing her daily dose from 1.5 mg/day to 1.0 mg/day resulted in an increase in her hunger scores from one to two points to four to five points, resulting in the patient requesting to be returned to her 1.5 mg/day dose, after which her hunger scores returned to one to two points. This data supports the physiological prediction that pharmacological treatment for this condition to suppress hunger will be required chronically. After approximately 106 weeks of treatment, her dose was reduced to 1 mg/day, and while her weight remained stable from week 106 to approximately week 130, her hunger scores increased to three to four points on the lower dose before returning to two points. 
 The results for this patient are shown in the figure below.

 In general, diet induced weight loss in patients with general obesity is accompanied by significant counter‑regulatory effects, including reductions in energy expenditure and increases in hunger. These lead to weight regain in the majority of patients. In contrast, the initial patient in our trial did not manifest these counter‑regulatory responses, even after six months of therapy and a tremendous reduction of body weight. This data supports an effect of setmelanotide on energy expenditure independent from the profound effects on hyperphagia, corroborating results from previous trials of setmelanotide in patients with general obesity. Also of note, the reduction in body weight was mainly due to a loss of body fat mass, and lean body mass was not greatly altered. In this initial patient, setmelanotide was also associated with excellent tolerability, additional favorable changes in cardiovascular risk parameters, or lipids, and improvements in blood pressure and heart rate.
 MC4R activation also causes improvements in glucose and insulin parameters in animal models, independent of weight loss. As shown in the figure below, for the initial patient in our POMC deficiency proof of concept trial, setmelanotide demonstrated a marked improvement in insulin resistance during treatment. While weight loss likely played an important role in this improvement, we believe the independent effect of MC4R agonism may also have contributed.

 Setmelanotide Treatment Effects on Insulin Resistance (Insulin Response in Oral Glucose Tolerance
 Test) at Baseline, After 13 Weeks of Treatment (Phase 1), and at Approximately 26 Weeks During the Long‑term Extension for our POMC Initial Patient

 Results are also available for treatment with setmelanotide of a second patient with POMC deficiency obesity. The second patient is a 26‑year old woman who also experienced early onset of obesity and hyperphagia. Like the first patient, in spite of significant efforts, she was never able to stabilize her body weight, and she has remained hyperphagic. Ahead of our trial, the patient’s self‑reported trial hunger score was nine out of 10 points, representing extreme hunger, and her weight and BMI at trial entry were 152.8 kg, or 336.9 lbs., and 54.1 kg/m2, respectively.
 After 42 weeks of therapy at the 1.5 mg/day dose, our second patient demonstrated weight loss of 40.6 kg, or 89.5 lbs., representing 26.6% of her initial body weight, with approximately two to three kilograms per week of weight loss demonstrated initially. Hunger scores, measured using a Likert score of zero to 10, where zero represents no hunger and 10 represents extreme hunger, mirrored the rate of weight loss, with scores moving from nine prior to the trial to one on most weeks during the trial, as the patient was treated with increasing doses of setmelanotide. Similar to the initial patient, setmelanotide demonstrated an improvement in insulin resistance during treatment in our second POMC deficiency obesity patient. This patient continued on active treatment for 64 weeks on therapy and her weight stabilized at a weight loss of 40.5 kg, or 89.3 lbs. However, a non‑serious febrile infection made an increase of the hydrocortisone treatment necessary. Due to a misunderstanding, this planned temporary elevated dosage of hydrocortisone was not returned to her basal dose of hydrocortisone after a few days as planned; as a result, her hunger feelings started to increase, with an associated increase in hunger score to 7 points, followed by weight gain. After adaptation of the hydrocortisone dosage during her next visit, the hunger feeling and weight decreased again and she has continued on treatment for 100 weeks in total.

 The Clinical Course of our Second Patient in the Setmelanotide POMC Deficiency Obesity Phase 2 Trial through Week 64(1)

 *             Figures represent cumulative weight lost in kgs through approximately 64 weeks of treatment.  See text for additional details.
 (1)           Daily setmelanotide dose adjustments over time are indicated at the top of the panel.
 Setmelanotide was generally well tolerated in the POMC deficiency obesity Phase 2 trial, with few adverse events, all mild and infrequent, and all previously reported in other clinical trials. These included reduced appetite and tanning of skin and nevi, or moles, intermittent and mild injection site reactions, and in rare instances tiredness, dry mouth, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The single serious adverse event was an influenza immunization reaction, which resulted in an overnight hospitalization and was considered unrelated to trial drug. A similar immunization reaction had occurred in this patient in a previous influenza immunization prior to treatment, and the patient has continued on setmelanotide since that event.
 The results from the initial patients in our POMC deficiency obesity proof of concept trial are compelling, but these data have limitations due to open label treatment. However, the strong treatment effect is supported by these patients’ long histories of weight gain and hyperphagia prior to treatment, and a strong dose response in the dose escalation phase. More importantly, the biology of this disorder has been well studied, and the clinical responses in these patients were strongly predicted by the deep understanding of the role of the MC4 pathway in appetite and weight regulation. The interruption of treatment effectively allowed the first patient to serve as her own control, demonstrating an immediate and rapid increase in hunger and weight after a short‑term treatment withdrawal, and a rapid response to re‑treatment, thereby further demonstrating the strong effect of setmelanotide. The greater than two years of treatment of our first patient, and the greater than one year of treatment for our second patient also support the ability of setmelanotide to be effective for longer treatment periods. Finally, our data supports that this indication will require chronic treatment.

 
  22

 

 Most importantly, this initial proof of concept data provides support for the belief that setmelanotide will restore activity in patients with upstream defects in the MC4 pathway, by helping patients lose weight and reduce hyperphagia. This was further supported by our other proof of concept results in MC4 pathway rare genetic obesities, such as LEPR deficiency obesity, Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome. Similarly, we would expect efficacy in other upstream MC4 pathway genetic disorders, others of which are under study in Phase 2 proof of concept trials.
 Phase 3 Clinical Development in POMC Deficiency Obesity
 After discussions with the FDA as part of our Breakthrough Therapy designation, we initiated our Phase 3 trial in POMC deficiency obesity in January 2017, Study RM‑493‑012. This is an open label, one‑year trial, including a double‑blind placebo‑controlled withdrawal period, of setmelanotide in POMC deficiency obesity. This pivotal trial is assessing long‑term efficacy of setmelanotide given once daily by SC injection. The trial begins with an initial period of dose titration lasting between two and 12 weeks where the individual patient’s therapeutic dose will be established by upwards dose titration in two week intervals. Thereafter, patients will continue on active treatment at their individually titrated optimal therapeutic dose for an additional 10 weeks, for a total combined dosing duration of 12 weeks at the individual patient’s therapeutic dose. Patients who demonstrate at least five kilograms weight loss at the end of the open label treatment period will continue onto the double‑blind, variably‑timed, placebo‑controlled, withdrawal period lasting eight weeks inclusive of a four‑week period of placebo treatment. Following the withdrawal period, all patients will complete an additional period of setmelanotide treatment to bring the total therapeutic dosing period to approximately one year.
 Based on discussions with the FDA, we plan to file an NDA with the FDA based on approximately one-year data from a pivotal cohort of 10 patients in this trial. We also are enrolling supplemental patients who may not complete one year of treatment at the time of NDA filing, including patients between six and eleven years of age under the implementation of a pediatric amendment, to provide additional important data regarding the use of setmelanotide in people living with POMC deficiency obesity.  The primary endpoint of the trial will be a categorical analysis of responders for weight, defined as patients achieving a 10% change from baseline, with mean percentage change in weight from baseline as the key secondary endpoint. Hunger-related endpoints are also key secondary endpoints in the study.  Other secondary endpoints are safety and tolerability, change in body fat mass and glucose parameters, and the effect of withdrawal of setmelanotide in the double‑blind, placebo controlled period. We have also obtained Scientific Advice from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in relation to the protocol for this trial, which is currently enrolling in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Belgium.
 We have completed enrollment of the pivotal cohort in June 2018 and we expect to report initial Phase 3 data from this pivotal trial in the third quarter of 2019.
 Phase 2 Clinical Development in LEPR Deficiency Obesity
 Leptin’s role in obesity has been elucidated by characterization of severely obese people with homozygous mutations that impair the activity of leptin, including disruption of signaling at the LEPR, known as LEPR deficiency obesity. To study setmelanotide in this indication we initially amended our Phase 2 clinical trial in POMC deficiency obesity, Study RM‑493‑011, to also include this new and related genetically defined population of severely obese patients. We then completed this part of the Phase 2 proof of concept, open label clinical trial in patients with LEPR deficiency obesity by treating three patients in this trial, who demonstrated weight loss and hunger reduction as outlined below.  The results of this trial were published in May 2018 in Nature Medicine, which we believe validates the scientific and clinical importance of our Phase 2 findings.
 Results from treatment with setmelanotide in these three LEPR deficiency obesity patients are available. The first LEPR deficiency obesity patient was a 23‑year old male, who experienced early onset of obesity and hyperphagia. After little success in controlling his weight, he underwent, and failed, a gastric banding procedure, and had regained over 20 kg in the last year since his procedure. Ahead of our trial, the patient’s self‑reported trial hunger score was nine out of 10 points, representing extreme hunger, and his weight and BMI at trial entry were 130.6 kg, or 287.9 lbs., and 39.9 kg/m2, respectively. After initiation and upwards dose titration over 13 weeks of setmelanotide treatment, the patient demonstrated prompt and striking reductions in appetite and body weight with a total loss of 17.5 kg body weight, representing 13.4% 

 
  23

 
of his initial body weight. Hunger scores decreased from nine points at baseline to one to two points at 13 weeks. With continued treatment for 26 weeks, the patient lost 28.2 kg, or 62.2 lbs., representing 21.6% of his initial body weight, and during that interval, he had a hunger score of one to two. Subsequently, on this dose, his weight has remained stable over an additional 35 weeks, with total weight loss of 25.1 kg or 55.3 lbs., representing 19.2% of his initial body weight over the 61 weeks of treatment. The weight loss was predominantly caused by a reduction in body fat and resting energy expenditure stayed stable during this period. This patient also had pre‑trial insulin levels that were elevated as examined by an oral glucose tolerance test, as were glucose values, demonstrating insulin resistance. These values improved with setmelanotide treatment. Notably, there was also an improvement in the patient’s lipid profile over 13 weeks of setmelanotide treatment. Setmelanotide was generally well tolerated in this LEPR deficiency obesity trial.

 (1)           Daily setmelanotide dose adjustments over time are indicated at the top of the panel.
 The second LEPR deficiency obesity patient is a 22‑year old male who also experienced early onset of obesity and hyperphagia. His growth curve since infancy demonstrated early onset, severe obesity that had continued through his whole life, with little ability to control his weight gain. Ahead of our trial, the patient’s self‑reported trial hunger score was nine to ten out of ten points, and his weight and BMI at trial entry were 122.1 kg, or 269.2 lbs., and 40.7 kg/m2, respectively. He was treated with setmelanotide and his dose was escalated up to 1.5 mg once daily with only modest effects on weight and hunger scores. However, when he was advanced to 2 mg once daily, he demonstrated prompt and striking reductions in appetite and body weight. After 17 weeks, including 11 weeks on his therapeutic dose of 2 mg/day, he had lost 9.6 kg, or 21.2 lbs., representing 7.9% of his body weight, and his hunger score dropped to two to three points. By 36 weeks of total treatment, he had lost 13.9 kg, or 30.6 lbs., representing 11.4% of his body weight. Despite good tolerance of treatment and this marked weight loss, the patient still felt dissatisfaction at the rate of weight loss and independently discontinued his setmelanotide administration for approximately 2 weeks. During this time he regained 5.2 kg or 11.5 lbs., and his hunger score increased to nine out of ten points, or severe hunger. The patient reported that he felt hungry every hour, and 

 
  24

 
was struggling to control his appetite. As a result, treatment was re‑initiated at the 2 mg dose, and was then increased to 2.5 mg per day with the goal of accelerating his weight loss. As a result, he demonstrated a significant reduction in hunger, with his hunger score decreasing from nine to two out of ten points, and a reduction in body weight. The patient remains on treatment with good tolerability. This patient had few metabolic abnormalities at baseline, but he was hyperinsulinemic as examined by an oral glucose tolerance test. After 13 weeks of treatment, the hyperinsulinemia started to improve and the blood glucose levels during the oral glucose tolerance test normalized.
 Our Second and Third Patients in the Setmelanotide LEPR Deficiency Obesity Phase 2 Trial(1)

 *             Figures show patient data only during weeks in which patients were in compliance with the trial protocol.
 (1)           Daily setmelanotide dose adjustments over time are indicated at the top of the panel.
 The third LEPR deficiency obesity patient is a 14‑year‑old female adolescent, and the first adolescent patient treated with setmelanotide. Her growth curve since infancy demonstrated early onset, severe obesity her whole life, with little ability to control her weight gain. Ahead of our trial, the patient’s self‑reported trial hunger score was nine out of 10 points, and her weight and BMI at trial entry were 120.4 kg, or 265.4 lbs., and 44.2 kg/m2, respectively. The patient lost 10 kg, or 22 lbs., representing 8.3% of her body weight, and her hunger score reduced to five out of 10 points in the first 13 weeks on a dose of 1.5 mg per day. Before and during treatment, the patient exhibited behavior that compromised compliance with the treatment regimen. This manifested as a misunderstanding that led her to perform the injections late in the afternoon and at an incorrect, lower dosage of 1.0 mg setmelanotide. Considering that we have noted a dose threshold for therapeutic benefit and SC setmelanotide injections have a 10‑ to 12‑hour half‑life, we concluded that the combination of a lower dose and the occurrence of the highest drug concentration at night most likely precipitated an interval of weight regain. In support of this explanation, her feeling of hunger was reduced during the night but started to increase during the day. Eventually, these errors were reported and corrected. Following such correction, careful monitoring was instituted to ensure that the patient performed the injections in the morning as instructed, leading again to reduced hunger.

 This trial provides the second proof of concept for the effectiveness of setmelanotide in patients with upstream defects in the MC4 pathway, showing marked weight reduction and decreases in hunger in patients with LEPR deficiency obesity. In addition, the efficacy of the drug correlates well with periods of setmelanotide treatment and withdrawal, as in POMC deficiency obesity. Based on this proof of concept for the compelling efficacy of setmelanotide in this disorder, and the FDA granting of Breakthrough Therapy designation, we transitioned the LEPR development program to Phase 3.
 Phase 3 Clinical Development in LEPR Deficiency Obesity
 Our LEPR deficiency obesity development program is now in Phase 3. We have completed enrollment of the 10 patients in the pivotal cohort in the second quarter of 2018 and we expect to report initial Phase 3 data from this pivotal trial in the third quarter of 2019. This is an open label, one‑year trial, including a double‑blind placebo‑controlled withdrawal period, of setmelanotide in LEPR deficiency obesity. This pivotal trial will assess long‑term efficacy of setmelanotide given once daily by SC injection in LEPR deficiency obesity, and is planned to be of very similar design to the Phase 3 ongoing trial in POMC deficiency obesity. The trial begins with an initial period of dose titration lasting between two and 12 weeks where the individual patient’s therapeutic dose will be established by upwards dose titration in two‑week intervals. Thereafter, patients continue on active treatment at their individually titrated optimal therapeutic dose for an additional 10 weeks, for a total combined dosing duration of 12 weeks at the individual patient’s therapeutic dose. Patients who demonstrate at least five kilograms weight loss at the end of the open label treatment period will continue onto the double‑blind, variably‑timed, placebo‑controlled, withdrawal period. Following the withdrawal period, all patients will complete an additional period of setmelanotide treatment to bring the total therapeutic dosing period to approximately one year.
 We have completed enrollment of the pivotal cohort of 10 patients in this trial, aged 12 years and older. We also are enrolling supplemental patients, who may not complete one year of treatment at the time of NDA filing, including patients between six and eleven years of age under the implementation of a pediatric amendment, to provide additional important data regarding the use of setmelanotide in people living with LEPR deficiency obesity.
 Completion of enrollment for the pivotal cohort in this Phase 3 trial was contemporaneous with completion of enrollment for our POMC deficiency obesity pivotal trial, and so we are planning to file an NDA for each of these indications concurrently.
 The primary and key secondary endpoints will be identical to those for our POMC deficiency obesity pivotal trial. This trial is currently being conducted in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Netherlands, and Germany. Based on the FDA granting Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of obesity associated with genetic defects upstream of the MC4 receptor in the leptin‑melanocortin pathway, which includes the LEPR deficiency obesity indication, we believe we can seek indications for this type of obesity with a faster path to approval, as compared to typical obesity drug candidates, because of the high unmet need and rare prevalence of this disorder.
 Phase 2 Clinical Development in Bardet‑Biedl Syndrome
 Bardet‑Biedl syndrome is a life‑threatening, orphan disease with prevalence of approximately one in 100,000 in North America. We estimate that the addressable patient population for Bardet‑Biedl syndrome is approximately 1,500 to 2,500 patients in the United States. It is a rare monogenic disorder that causes severe obesity and hyperphagia as well as vision loss, polydactyly, kidney abnormalities, and other signs and symptoms. Bardet‑Biedl syndrome is part of a class of disorders called ciliopathies, or disorders associated with the impairment of cilia function in cells. Cilia are hair‑like cellular projections that play a fundamental role in the regulation of several biological processes, including satiety signaling. Cilia dysfunction is thought to contribute to hyperphagia and obesity in Bardet‑Biedl syndrome. Bardet‑Biedl syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disease that is caused by as many as 21 separate Bardet‑Biedl loci defects resulting in a similar syndrome, though each Bardet‑Biedl syndrome patient only has one of these defects.
 The role of abnormal cilia development and function in obesity has been elucidated in animal models, most strongly for Bardet‑Biedl syndrome. Studies in mouse models of Bardet‑Biedl syndrome show that deficiencies in the MC4 pathway contribute to the obesity and hyperphagia in Bardet‑Biedl syndrome, with animals developing hyperphagic tendencies early in life. Notably, these mice have decreased leptin receptor signaling, with the essential hallmarks of failure 

 
  26

 
to activate POMC neurons. This is supported in Bardet‑Biedl syndrome rodent models, where the mice respond to an MC4 agonist resulting in reduced food intake and body weight. The relation of Bardet‑Biedl syndrome gene mutations to the MC4 pathway is supported by clinical data. Patients with Bardet‑Biedl syndrome have higher leptin than expected for their degree of adiposity, or leptin resistance, which is consistent with the notion that ciliopathy‑induced leptin signaling dysfunction is associated with leptin resistance.
 Overall, these data support that the phenotypes of these ciliopathies, while complex with additional clinically important features along with obesity and hyperphagia, may be responsive to setmelanotide treatment, and will be investigated in our proof of concept Phase 2 trial.
 We are studying Bardet‑Biedl syndrome patients who are severely obese, and have provided proof of concept that Bardet‑Biedl syndrome patients will also demonstrate decreased hunger and significant weight loss, similar to that seen in patients with POMC deficiency obesity, or LEPR deficiency obesity. We have enrolled the first five patients in this trial, have reported preliminary results for these patients in a presentation at the Obesity Week 2017 meeting, and updated the clinical status of these patients in June 2018. In the second quarter of 2018, the FDA agreed to include Bardet‑Biedl syndrome under our existing Breakthrough Therapy designation for setmelanotide. We have had ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding a Phase 3 trial and initiated this trial and began to enroll patients in December 2018. The FDA has indicated that this Phase 3 trial will include both Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome patients.
 For the Phase 2 trial, additional assessments of hunger using daily hunger scores and questionnaires were also obtained. We are using these new assessments in all our ongoing Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials and for future trials. These new assessments are as follows:

· | Daily Hunger Scores. In addition to our morning assessment of hunger, as performed in the Phase 2 trials in POMC deficiency obesity and LEPR deficiency obesity, we are also obtaining a daily hunger score rating in response to the question: “In the last 24 hours, how hungry did you feel when you were the most hungry?” Patients are asked to give a response that is measured on a scale of 0‑10, whereby 0 points signifies “not hungry at all” and 10 points indicates the patient feels his or her “hungriest possible.”
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Questionnaires. For patients 16 years of age and younger, we are using two observer related questionnaires as exploratory endpoints. These questionnaires are completed by the patient’s parent or other caregiver.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Food Problem Diary, or FPD, is based on food‑related behaviors. This questionnaire was adapted from a similar questionnaire that was used with patients with Prader‑Willi syndrome. The questionnaire is rated on a 30‑point scale where 30 points is strong evidence of hyperphagia and 0 points is evidence of no hyperphagia. The best possible response therefore is 0 points.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Significant Event Questionnaire, or SEQ, counts events not typically seen in this population, such as a patient leaving food on his or her plate at a meal. This questionnaire consists of eight “yes” or “no” questions. The best possible response is 8 points, since this questionnaire tracks events and behavior not typically seen in patients with MC4 pathway disorders. In contrast with other score scales, a higher score in this hunger assessment category represents improvement, and thus, the results are plotted in reverse scale and downward trends indicate improvement.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that proof of concept in Bardet‑Biedl syndrome has been demonstrated by improvements in hunger and weight reduction, supporting that this is a setmelanotide‑responsive, MC4 pathway disorder. The age of the patients ranged from 12 to 61 years. The starting weights of the patients ranged from 51.3 to 162.7 kg and BMI ranged from 37 to 51. The starting hunger scores for the adult patients ranged from 6 to 9 points on the 10‑point scale, with higher scores indicating more hunger and the SEQ scores for the two adolescent patients were 1, and 2 for a third adolescent patient.

      Three patients with Bardet‑Biedl syndrome type 1 mutations and one each with Bardet‑Biedl syndrome types 2, 4, 5, 10, 12 mutations and one patient with a BBS mutation that was not established were enrolled. Total treatment durations lasted between 41 and 65 weeks. Six of the nine patients showed clinically important, marked weight loss of 27.0 kg, 14.1 kg, 24.2 kg, 13.7 kg, 13.7 kg and 21.2 kg, or 59.5 lbs., 31.1 lbs., 53.4 lbs., 30.2 lbs., 30.2 lbs. and 46.7 lbs. respectively, and a decrease of 18.3%, 14.2%, 19.9%, 11.2%, 15.5% and 21.6%, respectively. Hunger scores were reduced by 44.4%, 85.7%, 100.0%, 66.0%, 21.0% and 66.7%, respectively, in these six patients. Summary of the data is shown below and with six out of nine patients showing efficacy of > 10% weight loss supported moving into phase 3.

 The fifth patient, a patient with a Bardet‑Biedl syndrome type 1 mutation, showed marked improvement in hunger scores with a 53.3% decrease, but did not demonstrate any body weight change after 33 weeks on treatment, including a final 12‑week test period on 3.0 mg daily. However, the weight curve for this patient indicated a slowing of prior childhood weight gain upon treatment with setmelanotide, as indicated with an arrow in her pediatric growth chart, below. This patient was a 12‑year‑old with Type 1 diabetes who entered the trial with extremely poor glucose control, with an average blood sugar level, or HbA1c, of 10.1%. We have been investigating the reason for the inconsistency between her improvement in hunger and lack of weight loss. During her treatment, her HbA1c showed an improvement to 7.6%. Following treatment discontinuation, the patient gained 5.9 kg, appetite and hunger returned to baseline levels and HbA1c increased to 11.7%.  
 Overall setmelanotide was generally well tolerated in all patients in this Bardet‑Biedl syndrome Phase 2 proof of concept study.  Adverse events associated with setmelanotide treatment included increased pigmentation of the skin/nvi and mild injection site reactions.  No discontinuations were due to adverse events.  No serious adverse events were reported in BBS patients.  No clinically significant detrimental changes in blood pressure or heart rate have been reported.  

 Phase 2 Proof of Concept Study of Patients with Alström Syndrome
 We are conducting a Phase 2, proof of concept trial in Alström syndrome, which is a life‑threatening, ultra‑rare orphan disease with a prevalence of approximately one in 1,000,000 in North America and we estimate that the addressable patient population for Alström syndrome obesity is approximately 500 to 1,000 patients worldwide. Alström syndrome shares many clinical features with Bardet‑Biedl syndrome, including obesity and hyperphagia, and is also characterized by progressive vision loss, deafness, congestive heart failure, hyperinsulinemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Similarly, 

 
  30

 
Alström syndrome is a ciliopathy caused by mutations in the ALMS1 gene, which has also been shown to be important for cilia function. Like Bardet‑Biedl syndrome, recent scientific studies identify genetic deficiencies affecting the MC4 signaling pathway as a potential cause of the obesity and hyperphagia associated with Alström syndrome. Studies in a mouse model of Alström syndrome show a reduction in the number of cilia in specific neurons in the hypothalamus that are critical for MC4 pathway signaling. While Alström syndrome is less well studied than Bardet‑Biedl syndrome, the similar pathophysiology of cilial dysfunction and clinical presentation support that deficiencies in the MC4 pathway are implicated in the obesity and hyperphagia observed in Alström syndrome. Therefore, we hypothesize that setmelanotide treatment can be applied to treat Alström syndrome.
 We are studying Alström syndrome patients who are severely obese. We believe, our initial proof of concept data, shown below, demonstrates that Alström syndrome patients may also experience decreased hunger and significant weight loss similar to that seen in patients with POMC deficiency obesity, LEPR deficiency obesity, or Bardet‑Biedl syndrome. We have enrolled patients in this trial and have updated the clinical status of these patients in June 2018. The FDA has also recently included Alström syndrome under our existing Breakthrough Therapy designation. As mentioned for Bardet‑Biedl syndrome, we have had ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding a Phase 3 trial and initiated this trial and started to enroll patients in December 2018. The FDA has indicated that this Phase 3 trial will include both Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome patients.
 As of October 2018, four Alström syndrome patients have been treated with setmelanotide in the Phase 2 study.  The age of the patients range from 12 to 21 years.  The starting weights of the patients range from 70.7 to 108.1 kg and BMI ranged from 28 to 47.  The starting hunger scores for the adult patients ranged from 2 to 7 points on the 10-point scale.
 The initial Alström syndrome patient in our Phase 2 clinical trial was a 12‑year‑old male, starting weight of 78.6 kg, or 173.2 lbs., with a BMI of 28.2 kg/m2 (above the 98th percentile for his age). At baseline, his initial “worst hunger” score was 5.5 points, and his morning hunger score was 5 points. As of October 2018, this patient has been treated for 56 weeks including titration, most of that time on a dose of 2 mg/day. During the course of 56 weeks of treatment, he experienced weight loss of 16.4 kg, or 36.2 lbs., which represented a 20.9% weight loss and a 45.5% decrease in hunger. Clinical assessment by the Dykens hyperphagia questionnaire, another instrument also collected in this patient only, demonstrated a baseline of 31 out of 55 possible points, which improved to 11 points, or a 64.5% improvement in 

 
  31

 
hyperphagia. Because his body weight was approaching ideal body weight, and he is a growing child, his dose was reduced to 1.5 mg/day, at 32 weeks and 0.5 mg six days/week at 50 weeks, with stabilization of his weight.

     Three additional Alström patients (2 adolescents, 1 adult) have been enrolled in this Phase 2 study and the data is summarized below. One of these patients is showing promising responses in weight loss and hunger, one is too early to determine, but one patient, the adult, did not show improvements in either weight or hunger and was discontinued.

Alström Syndrome Patient Number | Weight loss(kg) | Weight loss(lbs.) | Weight loss(%) | Change inhunger score(Start/End)
1........................................................... | 16.4 | 36.2 | 21.0% | 6/3 
2........................................................... | 3.8 | 8.4 | 5.4% | 7/2 
3........................................................... | 1.1 | 4.6 | 1.1% | NA 
4........................................................... | 5.0 | 11.2 | 5.5% | 2/5 

      Overall, setmelanotide was generally well tolerated in all patients in this Alström syndrome Phase 2 proof of concept study. Adverse events associated with setmelanotide treatment included increased pigmentation of the skin/nevi and injection site reactions. No serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events were reported. No clinically significant increases in blood pressure were observed that resulted in the development of hypertension.
 Phase 3 Clinical Development in Bardet‑Biedl and Alström Syndrome
 Since the FDA agreed to include Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome under our Breakthrough Therapy designation, we began in May 2018 an ongoing discussion about Phase 3 trial design with the FDA, and have received preliminary guidance on many aspects of the Phase 3 development programs in Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome. Based on these discussions, we are started a combined Phase 3 study to include both Bardet‑Biedl and Alström patients in a single Phase 3 trial, including at least 20 Bardet‑Biedl syndrome patients and at least six Alström syndrome 

 
  32

 
patients, aged six years and older. The combined trial is likely to lead to a more rapid path for approval of these two indications than two separate trials. Like previous setmelanotide Phase 3 trials in POMC and LEPR deficiency obesities, we are planning an open label, approximately one‑year trial, assessing long term efficacy of setmelanotide given once daily by SC injection. We may also plan to enroll supplemental patients who may not complete one year of treatment at the time of NDA filing. We expect to discuss with the FDA the primary endpoint of the trial. Potential endpoints will likely include a categorical analysis of responders for weight, with mean percentage change in weight from baseline as a key secondary endpoint. Hunger‑related endpoints are also likely to be key secondary endpoints in the study.
 We are planning the trial to begin with an initial period of dose titration, using a simplified titration scheme over two weeks for adults, and possibly slightly longer for pediatric patients. This trial may include a short, 12‑week, randomized, placebo‑controlled period. Following the 12‑week, double‑blind, placebo controlled period, all patients will complete an additional period of active setmelanotide treatment to complete the approximately one‑year trial. We are also discussing with the FDA a potential alternative primary endpoint for growing pediatric patients that will capture the therapeutic benefits of setmelanotide in the pediatric population.
 We have continued ongoing discussion with the FDA, completed the Phase 3 protocol, initiated the Phase 3 study and enrolled our first patients in December of 2018. This study will be conducted in both the United States and Europe.
 Phase 2 Proof of Concept Studies Focused on Patients with Monogenic Disorders of the MC4 Pathway: Heterozygous Mutations in the MC4 Pathway and Epigenetic Disorders of the MC4 Pathway
 We are conducting Phase 2, proof of concept trials in a variety of monogenic, upstream disorders of the MC4 pathway, including POMC and other MC4 pathway gene heterozygous mutations, and epigenetic disorders of the MC4 pathway. These trials are Phase 2 open label, single arm, proof of concept trials assessing the effect of setmelanotide on the rare genetic disorders of obesity described below. We hypothesize that these disorders may be genetically‑defined deficiencies upstream in the MC4 pathway. Each trial includes a three‑month proof of concept phase at which weight loss, hunger and other metabolic parameters will be evaluated. If patients demonstrate significant weight loss and acceptable safety and tolerability, they will continue treatment for evaluation of setmelanotide’s effects for a total of one year. Similar to our previous trials, this trial begins with an initial period of dose titration where the individual patient’s therapeutic dose is established by upwards dose titration in two week intervals. We plan to enroll from 20 up to 100 patients between these two rare genetic populations. We are conducting these trials, as we did for the ongoing Bardet‑Biedl syndrome and Alström syndrome Phase 2 trial described above, under basket protocols, which are designed to capture a broad range of patient populations to be treated under one investigational protocol. We believe this approach is efficient for studying many potential indications, and we intend to add additional populations to these basket protocols over the next one to two years.
 The genetic disorders we are studying in our additional Phase 2 proof of concept trials are outlined below, and initial, preliminary Phase 2 data for each indication is summarized.
 a.Clinical Development in MC4 Pathway Heterozygous Deficiency Obesity
 MC4 pathway heterozygous deficiency obesity is caused by the loss of one of the two genetic copies of either the genes for POMC, PCSK, LEPR, or other genes in the MC4 pathway. Animal models support that such heterozygous deficiency in the critical leptin‑melanocortin pathway can result in a strong predisposition to severe obesity. The effect of genetic heterozygous deficiency obesity was first demonstrated for another gene in the MC4 pathway: MC4R heterozygous deficiency obesity. Later data also supported that POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity also results in a strong predisposition to obesity, though the epidemiology and clinical characterization of these patients is less well known. An estimated 2% of severe, early onset obesity patients have POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity, which is much more common than the ultra‑rare POMC deficiency obesity in which both copies of either the POMC or PCSK genes are impaired. Our initial clinical focus is on the most severely obese MC4 pathway heterozygous patients to test the hypothesis that severely obese heterozygous POMC patients might also respond substantially to setmelanotide treatment.
 We are studying patients who are severely obese, or whose BMI is equal to or greater than 40kg/m2, and who are heterozygous deficient for POMC, LEPR, or other genes in the MC4 pathway. These patients have a 

 
  33

 
heterozygous genetic mutation resulting in full or partial loss of MC4 pathway signaling to the downstream MC4R. The purpose of studying these patients in this trial is to provide proof of concept that severely impaired MC4 pathway heterozygous deficiency obesity patients will also demonstrate significant weight loss, similar to though possibly of less magnitude, as that seen in patients with POMC deficiency obesity or LEPR deficiency obesity. We are enrolling this trial at sites in the United States and Europe, and reported initial, preliminary results in June 2018.
 Five heterozygous patients have been enrolled, mostly for short durations, in this Phase 2 trial. The longest treated patient, on treatment for 34 weeks including titration, is showing promising responses in weight loss of 23.1 kg, or 50.9 lbs. which represented a 15.4% decrease in body weight, and also showed an 80% decrease in hunger score. A second patient has shown 9.5 kg, or 21.0 lbs. of weight loss, which represented a 6.5% decrease in body weight, and also showed a moderate 20% decrease in hunger score. One patient did not show improvements in either weight or hunger and was discontinued due to lack of efficacy, and two patients discontinued early due to tolerability issues related to muscle cramps or tanning, respectively. Four of the five patients treated to date were enrolled at a single site. We are currently opening a number of additional sites with relevant pre‑identified heterozygous patients in their databases.
 POMC heterozygous deficiency obesity is complex in many ways, in that there appears to be variable penetrance, or manifestation of heterozygous mutations. As a result, we intend to study a larger number of heterozygous patients in Phase 2, to more carefully delineate those patients most debilitated and those who will have the best response to setmelanotide, before we discuss the design for a Phase 3 study with the FDA. We intend to provide an update on a larger number of heterozygous patients in the first quarter of 2019.
 Mutations that are of particular interest include mutations to the section of the POMC gene that are translated into the protein, beta‑melanocyte stimulating hormone, or β‑MSH. These mutations have been implicated in human and canine obesity. In 2002, researchers identified one specific heterozygote mutation of β‑MSH, called the R236G mutation, in two children with extreme childhood obesity. This R236G mutation results in an abnormal β‑MSH protein with a markedly reduced ability to activate the MC4R itself, and may also prevent other natural MC4R ligands from activating the MC4R. These combined effects may result in more significant obesity than other heterozygous mutations. The overall prevalence of this mutation is rare, 0.7% of the obese population is estimated to carry this mutation, but our genotyping study of 560 patients with early onset, childhood obesity has identified five heterozygote patients with the R236G mutation, all with severe obesity. This mutation may be a focus when enrolling our Phase 2 trial in POMC heterozygous obesity. We are studying patients who are heterozygous deficient for other genes in the MC4 pathway, though less is known about the epidemiology and clinical impact of these other heterozygous deficiency obesities. We have also hypothesized that patients who carry high allelic burden in this pathway, or who have genetic disorders in two or more of the genes of the MC4 pathway, and who therefore might have some impairment at more than one location in the MC4 pathway, might also be responsive to setmelanotide.
 b.Clinical Development in Patients with Epigenetic Changes at the POMC receptor
 In our proof of concept Phase 2 trials, we are studying patients suffering from obesity due to a partial lack of MSH due to an epigenetic POMC variant. Epigenetics changes are DNA modifications that can change gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. The most stable epigenetic modification is called DNA methylation. Recently, our academic collaborators in Berlin have described a POMC hypermethylation variant, which correlates with increased body weight in children and adults. Therefore, the presence of the POMC genetic/epigenetic variant leads to an increased risk for obesity based on reduced POMC gene activity. We expect that these patients under express the POMC gene product and as a result have a partial MSH deficiency.
 There is convincing evidence that such epigenetic variants are potentially major factors for an increased individual risk to develop obesity later in life, and we hypothesize that the most obese patients in their populations may benefit from treatment with setmelanotide. However, epigenetic variation is likely not the only reason for the development of obesity in this patient group, because these variants are also observed in normal weight 

 
  34

 
individuals, although to a lesser extent. At this point, no epidemiology data is available to estimate the size of the POMC epigenetic deficiency obese population.
 We are studying patients who are severely obese, or whose BMI is equal to or greater than 40kg/m2, and who have hypermethylation at the POMC gene. The purpose of studying these patients in this trial is to provide proof of concept that severely impaired, epigenetic POMC variant obesity patients will also demonstrate significant weight loss similar to, though possibly of less magnitude, as that seen in patients with POMC deficiency obesity or LEPR deficiency obesity. We are enrolling this trial at sites in the United States and Europe, and reported initial, preliminary results in June 2018.
 Two epigenetic patients have been enrolled, one of whom is just starting titration. The longer treated patient, on treatment for 27 weeks including titration, is a 20‑year‑old female, with a starting weight of 182.2 kg, or 401.7 lbs., and a BMI of 55.0 kg/m2. Her starting hunger score was 7.5 points. As she was titrated, her hunger score decreased 60% to three points and she began to lose weight. Due to a vacation, she withdrew from treatment for approximately four weeks and her hunger score returned to baseline but she did not regain weight over that period. With resumption of treatment, her hunger score decreased to 3.5 points, and at week 27, she had lost 16.8 kg, or 37.0 lbs., which represented a loss of 9.2% of body weight.
 Phase 1b Clinical Development in Patients with Heterozygous MC4R Gene Mutations
 Early studies in downstream MC4 pathway defects demonstrated good efficacy and tolerability, and served as a foundation for potentially greater efficacy in upstream MC4 pathway deficiencies. We established proof of concept for efficacy of setmelanotide in patients with an MC4R heterozygous genetic mutation in one cohort of patients in our Phase 1b clinical trial. This clinical trial was a double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, randomized Phase 1b clinical trial designed to evaluate the effect of setmelanotide on weight loss and safety in obese patients with a heterozygous mutation of the MC4R gene. The initial cohort of eight patients was treated for four weeks with setmelanotide or placebo. The setmelanotide group showed weight loss of 3.48 kg, or 7.67 lbs., approximately 2.62 kg, or 5.78 lbs., more weight loss than the placebo group, which showed weight loss of 0.85 kg, or 1.87 lbs. Other parameters supporting weight loss were also positively impacted by setmelanotide. We believe that these results support the hypothesis that setmelanotide can be effective in weight loss in MC4R deficient patients, and provide evidence of the minimum expected treatment effect of setmelanotide, approximately 0.9 kg/week, or 1.98 lbs./week, of weight loss over four weeks, even in a situation where setmelanotide’s action is on a downstream MC4 pathway that is no longer fully functional due to heterozygous MC4R mutations. However, our focus is on upstream disorders of the MC4 pathway where we hypothesize that setmelanotide can serve as replacement therapy and provide more compelling efficacy.

 In general, we consider a p‑value of 0.05 to be significant. P‑values are an indication of statistical significance reflecting the probability of an observation occurring due to chance alone. However, it is not possible to determine a p‑value for very small sample sizes, such as one‑ or two‑patient trials. Other Clinical and Scientific Initiatives in Genetic Obesity
 Genotyping Study
 Leveraging new understanding of severe obesity caused by specific genetic defects has the potential to improve both diagnosis and treatment for specific types of life‑threatening obesity. We have expanded our genotyping study—the Genetic Obesity ID | Genotyping Study—in which eligible patients are genotyped for rare genetic disorders of obesity. The goal is to develop a screening algorithm for selecting patients to be genotyped and identified  with POMC deficiency obesity and LEPR deficiency obesity, and to guide further genotyping efforts; in addition, it is our expectation that patients who can participate in our clinical trials will be genetically identified. We are currently including approximately 100 genes which, in medical and scientific literature, have been associated with obesity, including other genes associated with the MC4 pathway. Individuals may enter the study through one of three arms including: a history of severe, early onset obesity, along with hyperphagia, high BMI, and individuals within three months of bariatric surgery. The study is currently 

 
  36

 
enrolling in the United States and Europe and is expected to expand to a total of 140 sites worldwide.  We plan to work with these investigators to publish the results of this study and guidance on the use of the algorithm for screening, to enable more systematic diagnoses of these rare genetic disorders of obesity.
 Unique Mechanism of Action of Setmelanotide at the MC4R

We recently published new molecular evidence of setmelanotide action on MC4R in Nature Medicine in May 2018, which demonstrates a unique mechanism of action compared to the endogenous activator, MSH, and first generation MC4R agonists. With agonism of the MC4R, setmelanotide appears to use different signaling pathways inside the MC4R cell, and to better compete away the natural antagonist at MC4R (AgRP). This may explain the remarkable efficacy of setmelanotide for appetite control in individuals with severe hyperphagia, and may also suggest why setmelanotide does not clinically increase blood pressure or heart rate, compared to former MC4R agonists. Further research in this area is planned as well.
 Setmelanotide: Clinical Development Program in Prader‑Willi Syndrome
 PWS is a life threatening, orphan multigenic disease with prevalence estimates ranging from approximately one in 8,000 to one in 52,000, with at least 8,000 diagnosed patients in the United States. A hallmark of PWS is hyperphagia, leading to severe obesity and other complications. For PWS patients, hyperphagia and obesity are the greatest threats to their health, and these patients are likely to die prematurely as a result of choking, stomach rupture, or from complications caused by morbid obesity.
 The genetics of PWS are complex, involving many genes on chromosome 15 that are not properly expressed. Recent discoveries highlight that a defect in one of these, the melanoma antigen family L2, or MAGEL2, gene, in rodent models impairs the function of POMC neurons, which are key components of the MC4 pathway. Studies have suggested a link between defects in MAGEL2 in some humans with obesity, hyperphagia, autism spectrum disorders, reduced intellectual ability and most other aspects of behavior and metabolism associated with PWS. However, the connection of PWS with the MC4 pathway is complex.
 We have completed a Phase 2 proof of concept, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, randomized clinical trial in PWS, Study RM‑493‑010, which enrolled 40 patients for four weeks of active setmelanotide treatment, administered once daily by SC injection. This trial was intended to assess the effects of setmelanotide on weight reduction, and PWS‑specific hyperphagia‑related behaviors, as PWS patients do not respond to hunger questionnaires, as well as determine its safety profile. Based on the data from this Phase 2 clinical trial, we do not believe we will be positioned to proceed directly into a Phase 3 clinical trial.
 The trial included a two‑week run‑in period, a four‑week double blind, randomized, placebo‑controlled parallel group main trial, a two‑week double‑blind, randomized, placebo‑controlled withdrawal period during which half of the trial patients were randomized to either continue to receive their therapy or be switched to the alternative therapy, from active to placebo, or vice versa, and a two‑week active‑treatment extension. There were four treatment arms in the trial: placebo (N=14); 0.5 mg of setmelanotide SC injection daily (N=4), 1.5 mg of setmelanotide SC injection daily (N=12), and 2.5 mg of setmelanotide SC injection daily (N=10). Patients were 17 to 54 years of age, with a mean BMI of 39.4 kg/m2, and with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of PWS. Primary endpoints for the trial included safety and tolerability, weight loss and hyperphagia, with hyperphagia to be measured by a PWS hyperphagia observer reported outcome, or ORO, questionnaire. Secondary endpoints included dual‑energy x‑ray absorptiometry measurements, pharmacokinetics, effects during the randomized withdrawal stage, and effects on quality of life and food‑related and other behaviors. Primary evaluations were assessed at the end of the four‑week double blind parallel group stage, as well as after the withdrawal stage and open label extension.
 The results of the trial showed modest effects on hyperphagia, which did not approach statistical significance, and no effect on weight, though there may have been some small evidence of clinically‑important weight loss in the very small group of patients who were randomized to the highest dose of setmelanotide over the longest interval of treatment (N=4 patients, post‑hoc evaluation, non‑significant). There was good safety and tolerability, providing support for the 2.5 mg daily dose, with only injection site reactions common in both active and placebo groups. There were no serious adverse 

 
  37

 
events, no significant safety issues or changes in labs or other safety parameters, and the one discontinuation was due to injection site reactions.
 PWS is a complex multigenic disease, and the hypothesis that PWS is an upstream MC4 pathway disorder is supported primarily on the role of only one of those genes, MAGEL2, in animal models of obesity. Our results may support that PWS is not an upstream MC4 pathway disorder. Alternatively, other design factors may have influenced the outcome of this trial, and we have started initial planning for future Phase 2 trials in PWS that address these potential factors: longer duration of treatment, younger patient population, improved setmelanotide pharmacokinetics, consideration of higher doses, and operational limitations of the completed Phase 2 trial.
 In addition to our plans to further evaluate setmelanotide in PWS, we also plan to pursue the development of RM‑853, our preclinical candidate GOAT inhibitor for PWS. Additionally, given setmelanotide and RM‑853’s distinct mechanisms of action, we plan to explore opportunities to evaluate the two compounds in combination, as we believe there may be complementary effects.
 Setmelanotide Clinical Development in General Obesity Patients
 Initial studies in general obesity provided preliminary evidence of efficacy and of good tolerability, and served as a foundation for the clinical development of setmelanotide. The general obese population is defined as having a BMI of equal to or greater than 30 kg/m2. In our initial clinical trials, we delivered setmelanotide with continuous SC infusion using an insulin pump. More recently, our administration has been converted to a once daily SC injectable formulation. In addition, we have an ongoing trial to assess the pharmacokinetics of a new, long‑acting formulation of setmelanotide.
 The table below summarizes the setmelanotide studies that we conducted in general obese patients under IND # 112595 submitted to the Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, FDA.

 Phase 2 Clinical Development in the General Obese Population
 a.Phase 2 Clinical Trial Results with Continuous Infusion
 We conducted our first Phase 2 clinical trial of setmelanotide using continuous SC infusion. This was a 12‑week, Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trial in general obese patients using the SC continuous infusion formulation of setmelanotide delivered by an insulin pump. We treated approximately 74 obese patients with either placebo or setmelanotide at a dose of 1.0 mg over 24 hours, with no serious adverse events or other safety indications from laboratory tests, electrocardiograms or vital signs noted in the setmelanotide treatment group. Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics, or blood levels, of setmelanotide from this clinical trial demonstrated that the SC continuous infusion method of drug administration was not optimal. A large number of patients did not meet the target pharmacokinetic exposures of setmelanotide that our Phase 1 clinical trials suggested would have to be achieved in order for setmelanotide to show efficacy. This clinical trial did not demonstrate statistically significant weight loss compared to the placebo. We believe patients in this clinical trial lacked adequate exposure to setmelanotide, and concluded that all future efficacy clinical trials in obese patients should be conducted using 

 
  39

 
the SC injection method. This belief is based on a prior Phase 1 pharmacokinetic trial, which used the SC injection formulation and demonstrated higher pharmacokinetic exposures in obese patients.
 b.Phase 2 Clinical Trial with Once Daily SC Injection
 We conducted a three‑stage, randomized, placebo‑controlled, Phase 2 12‑week general obesity trial, with approximately 100 obese patients, using our SC injection formulation, primarily with once daily dosing. We designed this Phase 2 clinical trial to bridge between the earlier clinical trials that used continuous infusion and all future clinical trials that use the formulation for once daily SC injection. Therefore, the primary purpose of the staged approach in this trial was to assess if appropriate pharmacokinetic targets could be reached with the new SC injection, first in an in‑patient setting similar to the setting where robust weight loss was demonstrated in the Phase 1 general obesity trial, and then in an outpatient setting.
 Overall, setmelanotide demonstrated significant weight loss over 12‑weeks in all stages, with placebo subtracted weight loss, or the difference in the amount of weight gained or lost in the active treatment group as compared to the placebo treatment group, from baseline of −2.78% to −4.69% and p‑values ranging from 0.005 to <0.001. However, weight loss was more pronounced and consistent in the cohort treated with an initial four‑week, observed dosing, inpatient period, for which overall placebo subtracted weight loss from baseline at week 12 ranged from −3.87% to −4.69%, all with p‑values of less than 0.005, with the most pronounced weight loss during the in‑patient period. The once daily SC injection formulation also showed consistent and predictable pharmacokinetic measurements during the four‑week inpatient interval in the first stage, validating the characteristics of the SC injection formulation. However, this trial demonstrated challenges in drug administration and compliance when administered in an outpatient setting in the general obese population.

 Phase 1 Clinical Development in the General Obese Population
 We have completed a Phase 1 single‑ascending dose, or SAD, clinical trial of setmelanotide, as well as five cohorts in a Phase 1 multiple‑ascending dose, or MAD, clinical trial of setmelanotide. Both clinical trials were in healthy obese subjects, and included a double‑blind, placebo‑controlled randomized escalating dose design. Subjects received 

 
  40

 
treatment in these Phase 1 clinical trials for one day at doses up to 0.1 mg/kg/day, which is a total daily dose of approximately 10 mg/day, and for up to 28 days at doses up to 0.015 mg/kg/day, which is a total daily dose of approximately 1.5 mg/day.
 In the SAD clinical trial, our extensive monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure did not demonstrate any clinically meaningful changes with setmelanotide treatment compared with placebo. Similarly, in the MAD clinical trial, there was no evidence of any notable changes in cardiovascular parameters compared to placebo when assessed by 24‑hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, or ABPM. We determined that the terminal half‑life of setmelanotide is approximately nine to ten hours, making it suitable for once daily dosing.
 Four cohorts of the Phase 1 MAD clinical trial that included doses of greater than 0.01 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 1 mg/day, for two to four weeks, demonstrated placebo subtracted weight loss differences. Most panels showed statistically significant, placebo subtracted weight reduction that ranged from 0.6 to 1.4 kg/week, with a mean of approximately 0.9 kg/week over the two to four weeks of treatment in Phase 1.

 Phase 1 Energy Expenditure Clinical Trial
 In collaboration with the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, we investigated setmelanotide in a Phase 1 clinical trial to determine the effects of setmelanotide on energy expenditure, a mechanism for weight loss, in addition to the well‑known effects of MC4R agonists on appetite and food intake. Twelve obese adults were randomized to receive setmelanotide or placebo by continuous SC infusion over 72 hours, followed immediately by crossover to the other treatment. Setmelanotide showed statistically significant 6.85% increases in resting energy expenditure, supporting a role for setmelanotide in weight regulation. This trial provided the first clinical demonstration that MC4R activation with setmelanotide increases resting energy expenditure in obese humans. Long‑Acting Setmelanotide Pharmacokinetic Trial
 In addition to developing the once daily SC injectable formulation of setmelanotide that we are using in our ongoing clinical trials, in collaboration with Camurus AB, or Camurus, we have developed a once weekly, long‑acting formulation using FluidCrystal® technology. When injected subcutaneously, aqueous body fluid is absorbed by the excipient lipid phase which forms a gel‑like depot consisting of liquid crystals formed in situ leading to slow diffusion of setmelanotide from the depot.
 We have compelling preclinical data with the long‑acting formulation: in monkeys, the terminal half‑life of the long‑acting formulation is approximately 105 hours, and in rats, approximately 92 hours. Two‑week toxicology studies in rats have been completed, and the long‑acting formulation was well tolerated. During the two‑week dosing period, animals given setmelanotide had dose‑related, statistically significant lower body weights, from −9.8% to −11.7%, compared to those given placebo controls. Food consumption for animals given setmelanotide was also lower compared to controls, which decreased by approximately −20.5%.
 Two parts of this clinical pharmacokinetic trial are completed, defining the single‑dose and multiple‑dose pharmacokinetics of this formulation. The first part, Part A, is an ascending‑dose, placebo‑controlled, up to three sequential panel PK trial, and PK and safety/tolerability will be collected for approximately 14 days. Dose for the three panels will range from 2.5 mg up to 30 mg given as a single SC injection. The second part, Part B, is a placebo‑controlled, single panel of 12 normal healthy obese patients who received four once‑weekly injections of 10 mg setmelanotide long‑acting formulation.
 The results from Part A demonstrate that a 10 mg single subcutaneous dose showed a profile that was consistent with once weekly dosing with a mean pharmacokinetic half‑life of 123 hours. Following the completion of the single‑dose part, we completed Part B, with multiple dosing in order to evaluate the extended‑release, once‑weekly formulation of setmelanotide. Multiple dosing of the formulation demonstrated tolerability and pharmacokinetics that support further clinical development. While this data is preliminary, and this formulation is anticipated to be only ready for submission in 2021, or later, this simpler dosing regimen may provide improvements in patient convenience, and may provide additional advantages in the pediatric population.

 Safety and Tolerability
 Historically, clinical data with other MC4R therapies suggested that MC4R‑mediated side effects may include changes in blood pressure and heart rate, increased erections in males, changes in libido and sexual function in females and nausea and vomiting. As a result, primarily due to concerns about blood pressure and heart rate changes, none of these therapies have proceeded to commercialization and no other MC4R agonists are currently in the clinic for the treatment of obesity and/or hyperphagia. It is noteworthy that the pattern of effects differed among each of the other MC4R therapies, underscoring the complex physiology of MC4R. With setmelanotide, there has been little, if any, evidence of blood pressure or heart rate changes, preliminarily supporting an important differentiation of setmelanotide from previous MC4R therapies. Careful monitoring for blood pressure and heart rate changes, as well as other potential adverse events, is included in all setmelanotide clinical trials.
 Because of these first generation MC4 therapy failures, the setmelanotide program employed an intensive preclinical screening program to assess clinical candidates for blood pressure and heart rate effects, along with efficacy. The cornerstone of this preclinical screening program was a significant investment in obese primate studies which validated setmelanotide as a promising compound for clinical development.  More recently, new research supporting a unique mechanism of action of setmelanotide, compared to earlier MC4R agonists and the endogenous ligand MSH, was published in May 2018 in Nature Medicine.  

 
  43

 

 Setmelanotide was generally well tolerated in our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, and in very preliminary data from our ongoing Phase 3 trials. Overall, except as outlined below, the number and patterns of adverse events was generally low, and the intensity of the adverse events was generally mild, and infrequently led to clinical trial discontinuation.
 There has been only a single serious adverse event possibly attributed to setmelanotide in our clinical trials. In our Phase 2 clinical trial with once daily SC injection, one patient was hospitalized for unusual chest pain, but no evidence of any serious respiratory or cardiac cause was found after careful evaluation, and the event was attributed to musculoskeletal pain. There were no treatment‑related changes in physical examination, except as noted below, and few, if any, clinically relevant changes in electrocardiograms, laboratory data and/or anti‑drug antibodies. Overall, there have been ten other serious adverse events in the full development program, in addition to the serious adverse event described above: seven others on setmelanotide, mostly from open label trials, including left arm numbness, influenza immunization reaction, pancreatitis secondary to pre‑existing gallstones, pneumonia, hypoglycemia due to acute adrenal insufficiency, due to non‑compliance with hydrocortisone regimen, a depressive episode with elective admission to a psychiatry ward in a patient with history of depression and who continued on treatment, and rotavirus‑related gastroenteritis. There were also three serious adverse events during treatment with placebo, consisting of biliary dyskinesia, severe groin strain, and pelvic inflammatory disease. None of these serious adverse events was considered related to setmelanotide treatment.
 To demonstrate that setmelanotide has the potential to provide a safe cardiovascular profile, we extensively validated setmelanotide in obese primate preclinical studies, with special attention to cardiovascular effects. The results of these studies supported testing in clinical trials. In the clinical trials, we monitored blood pressure and heart rate extensively, primarily by 24‑hour ABPM. In most clinical trials, there were multiple 24‑hour ABPM periods, both on a pre‑treatment and post‑treatment basis. Trial‑by‑trial review of the 24‑hour ABPM data shows little, if any, evidence of changes in heart rate and/or blood pressure even at the highest doses tested in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. We have also conducted an analysis of 24‑hour ABPMs that were obtained pre‑dose and post‑dose across completed studies, which was presented at the Obesity Society in 2015. This included 128 patients, of which 79 were active and 49 were on a placebo. Overall, there was little, if any, evidence of blood pressure or heart rate changes evident from baseline versus placebo in any trial, preliminarily supporting an important differentiation of setmelanotide from previous MC4 therapies. While the preliminary data are encouraging, there will be continued focus on potential cardiovascular risk until addressed in larger and longer clinical trials.

 Setmelanotide Phase 2 SC Injection Trial: 24‑hr ABPM (All Studied Patients),
 Showing No Adverse Effect of Setmelanotide on Blood Pressure or Heart Rate

 In the majority of our trials, there was a small increase in penile erections in male patients, as well as signs of sexual arousal in a small number of female patients. These symptoms were infrequent, generally mild, not painful, and short‑lived. Most often these symptoms were reported in the first week of treatment. There was a small incidence of nausea and vomiting, as well as injection site reactions, both of which usually were reported as mild, early in treatment, and short‑lived. A small number of patients had dose reductions and/or discontinued treatment due to nausea and vomiting.
 We also noted darkening of skin and skin lesions, such as moles and freckles, in most patients who received setmelanotide. This was likely caused by activation of the closely related MC1 receptor, the receptor that mediates skin darkening in response to sun exposure. This was observed generally after one to two weeks of treatment, most often plateaued by two to four weeks of treatment, and like sun‑related tanning, generally returned to baseline after cessation of exposure.
 Additional adverse events noted at somewhat greater rates numerically for setmelanotide compared to placebo across the clinical program include fatigue and related symptoms, diarrhea, arthralgia, back pain and headache, but most investigators reported these effects to be unrelated to setmelanotide.
 While general obese patients are not currently the focus of setmelanotide studies, the FDA and EMA consider the risk and benefit information observed to date with setmelanotide in general obese patients to be supportive of the continued development of this therapy. These data from general obese patients do not raise any new safety concerns and suggest that substantial benefit, as evidenced by weight loss, is possible.
 Preclinical Development
 Preclinical studies demonstrated the efficacy of setmelanotide in suppressing food intake and body weight gain in diet‑induced obese mice, rats, dogs, and rhesus macaques, as well as in genetic models of obesity, including leptin‑deficient ob/ob mice and obese Zucker, or fa/fa (leptin‑receptor deficient), rats. Furthermore, setmelanotide is associated with restoring insulin sensitivity in nonclinical models of obesity in rodents and lowering of plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids.

 In particular, we demonstrated activity in obese non‑human primates, where approximately 13% weight loss was demonstrated with eight weeks of treatment, without evidence of cardiovascular toxicity. We also studied obese primates in crossover studies to confirm the lack of cardiovascular toxicity by setmelanotide in obese primates. These preclinical studies also confirmed the cardiovascular effects of previous MC4 therapies that had produced cardiovascular toxicity in humans. In contrast, setmelanotide was without cardiovascular effects in head‑to‑head studies.
 Lastly, the toxicology program to support the NDA filing of setmelanotide for POMC deficiency obesity is completed. We completed three‑month toxicology studies in rats and monkeys, with doses and exposures that are more than 300‑fold greater than those at the anticipated clinical doses without evidence of clinically relevant toxicological findings. Similarly, we have also completed chronic toxicity studies (6‑month rat, 9‑month monkey), which in rats provided 219‑ (maximum concentration) and 106‑times (area under the curve), respectively, and in monkeys 282‑ and 82‑times, respectively, the exposures at the anticipated clinical doses compared to the No‑Observed‑Adverse‑Effect‑Level(s) in animals. We have evaluated the potential reproductive and development effects of setmelanotide in rats and rabbits with administration by SC injection, to support the administration of setmelanotide in women of child‑bearing potential. In addition, a juvenile toxicology study has been completed that will support dosing in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age. In addition, we are planning carcinogenicity studies, the longest of which is expected to be two years. The FDA has allowed us to defer carcinogenicity studies until after approval of an NDA for setmelanotide. We believe this also to be true for the EMA, however, the EMA has not yet provided firm guidance on the need for submission of results of one or more carcinogenicity studies at the time of filing of an application for marketing authorization in the EU.
 RM‑853, a Preclinical Ghrelin O‑Acyltransferase Inhibitor
 In addition to our development of setmelanotide, in April 2018, we announced that we had acquired exclusive, worldwide rights from Takeda to develop and commercialize RM‑853. RM‑853 is a potent, orally available GOAT inhibitor currently in preclinical development for PWS. PWS is a rare genetic disorder that results in hyperphagia and early‑onset, life‑threatening obesity, for which there are no approved therapeutic options. RM‑853 is currently in pre‑clinical development. We anticipate filing an IND for RM‑853 with the FDA in 2020.
 Ghrelin is an orexigenic peptide, secreted by the stomach and proximal small intestine in response to a negative energy balance. Ghrelin can play a key physiological role in stimulating appetite and promoting food intake, thereby maintaining overall energy balance. In people living with PWS, levels of active ghrelin are elevated, contributing to hyperphagia, which leads to severe obesity. RM‑853 is designed to block GOAT, the key enzyme involved in the production of the active form of ghrelin, with the expected effect of lowering active ghrelin levels. This blockage also increases the levels of des‑acyl‑ghrelin, or DAG, a ghrelin precursor; high levels of DAG are believed to have independent beneficial effects on the control of appetite and tissue homeostasis, which might add to the potential efficacy of RM‑853 in PWS. In preclinical research, RM‑853 prevented body weight gain and reduced fat mass in high fat‑fed mice, with a favorable pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profile. We plan to complete preclinical studies of RM‑853 and file an IND with the FDA in approximately the first quarter of 2020. Under the terms of the agreement, we will assume sole responsibility for the global product development and commercialization of RM‑853.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We have competitors in a number of jurisdictions, many of which have substantially greater name recognition, commercial infrastructures and financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. Established competitors may invest heavily to quickly discover and develop compounds that could make setmelanotide obsolete or uneconomical. Any new product that competes with an approved product may need to demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety to be commercially successful. Other competitive factors, including generic competition, could force us to lower prices or could result in reduced sales. In addition, new products developed by others could emerge as competitors to setmelanotide. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.

 There are no current pharmacological treatments for regulating hunger and hyperphagia‑related behaviors of patients with PWS. In contrast with the absence of companies who have disclosed efforts to study upstream disorders of the MC4 pathway, we are aware of several companies investigating or developing therapies intended to treat hunger and hyperphagia associated with PWS. The different companies and compounds in development, of which we are aware, involve multiple mechanisms of action. The companies and their compounds include; Millendo Therapeutics Inc. (AZP‑531), Soleno Therapeutics (Diazoxide Choline Controlled Release), Zafgen (ZGN‑1258), GLWL Research Inc. (GLWL‑01), Insys Therapeutics Inc. (Oral Cannabidiol Solution) and Calm Therapeutics.
 Licensing Agreements
 Ipsen Pharma S.A.S.
 In February 2010, the Predecessor Company entered into a license agreement with Ipsen S.A.S., or Ipsen, pursuant to which Ipsen granted to it an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain patents and other intellectual property rights to research, develop, and commercialize compounds that were discovered or researched by Ipsen in the course of conducting its MC4 program or that otherwise were covered by the licensed patents. Rights under the license included the right to research, develop and commercialize setmelanotide. Pursuant to the license, Ipsen also granted to the Predecessor Company a non‑exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain patents and other intellectual property rights that were licensed by Ipsen from a third party or that Ipsen may develop in the future to research, develop, and commercialize any of the compounds exclusively licensed by Ipsen pursuant to the license.  See “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Corporate Background and Distribution.”
 On March 21, 2013, the LLC entity completed the Corporate Reorganization pursuant to which, among other things, the existing license with Ipsen with respect to the MC4 program is now held separately by us. As a result we hold the rights to the MC4 program, including the rights to develop and commercialize setmelanotide.  See “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Corporate Background and Distribution.”
 Under the terms of the Ipsen license agreement, Ipsen will receive payments of up to $40.0 million upon the achievement of certain development and commercial milestones in connection with the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of applicable licensed products, and royalties on future sales of the licensed products. Substantially all of the aggregate payments under the Ipsen license agreement are for milestones that may be achieved no earlier than first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product. Royalties in the mid‑single digits on future sales of the applicable licensed products will be due under the Ipsen license agreement on a licensed product‑by‑licensed product and country‑by‑country basis until the later of the date when sales of a licensed product in a particular country are no longer covered by patent rights licensed pursuant to the Ipsen license agreement and the tenth anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country. The term of the Ipsen license agreement continues until the expiration of the applicable royalty term on a country‑by‑country and product‑by‑ product basis. Upon expiration of the term of the agreement, the licensed rights granted to us under the agreement, to the extent they remain in effect at the time of expiration, will thereafter become irrevocable, perpetual and fully paid‑up licenses that survive the expiration of the term. We have a right to terminate the license agreement at any time during the term for any reason on 180 days’ written notice to Ipsen. Ipsen has a right to terminate the agreement prior to expiration of its term for our material breach of the agreement, our failure to initiate or complete development of a licensed product or our bringing an action seeking to have an Ipsen license patent right declared invalid. Upon any early termination of the license agreement not due to Ipsen’s material breach, all licensed rights granted under the license agreement will terminate.
 Camurus
 In January 2016, we entered into a license agreement for the use of Camurus’ drug delivery technology, FluidCrystal, to formulate setmelanotide with Camurus. Under the terms of the agreement, Camurus granted us a worldwide license to the FluidCrystal technology to formulate setmelanotide and to develop, manufacture, and commercialize this new formulation for once‑weekly dosing, administered as a SC injection. The license granted to us is specific to the FluidCrystal technology incorporating setmelanotide. Under the terms of the license agreement, we are responsible for manufacturing, development, and commercialization of the setmelanotide FluidCrystal formulation 

 
  47

 
worldwide. Camurus received a non‑refundable and non‑creditable upfront payment of $0.5 million in January 2016, and is eligible to receive progressive payments of approximately $65.0 million, of which the majority are sales milestones. In addition, Camurus is eligible to receive tiered, mid to mid‑high, single digit royalties on future sales of the product.
 The term of the agreement continues until the expiration of the applicable royalty term on a country‑by‑country and product‑by‑product basis. Upon expiration of the term of the agreement, the licensed rights granted to us under the agreement, to the extent they remain in effect at the time of expiration, will thereafter become irrevocable, perpetual and fully paid‑up licenses that survive the expiration of the term. We have a right to terminate the license agreement at any time during the term for any reason upon 90 days’ written notice to Camurus. Camurus has a right to terminate the agreement prior to expiration of its term for our material breach of the agreement, if we voluntarily or involuntarily file for bankruptcy, or for our bringing an action seeking to have a Camurus license patent right declared invalid. Upon any early termination of the license agreement not due to Camurus’ material breach, all licensed rights granted under the license agreement will terminate.
 Takeda
 In March 2018, we acquired exclusive, worldwide rights from Takeda to develop and commercialize RM‑853. RM‑853 is a potent, orally available GOAT inhibitor currently in preclinical development for PWS. PWS is a rare genetic disorder that results in hyperphagia and early‑onset, life‑threatening obesity, for which there are no approved therapeutic options. We will assume sole responsibility for the global product development and commercialization of RM‑853. Takeda received an upfront fee of $4.4 million which we settled in April 2018 with shares of our common stock, and is eligible to receive milestone payments of approximately $140.0 million, most of which are payable upon regulatory approval or are sales milestones. In addition, Takeda is eligible to receive back‑end development milestones, and single‑digit royalties on future RM‑853 sales.
 Among other obligations under our agreement with Takeda, Takeda has a right of first negotiation under certain circumstances to sublicense the assets we acquired from Takeda in the territory of Japan. This right of first negotiation remains in effect until the earlier of five years from the date of the agreement, consummation of a change in control, or sublicense to a third party. This may delay or limit our ability to enter into certain transactions with respect to this product candidate.
 The term of the agreement continues until the expiration of the applicable royalty term on a country‑by‑country and product‑by‑product basis. Upon expiration of the term of the agreement, the licensed rights granted to us under the agreement, to the extent they remain in effect at the time of expiration, will thereafter become irrevocable, perpetual and fully paid‑up licenses that survive the expiration of the term. We have a right to terminate the license agreement at any time during the term for any reason upon 90 days’ written notice to Takeda. Takeda has a right to terminate the agreement prior to expiration of its term for our material breach of the agreement, if we voluntarily or involuntarily file for bankruptcy, or for our bringing an action seeking to have a Takeda license patent right declared invalid. Upon any early termination of the license agreement not due to Takeda’s material breach, all licensed rights granted under the license agreement will terminate.
 Commercial Operations
 Our commercial strategies center around creating a well‑informed, supportive genetic obesity community of institutions, healthcare providers, patients, caregivers, and payers to support our ongoing research and development efforts to transform the care of patients with MC4 pathway deficiencies.
 Our commercial priorities for the launch of setmelanotide include:

· | Improving methods of evaluation and diagnosis of rare genetic obesity patients through enhanced diagnostic capabilities and partnership with key opinion leaders and pediatric endocrinologists in order to more clearly articulate the clinical presentation of these patients to referring physicians;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  48

 


· | Facilitating an integrated genetic obesity community through services that support patient awareness, education, advocacy, and treatment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Communicating the burden of rare genetic obesity syndromes to promote advocacy for patient sequencing and support for pricing and reimbursement of setmelanotide; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Building a global commercial organization to drive patient identification and enable a successful launch of setmelanotide.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our management team understands the complexity of rare diseases and we believe has the necessary expertise to be a true partner to patients, caregivers, advocacy, and healthcare teams leading to shared success. We intend to establish a specialty sales force and develop an organizational infrastructure that will support an extensive network of endocrinologists and other physicians treating severe childhood obesity and rare genetic disorders of obesity which in turn we believe will help establish genetic obesity centers of excellence. Our goal is for our field personnel to work directly with patients, caregivers and healthcare providers to facilitate therapy initiation and adherence. We also expect to partner with existing and new advocacy organizations to further educate our patient population on genetic obesity and support coverage for setmelanotide. In addition, we intend to establish our own commercial sales and marketing organization in the United States and core strategic markets and to selectively establish partnerships in markets outside the United States for sales, marketing and distribution.
 Patents and Proprietary Rights
 We have in‑licensed a large patent portfolio from Ipsen for our melanocortin programs. The portfolio includes multiple patent families, and all of these in‑licensed patent families are being prosecuted or maintained by Ipsen in consultation with us. We have also filed patent applications in five families which are exclusively owned and maintained by us that relate to the melanocortin program.
 Our MC4 portfolio of licensed and exclusively owned patent families, which includes setmelanotide, consists of 12 patent families currently being prosecuted or maintained, which include applications and patents directed to compositions of matter, formulations and methods of treatment using setmelanotide. As of June 8, 2018, the portfolio for the MC‑4 program consists of 14 issued United States patents and 54 issued non‑United States patents across eight of the 12 families. We are actively pursuing eight United States patent applications and 43 non‑United States applications in 12 jurisdictions.
 In the patent family directed to selected MC4 receptor agonists, including the composition of matter for setmelanotide, we have three issued United States patents and 26 issued non‑United States patents, including Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Russia and Singapore. The standard 20‑year term for patents in this family would expire in 2026, but two of the United States patents are expected to expire in 2027 due to patent term adjustments. Patent term extensions for delays in marketing approval may also extend the terms of patents in this family.
 In addition to the patents and patent applications discussed above, we co‑own one patent family with Charité‑Universitätsmedizin Berlin, which has been filed in 21 jurisdictions. We have also filed one application in the United States co‑owned with the University of Strasbourg and the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research. These applications relate to the melanocortin program and, have not yet entered active prosecution.
 We have also in‑licensed a patent family from Takeda directed to the composition of matter and methods of use of ghrelin O‑acetyltransferase inhibitors, including RM‑853. This patent family includes one issued United States patent, nine issued non‑United States patents including China, Europe, and Japan, and one pending application in Canada. The standard 20‑year term for the patents in this family will expire in 2033, though patent term extensions for delays in marketing approval may also extend the terms of patents in this family.

 Intellectual Property Protection Strategy
 We currently seek, and intend to continue seeking, patent protection whenever commercially reasonable for any patentable aspects of setmelanotide and related technology or any new products or product candidates we acquire in the future. Where our intellectual property is not protected by patents, we may seek to protect it through other means, including maintenance of trade secrets and careful protection of our proprietary information. Our license from Ipsen for the melanocortin program require Ipsen, subject to certain exceptions and upon consultation with us, to prosecute and maintain its patent rights as they relate to the licensed compounds and methods. If Ipsen decides to cease prosecution or maintenance of any of the licensed patent rights, we have the option to take over prosecution and maintenance of those patents and Ipsen will assign to us all of its rights in such patents. For those patent rights that we own exclusively, we control all prosecution and maintenance activities.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether the product candidate we in‑license will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction, and furthermore, we cannot determine whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection to protect us from competitors, or will be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. This potential issue is exacerbated by the fact that, prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States, the first to make the claimed invention may be entitled to the patent. On March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a “first to file” system in which the first inventor to file a patent application may be entitled to the patent. Therefore, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention. Moreover, we may have to participate in other proceedings declared by the United States PTO or a foreign patent office, such as post‑grant proceedings and oppositions, that challenge the validity of a granted patent. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
 Although we currently have issued patents directed to a number of different attributes of our products, and pending applications on others, there can be no assurance that any issued patents would be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using specific compounds or technology. To the extent prudent, we intend to bring litigation against third parties that we believe are infringing our patents.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non‑provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States PTO in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent with an earlier expiration date.
 As mentioned above, in the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA‑approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We intend to seek patent term adjustments and extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such adjustments or extensions.
 To protect our rights to any of our issued patents and proprietary information, we may need to litigate against infringing third parties, or avail ourselves of the courts or participate in hearings to determine the scope and validity of those patents or other proprietary rights. These types of proceedings are often costly and could be very time‑consuming to us, and we cannot be certain that the deciding authorities will rule in our favor. An unfavorable decision could result in 

 
  50

 
the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our patents or forfeiture of the rights associated with our patents or pending patent applications. Any such decision could result in our key technologies not being protectable, allowing third parties to use our technology without being required to pay us licensing fees or may compel us to license needed technologies from third parties to avoid infringing third‑party patent and proprietary rights. Such a decision could even result in the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our patents or could cause us to lose our rights under existing issued patents or not to have rights granted under our pending patent applications.
 In addition, we intend to seek orphan drug exclusivity in jurisdictions in which it is available. A prerequisite to orphan drug exclusivity in the United States and in the European Union is orphan drug designation. An orphan drug designation may be granted, subject to fulfillment of specific criteria, where a drug is developed specifically to treat a rare or uncommon medical treatment. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in certain very limited circumstances, for a period of seven years in the United States and 10 years in the European Union. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for an indication.
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual will be our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
 Manufacturing
 We currently contract with a third party for the manufacture of setmelanotide and intend to continue to do so in the future. We have entered into a process development and manufacturing services agreement with CordenPharma International, formerly Peptisyntha SA prior to its acquisition by CordenPharma International, or Peptisyntha, under which Peptisyntha will provide certain process development and manufacturing services in connection with the manufacture of setmelanotide. Under the agreement, we pay Peptisyntha for services in accordance with the terms of mutually agreed upon work orders, which we and Peptisyntha may enter into from time to time. The agreement also provides that, subject to certain conditions, for a period following each product launch date, we will source from Peptisyntha a portion of our requirements for that product being sourced from non‑affiliate third parties. Under the agreement, each party is subject to customary indemnification provisions.
 The Peptisyntha agreement will continue, unless earlier terminated pursuant to its terms, until the later of six years from the July 17, 2013 effective date or the completion of all services under all work plans executed in accordance with the terms of the agreement prior to the sixth anniversary of its effective date. The agreement may be extended by us continuously for additional two‑year periods upon written notice to Peptisyntha. We also may terminate the agreement or any work order thereunder upon at least 30 days’ prior written notice to Peptisyntha.
 We have also entered into a process development and manufacturing services agreement with Recipharm Monts S.A.S., or Recipharm, under which Recipharm will provide certain process development and manufacturing services in connection with the manufacture of setmelanotide. Under the agreement, we pay Recipharm for services in accordance with the terms of mutually agreed upon work orders, which we and Recipharm may enter into from time to time. Under the agreement, each party is subject to customary indemnification provisions. The Recipharm agreement will continue, unless earlier terminated pursuant to its terms, until the later of three years from the December 21, 2016 effective date or 

 
  51

 
the completion of all services under all work plans executed in accordance with the terms of the agreement prior to the third anniversary of its effective date. The agreement may be extended by us continuously for additional two‑year periods upon written notice to Recipharm. We also may terminate the agreement or any work order thereunder upon at least 60 days’ prior written notice to Recipharm.
 Our contract manufacturing agreements give us visibility into the expected future cost of producing setmelanotide at commercial scale. Based upon a range of prices of currently‑marketed therapies indicated for orphan diseases, we believe that our cost of goods for setmelanotide will be highly competitive.
 We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. To meet our projected needs for clinical supplies to support our activities through regulatory approval and commercial manufacturing, the contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, with whom we currently work will need to increase scale of production or we expect that we will need to secure alternate suppliers. We have not currently identified alternate suppliers in the event the current CMOs we utilize are unable to scale production. Because we rely on these CMOs, we have personnel with pharmaceutical development and manufacturing experience who are responsible for maintaining our CMO relationships.
 Regulatory Matters
 Government Regulation and Product Approvals
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, including pharmacovigilance, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other competent authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States
 In the United States, the FDA approves drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and associated implementing regulations. Biological products, on the other hand, are licensed by the FDA under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA. With passage of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, Congress amended the definition of “biological product” in the PHSA so as to exclude a chemically synthesized polypeptide from licensure under the PHSA. Rather, the Act provided that such products would be treated as drugs under the FDCA. Subsequently, through final guidance issued in April 2015, the FDA indicated that a “chemically synthesized polypeptide” is any alpha amino acid polymer that is made entirely by chemical synthesis and is less than 100 amino acids in size. Accordingly, based on this FDA guidance, we believe that our products will not be treated as biologics subject to approval of a biologics license application, or BLA, by the FDA, and rather will be treated as drug products subject to approval of a new drug application, or NDA, by the FDA pursuant to the FDCA.
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  52

 


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable, as may be requested by the FDA to assist with its review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | payment of user fees, per published Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines for the relevant year, and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | compliance with any post‑approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post‑approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The failure to comply with applicable requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
 Preclinical Studies
 Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long‑term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 The IND and IRB Processes
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30‑day 

 
  53

 
waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30‑day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. The FDA’s regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an IND or an NDA require that such studies be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non‑IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non‑IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Human Clinical Studies in Support of an NDA
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.

 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

· | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well‑controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk‑benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 4: Post‑approval studies, when applicable, are conducted following initial approval, typically to gain additional experience and data from treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 During the course of clinical development the sponsor often refines the indication and endpoints on which the NDA will be based. For endpoints based on PROs and OROs, the process is typically iterative. The FDA has issued guidance on the framework it uses to evaluate PRO instruments, and it may offer advice on optimizing PRO and ORO instruments during the clinical development process, but the FDA usually reserves final judgment until it reviews the NDA.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 In a general guidance meeting with FDA review staff in 2013, following the opening of our independent new drug application for the development of setmelanotide, the FDA provided us with general principles to follow in designing clinical studies for drugs intended for use in an indication targeted to a specific obese population. In 2015, we received further guidance from FDA review staff in a meeting to discuss clinical endpoints and trial design strategies for the study of setmelanotide in patients with rare genetic forms of obesity. At that meeting, the FDA noted its experience in applying regulatory flexibility for drugs intended to treat rare diseases. It indicated that it would take into account factors related to particular patient populations, such as the prevalence and severity of the disease, but also noted that the requirements for a phase 3 program would depend on the effect observed and the robustness of the results. The FDA also indicated that it 

 
  55

 
would exercise flexibility regarding the timing and requirements for certain preclinical toxicology testing. Additional meetings occurred in 2017 and 2018.  We intend to continue to take advantage of our Breakthrough Therapy designation by continuing to meet regularly with FDA review staff to discuss methods to shorten the development timeline for indication in POMC deficiency obesity, LEPR deficiency obesity, Bardet‑Biedl syndrome, and Alström syndrome, and to use the knowledge gained to do likewise for other closely‑related indications in rare genetic forms of obesity.
 Submission and Review of an NDA by the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017 (PDUFA VI), the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a human drug application fee, which is collected at the time of submission. PDUFA VI eliminated user fees for supplements and establishments. In addition, the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fee rather than product fees under the previous iteration of PDUFA. 
 Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for drugs with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses. Orphan designated drugs are also exempt from program fees if the drug meets certain public health and revenue criteria.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which the FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of drugs that are not NMEs, the ten‑month and six‑month review periods run from the date the FDA receives the application. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre‑approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing, e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredients, finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP.
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post‑approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.

 
  56

 

 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions: Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for beneficial treatment if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition. These expedited programs are referred to as Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review designation, and accelerated approval.  The 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, signed into law in December 2016, authorized $500 million in new funding over nine years to help the FDA accelerate review and approval of products and bring new innovations and advances to patients faster and more efficiently. The Cures Act enhances the FDA’s ability to modernize clinical trial designs and clinical outcome assessments to speed the development and review of novel medical products. Fast Track
 The FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. Breakthrough Therapy
 A product may be designated as Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross‑disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. Priority Review
 The FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case‑by‑case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment‑limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.

 Accelerated Approval Pathway
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life‑threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug.
 Accelerated approval is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. Thus, the benefit of accelerated approval derives from the potential to receive approval based on surrogate endpoints sooner than possible for trials with clinical or survival endpoints, rather than deriving from any explicit shortening of the FDA approval timeline, as is the case with priority review.
 Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post‑approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post‑marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post‑approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post‑approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post‑marketing studies, would allow the FDA to initiate expedited proceedings to withdraw approval of the drug. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post‑approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability 

 
  58

 
of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post‑market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Post‑Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third‑party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post‑market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning letters or holds on post‑approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

  The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct‑to‑consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In the United States, healthcare professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off‑label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in non‑promotional, non‑misleading communication regarding off‑label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. If a company is found to have promoted off‑label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in 

 
  59

 
which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementation regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCSA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch‑Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme allowing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference‑listed drug, or RLD.
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.”
 Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
 Under the Hatch‑Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non‑patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non‑patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
 The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three‑year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three‑year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five‑year NCE exclusivity, an award of three‑year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the 

 
  60

 
date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about granting data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.
 505(b)(2) NDAs
 As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA pursuant to an NDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch‑Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically and legally appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the previously approved reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Hatch‑Waxman Patent Certification and the 30‑Month Stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

· | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


· | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval.  A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification.
 If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders within 60 days of the date the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired.

 Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (FDASIA) , sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and any other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 In addition, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA) requires the FDA to meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with drug sponsors. The legislation requires the FDA to meet with drug sponsors by no later than the end‑of‑phase 1 meeting for serious or life‑threatening diseases and by no later than 90 days after the FDA’s receipt of the study plan.
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless and until the FDA promulgates a regulation stating otherwise, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non‑patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non‑patent and orphan exclusivity. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. With regard to patents, the six‑month pediatric exclusivity period will not attach to any patents for which a generic (ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA) applicant submitted a paragraph IV patent certification, unless the NDA sponsor or patent owner first obtains a court determination that the patent is valid and infringed by a proposed generic product.
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for that drug for that rare disease or condition. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages, such as tax benefits and exemptions from the PDUFA application and program fees.
 If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug for different indications. If a drug or drug product designated as 

 
  62

 
an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated on its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
 Under FDARA, orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another orphan drug under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. The new legislation reverses prior precedent holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority.
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension, also known as patent term restriction, under the Hatch‑Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. Patent term extension is generally available only for drug products whose active ingredient has not previously been approved by the FDA. The restoration period granted is typically one‑half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term extension cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States PTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA.
 FDA Approval and Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 If safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic medical device, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as an in vitro companion diagnostic device, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostic devices. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, an in vitro companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling.
 If the FDA determines that an in vitro companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, the FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the in vitro companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the in vitro companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population.  The FDA recently reiterated its position that a Laboratory Developed Test, or LDT, is sufficient for identifying patients in our clinical trials, but the agency also recently indicated that approval of an in vitro companion diagnostic device, or companion diagnostic, may eventually be necessary. The FDA stated that absence of complete development of a companion diagnostic would not preclude us from submitting an NDA or preclude the FDA from reviewing it. The FDA also stated that completing development of a companion diagnostic as a post-marketing commitment or a post-marketing requirement is a possibility, assuming that upon review, no issues related to efficacy or safety arise that would necessitate a companion diagnostic at the time of approval. In the event that a companion diagnostic is needed at any time, the FDA committed to working with us to identify the least burdensome analytical validation approach to a companion diagnostic for setmelanotide. The FDA also agreed to further consider the issues raised by us, which included our reasons why a companion diagnostic should not be required, and to provide follow-up advice. 
 Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including in vitro companion diagnostic devices, are generally regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post‑market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests 

 
  63

 
require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. The FDA has generally required in vitro companion diagnostic devices intended to select the patients who will respond to a drug to obtain a PMA for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the drug.
 The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $250,000 for most PMAs. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, a PMA application typically requires data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
 PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time‑consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post‑approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
 Regulation and Procedures Governing Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of setmelanotide to the extent we choose to sell any setmelanotide outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by equivalent competent authorities in foreign jurisdictions before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post‑approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, pharmacovigilance, promotion, advertising or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States.

 
  64

 

 The process governing the marketing authorization of medicinal products in the European Union entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to establish the safety, quality and efficacy of the medicinal product for each proposed therapeutic indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the European Union.
 Clinical Trial Approval
 The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU member states govern the system for the approval of conduct of clinical trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU member states in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted. The Regulation was anticipated to enter into force in 2019, but it is expected to be delayed. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU member states, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the European Union will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which on‑going clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial.
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The Clinical Trials Regulation introduces a complete overhaul of the existing legislation governing clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU. This includes a new coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials that is reminiscent of the mutual recognition procedure for marketing authorization of medicinal products, and increased obligations on sponsors to publish clinical trial results. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU member states in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (member states concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each member state concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU member state. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 Marketing Authorization
 To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EU member states (decentralized procedure, national procedure or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA‑approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product‑specific waiver, (2) a class waiver or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.  By a decision of 15 June 2018, the EMA formally accepted the PIPs for setmelanotide in the treatment of appetite and general nutritional disorders.  This included the deferral and waiver requested by us.  

 
  65

 

 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU member states and three of the four European Free Trade Association, or EFTA, States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. Medicinal products that contain a new active substance that is not yet authorized in the EEA and medicinal products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients within the EU fall within the optional scope of the centralized marketing authorization procedure.
 Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post‑authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the CHMP is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. At the end of this period, the EMA’s CHMP provides a scientific opinion on whether or not a marketing authorization should be granted in relation to a medicinal product. Within 15 calendar days of receipt of a final opinion from the CHMP, the European Commission must prepare a draft decision concerning an application for marketing authorization. This draft decision must take the opinion and any relevant provisions of EU law into account. Before arriving at a final decision on an application for centralized authorization of a medicinal product the European Commission must consult the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use. The Standing Committee is composed of representatives of the EU member states and chaired by a non‑voting European Commission representative. The European Parliament also has a related “droit de regard”. The European Parliament’s role is to ensure that the European Commission has not exceeded its powers in deciding to grant or refuse to grant a marketing authorization.
 The EMA offers the possibility to medicinal product developers to participate in a voluntary scheme of enhanced interaction and early dialogue with the EMA, to enhance support for the development of medicinal products that target an unmet medical need. This voluntary scheme is called PRIority MEdicine support scheme, or PRIME. PRIME is intended to enable accelerated assessment of applications for marketing authorizations of medicinal products.
 Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a submission of a separate application to, and leads to grant of separate marketing authorizations by, the competent authorities of each EU member state in which the product is to be marketed. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The assessment of the application for marketing authorization is conducted by the reference EU member state.  This reference EU member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU member states who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the Heads of Medicines Agencies, or CMDh for review.  This review, which may also be escalated to the CHMP in case of disagreement in CMDh would result in a decision by the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU member states.

 
  66

 


The mutual recognition procedure permits companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one EU member state to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU member states. The national marketing authorization procedure is founded on the same basic EU regulatory process as the other marketing authorization procedures discussed in this Section. The national marketing authorization procedure, which is increasingly rare, permits a company to submit an application to the competent authority of a single EU member state and, if successful, to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid only in this EU member state.
 Regulatory Data Protection in the European Union

In the European Union, innovative medicinal products authorized on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products authorized in accordance the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents applicants for authorization of generics or biosimilars of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) or biosimilar application for a period of eight years. During an additional two‑year period of market exclusivity, an application for the marketing authorization of a generic or biosimilar medicinal product can be submitted and a related marketing authorization may be granted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar medicinal product can be placed on the European Union market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten‑year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a medicinal product is granted data and market exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals
 A marketing authorization has an initial validity for five years in principle. The marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re‑evaluation of the risk‑benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the EU member states may decide, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five year period of marketing authorization. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the European Union market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing EU member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so‑called sunset clause).
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provides that a medicinal product can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life‑threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (2) a life‑threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicinal product in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
 Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity in all EU member states and in addition a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all EU 

 
  67

 
member states and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the 10 year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity
 Regulatory Requirements after a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained
 In case an authorization for a medicinal product in the European Union is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include:

· | Compliance with the European Union’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post‑authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable European Union laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with European Union cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the European Union with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the European Union.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The advertising and promotion of medicinal products are subject to EU laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual EU member states may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. It forms an intrinsic and integral part of the marketing authorization granted for the medicinal product. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off label promotion. The off label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The applicable laws at EU level and in the individual EU member states also prohibit the direct to consumer advertising of prescription only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with health care professionals.

  Regulatory Procedure Governing CE marking Companion Diagnostics in the European Union
 In the European Union, in vitro medical devices are required to conform with the essential requirements of the European Union Directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Directive 98/79/EC, as amended). To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, the manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. The conformity assessment varies according to the type of in vitro diagnostic medical device. The conformity assessment of in vitro diagnostic medical devices can require the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization designated by the competent authorities of an EU member state to conduct conformity assessments. The Notified Body will issue a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the in vitro diagnostic medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the requirements of the Directive. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical device after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity. For in vitro diagnostic medical devices which do not require the intervention of a 

 
  68

 
notified body, the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self‑assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements laid down in the in vitro diagnostic medical device Directive.
 In April 2017, the EU Regulation on In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices (Regulation (EU) 2017/746), or IVDR, was adopted. The IVDR repeals and replaces Directive 98/79/EC. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the individual EU member states, the IVDR will be directly applicable in the EU member states and on the basis of the EEA agreement in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The IVDR is, among other things, intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for in vitro diagnostic medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The IVDR will  apply beginning on 26 May 2022. Once applicable, the IVDR will introduce new classification rules for in vitro diagnostic medical devices and new regulatory requirements. The IVDR will also impose increased compliance obligations for manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic medical devices to access the EEA market.  Moreover, the scrutiny imposed by notified bodies for the technical documentation related these devices will increase considerably.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the United Kingdom provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the EU Treaty. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom. covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the marketing authorization of product candidates in the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage and Reimbursement
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third‑party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use setmelanotide unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Even if setmelanotide is approved, sales will depend, in part, on the extent to which third‑party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third‑party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, setmelanotide may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third‑party payor not to cover setmelanotide could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third‑party reimbursement and coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

 
  69

 

 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost‑containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost‑containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third‑party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for setmelanotide will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of setmelanotide or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost‑effectiveness of a particular medicinal product candidate to currently available therapies or so called Health Technology Assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other EU member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions.  The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, and particularly in relation to prescription only medicinal products, has become more intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.
 Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is, however, becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU member states, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Sweden. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost‑effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU member states. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product varies between EU member states. In addition, pursuant to Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of patients’ rights in cross‑border healthcare, a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU member states was established. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This may lead to harmonization of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTAs between EU member states and in pricing and reimbursement decisions and may negatively affect price in at least some EU member states.
 As a further step in this direction, on January 31, 2018, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on HTA. This legislative proposal is intended to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The proposal would permit EU member states to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and

reimbursement. The European Commission has stated that the role of the draft HTA regulation is not to influence pricing and reimbursement decisions in the individual EU member states. However, this consequence cannot be excluded.
 Healthcare Law and Regulation
 Healthcare providers and third‑party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements and interactions with healthcare professionals, third‑party payors, and patients, among others, are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti‑kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements, particularly once third‑party reimbursement, including under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally‑funded health care programs, becomes available for one or more of our products. The federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to the following:
· | the United States federal healthcare Anti‑Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, or receiving remuneration (anything of value), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Liability under the Anti‑Kickback Statute may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as consultants, advisors and speakers, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti‑kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants, charitable donations, product support and patient assistance programs;

· | the federal civil False Claims Act prohibits individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Such private individuals may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in recovery or settlement. Many pharmaceutical manufacturers have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper activities including causing false claims to be submitted as a result of the marketing of their products for unapproved and thus non‑reimbursable uses, inflating prices reported to private price publication services which are used to set drug payment rates under government healthcare programs, and other interactions with prescribers and other customers including those that may have affected their billing or coding practices and submission to the federal government. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and significant mandatory penalties per false or fraudulent claim or statement for violations. Because of the potential for large monetary exposure, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages and per claim penalties that may be awarded in litigation proceedings. Settlements may require companies to

enter into corporate integrity agreements with the government, which may impose substantial costs on companies to ensure compliance. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non‑government health benefit programs;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;

· | HIPAA and its implementing regulations, which impose obligations with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. We may obtain health information from third parties (including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA – other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits – we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. Manufacturers must submit reports on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year; and

· | analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services that are reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, by non‑governmental third‑party payors, including private insurers.

  In addition to the foregoing requirements, we expect to participate in and have certain price reporting obligations to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, if we successfully commercialize setmelanotide, we would be required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data we would have to report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the U.S. in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions.  Our failure to comply with these price reporting and rebate payment obligations if we participate in the program could negatively impact our financial results.

 
  72

 

 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.  The ACA is discussed in greater detail under the heading “Healthcare Reform” and under the risk factor “Current and future healthcare reform legislation or regulation may increase the difficulty and cost for us and any future collaborators to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize setmelanotide and may adversely affect the prices we, or they, may obtain and may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the 340B program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low‑income patients. The ACA expanded the list of covered entities to include certain free‑standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, but exempts “orphan drugs” from the ceiling price requirements for these covered entities. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, and in general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement. Any additional future changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the Medicaid rebate amount under the ACA or other legislation or regulation could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations if we successfully commercialize setmelanotide. 
 HRSA issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019.  It is currently unclear how HRSA will apply its enforcement authority under the new regulation.  HRSA also is implementing a reporting requirement related to the 340B program during the first quarter of 2019, which would require us to report the 340B ceiling price for our covered outpatient drugs to HRSA every quarter. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting.
 In order to be eligible to have our products that we successfully commercialize paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we also would have to participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program. As part of this program, we would be obligated to make our products available for procurement on an FSS contract under which we must comply with standard government terms and conditions and charge a price that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price, or FCP, to four federal agencies (VA, U.S. Department of Defense, or DOD, Public Health Service, and U.S. Coast Guard).
 The FCP is based on the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price, or Non-FAMP, which we would be required to calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. Pursuant to applicable law, knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject a manufacturer to significant civil monetary penalties for each item of false information. The FSS pricing and contracting obligations also contain extensive disclosure and certification requirements.For additional information regarding obligations under federal health care programs, refer to the risk factor entitled “If we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under that program or other governmental pricing programs that we participate in, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Additionally, several states now require prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states. Other states prohibit various other marketing‑related activities, including the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients 

 
  73

 
for certain prescription drugs. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes and other states and cities require identification or licensing of sales representatives. In addition, several states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations also govern the privacy and security of health information and the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health‑related and other personal information, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, such as Section 5 of the FTC Act, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws may face civil penalties.
 Compliance with these federal and state laws and regulations will require substantial resources. Various state and federal regulatory and enforcement agencies continue actively to investigate violations of health care laws and regulations, and the United States Congress continues to strengthen the arsenal of enforcement tools. Enforcement agencies also continue to pursue novel theories of liability under these laws. In particular, government agencies recently have increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement activity with respect to manufacturer reimbursement support activities and patient support programs, including bringing criminal charges or civil enforcement actions under the federal health care Anti-Kickback statute, civil False Claims Act and violations of health care fraud and HIPAA privacy provisions. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the criminal and civil penalties that can be imposed for violating certain federal health care laws, including the Anti Kickback Statute.  Most recently, the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services proposed revisions to the Anti-Kickback Statute regulatory safe harbors that if finalized may have significant affect on pharmaceutical manufacturer interactions with pharmacy benefit managers and insurers. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, imprisonment, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government‑funded healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 In the EU, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self‑regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct in the individual EU member states. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti‑bribery laws of the EU member states. One example is the UK Bribery Act 2010. This Act applies to any company incorporated in or “carrying on business” in the UK, irrespective of where in the world the alleged bribery activity occurs. This Act could have implications for our interactions with physicians in and outside the UK. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
 Payments made to physicians in certain EU member states must be publically disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, their competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU member states. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the individual EU member states. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
 Failure to comply with the EU member state laws implementing the Community Code on medicinal products, and EU rules governing the promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, with the EU member state laws that apply to the promotion of medicinal products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti‑corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the EU member state authorities, which may include any of the following: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall.
 EU member states, Switzerland and other countries have also adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the EU, the collection and use of personal health data is governed by the 

 
  74

 
provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018, repealing the Data Protection Directive and increasing our responsibility and liability in relation to the processing of personal data of EU subjects.
 The GDPR, together with the national legislation of the EU member states governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EU, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data, and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. Data protection authorities from the different EU member states may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised.
 With respect to the transfer of personal data out of the EU, the GDPR provides that the transfer of personal data to countries that are not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection, including the United States, is permitted only on the basis of complying with specific legal steps.
 The judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C‑362/14 Maximillian Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner, or the Schrems case, held that the Safe Harbor Framework, which was relied upon by many United States entities as a basis for transfer of personal data from the EU to the United States, was invalid. United States entities may, therefore, rely only on the alternate procedures for such data transfer provided in the EU Data Protection Directive.
 On February 29, 2016, however, the European Commission announced an agreement with the United States Department of Commerce, or the DOC, to replace the invalidated Safe Harbor framework with a new “Privacy Shield.” On July 12, 2016, the European Commission adopted a decision on the adequacy of the protection provided by the Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is intended to address the requirements set out by the Court of Justice of the European Union in the Schrems case. The Privacy Shield imposes more stringent obligations on companies, provides stronger monitoring and enforcement by the DOC and the Federal Trade Commission, and makes commitments on the part of public authorities regarding access to information. United States entities have been able to certify to the DOC their compliance with the privacy principles of the Privacy Shield since August 1, 2016 and rely on the Privacy Shield certification to transfer of personal data from the EU to the United States.
 However, in October 2016, the French digital rights advocacy group, La Quadrature du Net, French Data Network and the Fédération FDN, brought an action for annulment of the European Commission decision on the adequacy of the Privacy Shield before the Court of Justice of the EU (Case T‑738/16). The case is currently pending before the European Court of Justice. If the Court of Justice of the EU invalidates the Privacy Shield, it will no longer be possible to rely on the Privacy Shield certification to transfer personal data from the EU to entities in the United States. Adherence to the Privacy Shield is not, however, mandatory. Entities based in the United States are permitted to rely either on their adherence to the Privacy Shield or on the other authorized means and procedures to transfer personal data provided by the GDPR.
 Healthcare Reform
 A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States.
 By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the ACA, which, among other things, 

 
  75

 
includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential drug candidates are:

· | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee does not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | introduction of a price reporting requirement for drugs that are inhaled, instilled, implanted, injected, or infused and not generally dispensed through retail community pharmacies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | addition of more entity types eligible for participation in the Public Health Service 340B drug pricing program, or the 340B program;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point‑of‑sale‑discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new Patient‑Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs and biologics, were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2027.
 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, and certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges.  In addition, there have been efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA and to alter the implementation of the ACA and related laws.   For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly referred to as the “individual mandate,” effective January 1, 2019. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 among other things, amended the Medicare statute, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly known as the “donut hole,” by raising the manufacturer discount under the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program to 70%.  Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, and judicial challenges related to the ACA remain possible, but the nature and extent of such potential additional changes are uncertain at this time. It is unclear how the ACA and its implementation, as well as efforts to repeal or replace, or invalidate, the ACA, or portions thereof, will affect our business.It is possible that the ACA, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other 

 
  76

 
healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved.
