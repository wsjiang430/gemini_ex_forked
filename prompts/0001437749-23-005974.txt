ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Unless the context indicates otherwise, or unless specifically stated otherwise, references to the “Company”, “PlayAGS”, “AGS”, “we”, “our” and “us” refer to PlayAGS, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
We are a Nevada corporation formed and incorporated originally in Delaware in August 2013 and then reincorporated in Nevada in December 2017. We were formed to acquire, through one of our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, 100% of the equity in AGS Capital, LLC (“AGS Capital”) from AGS Holdings, LLC (“AGS Holdings”). AGS Capital was a supplier of Electronic Gaming Machines (“EGMs”) primarily to Class II Native American gaming jurisdictions.
 
We are a leading designer and supplier of EGMs and other products and services for the gaming industry. Since 2014, we have expanded our product line-up to include: (i) Class III EGMs for commercial and Native American casinos permitted to operate Class III EGMs, (ii) EGMs that use the results of historical horse races ("HHR") in their game math, which are allowed in several niche markets and raceways, (iii) table game products and (iv) interactive products, all of which we believe provide us with growth opportunities as we expand in markets where we currently have limited or no presence. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 72% of our total revenue was generated through recurring contracted lease agreements whereby we place EGMs and table game products at our customers’ gaming facilities under either a revenue sharing agreement (we receive a percentage of the revenues that these products generate) or fee-per-day agreement (we receive a daily or monthly fixed fee per EGM or table game product), or recurring revenue from our Interactive gaming operations. We operate our business in three distinct segments: EGMs, Table Products and Interactive. Each segment's activities include the design, development, acquisition, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, installation and servicing of a distinct product line.
 
Our Operations
 
We provide customers with EGMs, table products, ancillary table product equipment, systems software, computer hardware, signage and other equipment for operation within their gaming facilities. In return we receive either cash for sold items, or a share of the revenue generated by these products and systems, either as a flat monthly fee or a daily fee. The determination of whether our agreement results in a revenue share, monthly fee, or daily fee arrangement is generally governed by local gaming jurisdictions. For our revenue share arrangements on EGM products, we have historically shared between 15% and 20% of the revenues generated by the EGMs. Under our agreements for EGMs, we participate in selecting the mix of titles, maintain and service the equipment and oversee certain promotional efforts. When sold, we offer the majority of our products with an optional parts and service contract. For Table Products we typically license table games and lease related equipment for which we receive monthly royalty and lease payments. We also lease and sell roulette and baccarat signs as well as a single deck card shuffler for poker tables, Dex S, and our new second shuffler, the Pax S single-deck shuffler. Our Interactive segment generates revenues from (1) real-money gaming (“RMG”) revenues, which are earned primarily based on a percentage of the revenue produced by the games we offer to to our online casino customers, (2) business-to-customer ("B2C") social products where consumers purchase virtual coins used to play social casino games and (3) business-to-business ("B2B") social products where we obtain a percentage of monthly revenue generated by the white label casino apps that we build and operate for our customers. In support of our business and operations, we employ a professional staff including field service technicians, production, sales, account management, marketing, technology and game development, licensing and compliance and finance.
 
Our corporate headquarters are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, which serves as the primary location for the executive management and administrative functions such as finance, legal, human resources, licensing and compliance. Our licensing and compliance division oversees the application and renewal of our corporate gaming licenses, findings of suitability for key officers and directors. Our product compliance and jurisdictional engineering division located in Atlanta oversees certification of our gaming equipment and systems for specific jurisdictions as well as coordinating gaming equipment and software shipping and on-site and remote service of our equipment with gaming authorities.
 
Our field service technicians are responsible for installing, maintaining and servicing our gaming products and systems. Our EGM and Table Products field service operation including our call center, which operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, is managed out of our Oklahoma facility. We can also access most of our Class II EGMs and systems remotely from approved remote locations to provide software updates and routine maintenance. In addition, our EGM and system production facilities are located in and managed out of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Atlanta, Georgia, and Mexico City, Mexico. 
 
Sales, product management and account management are managed through our various locations and are located throughout the jurisdictions in which we do business. Sales and account management oversee the customer relationship at the individual location as well as at the corporate level and are responsible for developing new customer relationships. Account management is in charge of running on-site promotions and corporate sponsorship programs. In addition, our marketing team is in charge of general corporate marketing, including advertisements and participation at industry trade shows.
 
We employ game developers, software and system programmers, project managers and other development and administrative staff that oversee our internal game development efforts and manage third party relationships. Our EGM technology and game development operates primarily out of our Atlanta, Georgia, and Sydney, Australia locations and to a lesser extent out of our locations in Las Vegas, Nevada, Austin, Texas, Reno, Nevada, and Scottsdale, Arizona and independent contractors in Noida, India. Our Table Products technology and development operates primarily out of our Las Vegas, Nevada location. We have Interactive development teams in Tel Aviv, Israel and, Hinckley, United Kingdom, and independent contractors in Kiev, Ukraine and Noida, India. 
 
Products
 
    We provide our casino customers with HHR, Class II and Class III EGMs for the tribal and commercial gaming markets, as well as more than 60 unique table products offerings, ancillary table products equipment, systems software, computer hardware, signage, and other equipment for operation within gaming facilities such as our newly introduced card shufflers. In our Interactive segment, we offer a library of games for online casino operators, a library of casino-themed social and mobile games, and B2B social casino solutions available to land-based casino customers.

EGM Segment
 
EGMs constitute our largest segment, representing 91.9% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. In 2022, we had a library of over 550 proprietary game titles that we offer for delivery on our EGM cabinets. These include our premium lease-only cabinets Orion Starwall, Orion Curve Premium, Orion Rise, and Big Red ("Colossal Diamonds"). Also, our core cabinets that are available for sale and lease include the newly released Spectra UR43, as well as the Orion Portrait, Orion Slant, Orion Curve, Orion Upright and ICON. In addition to providing complete EGM units, we offer conversion kits, which are essentially software containing new games that allow existing game titles to be converted to other game titles offered within that operating platform and on an existing cabinet.
 
We design all of our cabinets with the intention of capturing the attention of players on casino floors while aiming to maximize operator profits. We offer our customers the option of either leasing or purchasing our EGMs and associated gaming systems. Currently, we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from EGMs installed under revenue sharing or fee-per-day lease agreements, also known as “participation” agreements, and we refer to such revenue generation as our “participation model”. 
 
Our core game titles are targeted at maintaining and growing our current installed base and we believe that it is the performance of these game titles that our customers value. Our top-performing game titles include Rakin' Bacon! and a version used only on our premium games called Rakin' Bacon Deluxe. In addition to these titles we have hundreds of additional titles that we design our core titles to provide a universal appeal to casino patrons. Our game studios are focused on continually producing new content that is then released to the market on a regular basis. We deliver our content on the cabinets below:
 
Premium - Lease-Only Cabinets

Core - For Sale and Lease Cabinets
 
Spectra UR43 - The Spectra UR43 presents a 43-inch ultra HD 4k portrait monitor outlined with clean game-controlled eclipse lighting.

Orion Portrait - The Orion Portrait is the flagship of the Orion cabinet family.

Orion Upright - In 2019, we launched the Orion Upright, which provides us with a third dual-screen option, a form factor widely represented on casino floors.

Table Products Segment
 
We offer our customers more than 60 unique table products, including live felt table games, side bets, progressives, card shufflers, signage, and other ancillary table game equipment. Our table products are designed to enhance the table games section of the casino floor (commonly known as “the pit”). Our table products segment offers a full suite of side bets and specialty table games as well as progressive technology products that provide this enhancement and increase gaming activity and holds for our casino customers. We believe that this segment will serve as an important growth engine for our company by generating further cross-selling opportunities with our EGM offerings. As of December 31, 2022, we had placed 5,051 table products domestically and internationally. Based on the number of products placed, we believe we are presently a leading supplier of table products to the gaming industry.
Progressives:
 Bonus Spin Blackjack is a first-of-its kind wheel-based table product progressive side-bet solution that uses built-in, light-up bet sensors, a tablet-style dealer interface, and a progressive engine that is fully customizable. Operators can offer anything from a progressive top prize, a fixed top prize, or an experience-based top prize. Sophisticated 3D graphics and a double-sided display draws players into the game and show prizes, results, and bet limits. By adding Bonus Spin Blackjack to any of their table products, operators can instantly be more effective at marketing their games by offering customizable prizes that target specific player segments, resulting in more player excitement, interaction, and a potential increase in revenues and visits. In addition, Bonus Spin can be easily added to any of our table products, providing substantial growth opportunities. 
 
Due to our success with Bonus Spin Blackjack, we introduced an upgraded table game progressive side bet system called Bonus Spin Xtreme. This next generation of Bonus Spin features three concentric wheels, enabling Bonus Spin Xtreme to award all participating players with a community prize, as well as award one player position with an enhanced prize which may be a progressive jackpot. Bonus Spin Xtreme can link all community-style table games like roulette, baccarat, and craps, while enabling all participating players to be rewarded with a community prize games within a casino and offer a single shared progressive jackpot – a feat which has not previously been accomplished with any product in any casino. 
 
Another AGS progressive innovation is the STAX Progressive, which offers multi-level and must-hit-by progressive jackpots that can be added to basic table games like blackjack, as well as AGS proprietary table games like Criss Cross Poker and Jackpot Hold'em. STAX Progressive, has an eye-catching, colorful display and advertises the progressive levels with the opportunity for players to win more and we have enhanced it further with new features in high demand by casino operators including wide area progressive functionality with single and multi-site meters. 
 
Side-bets:
 Our top-performing side-bet games include Buster Blackjack, Lucky Lucky, In-Bet, Push Your Luck, and Trifecta Blackjack. These side bets provide additional excitement for existing table games and encourage players to wager more money, thus creating more revenue for our casino customers. 
 
Premium specialty table games:
 Our premium game titles, among other, include Criss Cross Poker, Jackpot Hold’em and Chase The Flush. This segment of the table product business provides an area for growth and expansion in the marketplace, as the industry’s revenues are currently primarily dominated by a single competitor, and we have recently expanded our sales efforts to cover greater territory. The game mechanics of our proprietary, premium titles take classic public domain games and offer a twist on game play that increases volatility while simultaneously increasing hold for operators. This means players experience larger wins, which keeps them engaged in the games for longer periods of time, and operators have the potential to earn incremental revenue.
Shufflers and Utility:
 One of the newer areas of our Table Products segment consists of ancillary equipment offerings to table games, such as card shufflers, table signage, and our ACOT chip tray, which provide casino operators a greater variety of choice in the marketplace. This product segment includes baccarat signage, animated roulette readerboards, and our highly anticipated single-card shufflers, Dex S for poker tables and the PAX S for specialty tables. These shufflers feature a streamlined design with fewer moving parts, making them exceptionally functional, economical, and reliable, and they easily fit into existing table cutouts so casino operators can seamlessly install without changing their current layouts or replacing any tables. We believe that the table equipment area of our business holds many opportunities for growth, as the technology currently installed in the signage and readerboard areas are in a replacement cycle.
Interactive Segment
 
We operate a Business-to-Business ("B2B") game aggregation platform for online real-money gaming ("RMG") operators. Through our remote gaming server, we deliver a library of more than 1,000 games, many of which are AGS titles, developed by our internal game-development studios. We also partner with a host of third-party game developers to offer game content across mobile, desktop, and social channels – delivering an experience wherever and whenever players want to engage.
 
AGS also offers Business-to-Consumer (“B2C”) free-to-play social casino apps that players across the globe can enjoy anytime online or on their mobile device. Our B2C social casino games operate on a free-to-play model, whereby game players may collect virtual currency or other virtual consumable goods (collectively referred to as “virtual goods” or “virtual currency”) free of charge or the player may purchase additional virtual goods. Our social casino library includes a variety of game titles including video slots, spinning reels, video poker, blackjack, bingo, and tournaments. Our most popular app, Lucky Play Casino, offers mobile players all the thrills of Vegas casinos. Players can choose from dozens of AGS player-favorite slot games, as well as other casino classics like video poker, blackjack, and bingo. Our apps also feature in-app tournaments, rumbles, VIP bonuses, and unique interactive challenges.
 
Other Segment Information
 
Customers and marketing. We market our products to casinos and other legal gaming establishments around the world with our domestic and international sales force and several domestic and international distributors and/or representatives. We believe the quality and breadth of our customer base is a strong testament to the effectiveness and performance of our product offerings, technological innovation, and customer service. Our customer base includes leading casino operators in leading established gaming markets such as the United States, Canada, and Latin America. Our customers include large tribal customers like the Chickasaw Nation and well-known corporate customers such as MGM Resorts, Caesars Entertainment, as well as many other commercial and tribal casinos.

Our products and the locations in which we may sell them are subject to the licensing and product approval requirements by various national, state, provincial, and tribal jurisdictional agencies that regulate gaming around the world.  See “Regulation and Licensing” section below. We lease and sell our products, with an emphasis on leasing versus selling. We service the products we lease and offer service packages to customers who purchase products from us.
 
Product supply. We obtain most of the parts for our products from outside suppliers, including both off-the-shelf items as well as components manufactured to our specifications. We also manufacture parts in-house that are used for product assembly and for servicing existing products. We generally perform warehousing, quality control, final assembly and shipping from our facilities in Atlanta, Mexico City and Oklahoma City, although small inventories are maintained and repairs are performed by our field service employees. We believe that our sources of supply for components and raw materials are adequate and that alternative sources of materials are available. These sources may be affected by adverse global factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Manufacturing
 
Manufacturing commitments are generally based on projected quarterly demand from customers. We have manufacturing agreements to build our gaming cabinets with multiple manufacturing vendors. We believe we have limited concentration risk with any one of these vendors, because we own the rights to our cabinet designs and thus have the ability to change manufacturers in the event of a dispute. We believe any of these vendors would be able to build our gaming cabinets for titles on any platform.  As the supplier base is large, we are able to gain competitive pricing and delivery on any of our cabinets and have limited risk in supply disruptions. However, as a result of the disruption in global supply chains precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical unrest, there has been an increase in the price of components used in our EGMs and a significant increase in freight costs for the transportation of our products.
 
Our primary EGM and Table Products production facility is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Production at this facility includes assembling and refurbishing gaming machines, parts support and purchasing. We also assemble EGMs in our Mexico City, Mexico facility at lower volume to support the Mexican market. System production is based at our Atlanta, Georgia office, where our system design team and our U.S. research and development team are based. 
 
Field service technicians are located in various jurisdictions throughout the United States and Mexico and are dispatched from centralized call centers. They are responsible for installing, maintaining and servicing the EGMs, table games and systems.
 
Customers
 
We believe the quality and breadth of our customer base is a strong testament to the effectiveness and quality of our product offerings, technological innovation and customer service. At the core of our relationship with our customers is our participation model, which aligns our financial incentives with those of our customers through a shared dependence on the games’ performance. The combination of our customer-aligned participation model, quality customer service and strong game performance has allowed us to develop long-term relationships with our tribal and commercial casino customers. Our top participation customers have been with us for more than a decade, and we believe that we maintain long-term relationships with key customer decision-makers.
 
We have historically offered select existing and prospective customers an upfront payment, or placement fee, in exchange for exclusive rights to a percentage of their floor space. To a lesser extent, we have offered financing for casino development and expansion projects. In addition to our long-term relationships and contractual arrangements, the consistent demand for our games from the loyal, repeat players of our games further ensures our strong presence on our customers’ casino floors.
 
Within the Native American tribal market, we provide both Class II and Class III games. We also serve customers in commercial, video lottery terminal, charity bingo and route-based markets.
 
Oklahoma is our largest market and our gaming products in the state accounted for approximately 22% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Texas and Washington are our second and third largest domestic markets and our gaming products in these states each accounted for approximately 8% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.  
 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we did not receive more than 10% of our total revenue from any one customer.
 
Customer Contracts
 
We derive the majority of our gaming revenues from participation agreements, whereby we place EGMs and systems, along with our proprietary and other licensed game content, at a customer’s facility in return for either a share of the revenues that these EGMs and systems generate or a daily fee. For licensed table products and related equipment, we typically receive monthly royalty and lease payments. We measure the performance of our domestic installed base of participation EGMs on the net win per day per machine, often referred to as the win per day, or “WPD”. Under our participation agreements, we earn a percentage of the win per day of our domestic installed base of participation EGMs.
 
Our standard contracts are no longer than one to three years in duration and may contain auto-renewal provisions for an additional term. Most of our contracts give the customer the ability to cancel the lease and return the games to the Company, a provision which renders the contracts effectively month-to-month contracts. Our contracts generally specify the number of EGMs and other equipment to be provided, revenue share, daily fee or other pricing, provisions regarding installation, training, service and removal of the machines, and other terms and conditions standard in the industry. In some circumstances, we enter into trial agreements with customers that provide a free or fee-based trial period, during which such customers may use our EGMs or table products. Each trial agreement lays out the terms of payment should the customer decide to continue using our machines.
 
The Company enters into development agreements and placement fee agreements with certain customers to secure floor space under lease agreements for its gaming machines. Amounts paid in connection with the development agreements are repaid to the Company in accordance with the terms of the agreement, whereas placements fees are not reimbursed. For development agreements in the form of a loan, interest income is recognized on the repayment of the loan based on the stated rate or, if not stated explicitly in the development agreement, on an imputed interest rate. If the stated interest rate is deemed to be other than a market rate or zero, a discount is recorded on the loan receivable as a result of the difference between the stated and market rate and a corresponding intangible asset is recorded. These agreements have typically been longer-term contracts, ranging from four to seven years depending on the amount of financing provided, market, and other factors.
 
    4 

 

We generally make efforts to obtain waivers of sovereign immunity in our contracts with Native American customers. However, we do not always obtain these provisions and when we do, they can be limited in scope. There is no guarantee that we will continue or improve our ability to get this term in future contracts. While we have not had any experience with contract enforceability vis-à-vis our Native American customers, we are cognizant of recent cases involving other parties dealing with waivers of sovereign immunity. Those cases put into question how sovereign immunity may be viewed by courts in the future. In the event that we enter into contracts with Native American customers in the future that do not contain a waiver of sovereign immunity, such contracts may be practically unenforceable.
 
Our game sale contracts are typical of those in the industry. They specify the general terms and conditions of the sale, equipment and services to be provided, as well as pricing and payment terms. In some cases, we provide the central server that is used to operate the purchased equipment on a lease and charge a fee-per-day based on the number of gaming machines connected to the server.
 
For our Interactive segment, we enter into agreements whereby revenues are generated from (1) real-money gaming (“RMG”) revenues, which are earned primarily based on a percentage of the revenue produced by the games we offer to to our online casino customers, (2) business-to-customer ("B2C") social products where consumers purchase virtual coins used to play social casino games and (3) business-to-business ("B2B") social products where we obtain a percentage of monthly revenue generated by the white label casino apps that we build and operate for our customers.
 
Research and Development
 
We conduct research and development through an internal team to develop new gaming systems and gaming content. Research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits, travel and expenses and other professional services. As of December 31, 2022, we employ 324 game developers, software and system programmers, project managers and other development and administrative staff that oversee internal game development efforts and manage third party relationships. The technology and game development division for the EGM segment operates primarily out of our Atlanta, Georgia, Austin, Texas, Reno, Nevada, Scottsdale, Arizona and Sydney, Australia locations with independent contractors also assisting in India. Our studio in Las Vegas, Nevada primarily supports our Table Products segment. We also have development and support teams for our Interactive segment in Tel Aviv, Israel. Additionally, we hire independent contractors in India and Ukraine to support the online operations of AGS iGaming. The Company does not have customer-sponsored research and development costs.
Intellectual Property
 
We use a combination of internally developed and third-party intellectual property, all of which we believe maintain and enhance our competitive position and protect our products. Such intellectual property includes owned or licensed patents, patent applications, trademarks, and trademark applications in the United States. In addition, we have rights in intellectual property in certain foreign jurisdictions. Some of these rights, however, are shared with third parties, including in an industry wide manufacturers’ patent pool. Additionally, pursuant to our license agreements with third-party game developers, we license and distribute gaming software. We also have pooling arrangements with third parties, whereby all parties to such arrangement are permitted to use certain intellectual property contributed to the pool.
Competition
 
We encounter competition from other designers, manufacturers and operators of EGMs, table products, social casino and real-money gaming games. Our competitors range from small, localized companies to large, multi-national corporations, several of which have substantial resources and market share.
 
Our competitors for the live casino floor gaming machines include, but are not limited to, International Game Technology PLC (“IGT”), Light & Wonder, Inc. (formerly known as Scientific Games Corporation), Aristocrat Technologies Inc. (“Aristocrat”), Everi Holdings Inc. (“Everi”), Konami Co. Ltd. (“Konami”), Ainsworth Game Technology Ltd., and Galaxy Gaming, Inc. Additionally, there are hundreds of non-gaming companies that design and develop social casino games and apps and real-money gaming products and services. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources and have been engaged in the design, manufacture and operation of gaming products for many years. Some of these companies contain significant intellectual property including patents in gaming technology and hardware design, systems and game play and trademarks. In addition, the larger competitors contain significantly larger content portfolios and content development capability and resources, are licensed in markets throughout the United States, and have international distribution. IGT, Light & Wonder, Inc., Aristocrat, and Konami all have a presence in the back-office accounting and player tracking business which expands their relationship with casino customers. Aristocrat and Everi are our primary competitors in the Class II market.
 
To compete effectively, we must, among other things, continue to develop high-performing, innovative games for the Class II and Class III markets, provide excellent service and support to our existing customers, effectively manage our installed base of participation gaming machines, expand our library of proprietary content, develop niche products with strong appeal to both local and next generation players, be first to market in new non-traditional markets, implement effective marketing and sales functions, and offer competitive pricing and terms on our participation and sale agreements.
 
Seasonality
 
We experience fluctuations in revenues and cash flows from quarter to quarter, as our operating results have been highest during the first and second quarters and lowest in our third and fourth quarters, primarily due to the seasonality of player demand. These fluctuations, however, do not have a material impact on our revenues and cash flows.
Inflation and Cost Fluctuations
 
Our operational expansion is affected by the cost of hardware components, which are not considered to be inflation sensitive in the long term, but rather, sensitive to changes in technology and competition in the hardware markets. However, as a result of the disruption in global supply chains precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic and other geopolitical disruptions, there has been an increase in the price of components used in our EGMs and certain Table Products, as well as a significant increase in freight costs for the transportation of our products. In addition, we expect to continue to incur increased legal and other similar costs associated with regulatory compliance requirements and the uncertainties present in the operating environment in which we conduct our business.

Human Capital Management
  AGS is a global company with offices and employees in Australia, Canada, Israel, Brazil, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of December 31, 2022, we had 659 full-time employees in the United States, 143 full-time employees in Mexico, 69 full-time employees in Australia, 5 full-time employees in Israel, 9 full-time employees in the United Kingdom, 5 full-time employees in Canada, and 2 full-time employees in Brazil.  
 
The Company believes that our employees are a strategic business advantage and as such, we place a high value on delivering a positive employee experience and an engaging employee culture that enables us to attract, retain, and reward our employees. We faced the COVID-19 pandemic with confidence and the belief that maintaining engagement with our greatest asset, our employees, would pay dividends when we emerge from the pandemic. In 2022, our business continued to recover from the pandemic, and we benefitted from the actions that we took during the pandemic to continue to foster our inclusive employee-centric culture. The actions that benefitted us and that we continued throughout 2022 include the following:
 

• | We continued to offer benefits to our employees that help them navigate our current hybrid working model. These benefits include employee assistance programs as well as mental and emotional resilience resources to enhance our employees' well-being.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We regularly engaged with our employees through townhall meetings led by our Chief Executive Officer, David Lopez.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We also took decisive actions early in the pandemic to ensure the safety of our employees by transitioning our workforce, where feasible, to a remote working environment and we are continuing to ensure that our hybrid working model is operating responsibly and safely.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employee Culture
 
The Company’s employee-focused culture provides greater job satisfaction, collaboration, work performance, and employee morale, which in turn results in empowered and productive employees. This has been recognized by the Company’s receipt of various employee engagement awards based on employee feedback through confidential surveys and reviews, such as the prestigious ‘Best and Brightest Companies to Work For in the Nation®’ (every year from 2017 to 2022); ‘Atlanta’s Best and Brightest Companies to Work For®’ (every year from 2017 to 2022); Glassdoor’s ‘Best Places to Work’ in 2020; and recognition in the ‘Nevada Top Workplaces’ and ‘Atlanta Top Workplaces’ in 2020.
 
We believe that we foster an engaged employee culture by having a clear mission and strong core values, focused on innovation, trust, respect, empowerment, service, and honesty. Our community focus means that we give back to our communities and work to strengthen them.
 
The Company provides a flexible work environment and allows remote work whenever practical to our business, which, we believe, makes our employees more dedicated and engaged because they are trusted to meet their deliverables in a manner that provides work-life balance and accommodates their lifestyles. AGS also prioritizes employee communication, through regular town halls delivered by our CEO and other executives; frequent email communications; a SharePoint site with easily accessible Company information; the Companywide use of Microsoft Teams for meetings, virtual events, documents and information sharing, and chat; a focus on leveraging our internal corporate social network for employee engagement and communication; and a dedicated group of employees called Culture Crew who plan and execute employee engagement, appreciation and community service events.
 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 
The diversity of ideas, perspectives, skills, knowledge, and cultures across the Company facilitates innovation, is a key competitive advantage, and, we believe, is one of our strengths. We are committed to continuing to make diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do – including providing a workforce that creates a sense of belonging and opportunities for everyone.
 
At AGS, our diverse workforce is why we continue to win awards for our employee culture and our innovation. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 28% of the Company’s global workforce was female, which is consistent with current trends in our industry, and 24% of the Company’s employees in managerial roles were female. As of December 31, 2022, minorities represented approximately 44% of the Company’s global workforce, of which 33% of our global employees in managerial roles were minorities. Within the Company’s C-Suite, which comprises our senior executive team, 29% of our leaders were women and 57% were minorities. In addition, there are two women who serve on our Board of Directors comprising more than 30% of our Board. Annually, AGS participates in the ‘Best and Brightest Companies to Work For’ program which conducts an anonymous employee questionnaire and benchmarks the Company’s human resource practices compared to other companies in the region and across the nation. In 2022, U.S. employees rated AGS 95.5% in the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion category, 4.2% higher than the national average.
 
The Company has a diversity, equity, and inclusion task force called I.D.E.A. Squad. I.D.E.A. is short for “Inclusion, Diversity, Equality & Acceptance.” The task force is comprised of employees from across multiple departments and across the globe, with executive involvement from the Chief Executive Officer, as well as other senior leaders. The role of this task force is to empower people, inside the Company and in our communities, by respecting, embracing, and socializing what makes us different, no matter our age, gender, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, education, and national origin. The task force focuses on four key issues:
 
•  Creating opportunities in underprivileged communities;
 •  Encouraging diversity of thought;
 •  Promoting education on the topics of racism and discrimination; and
 •  Celebrating diversity across various channels.
 
The Company conducts annual mandatory diversity training for all employees focused on diversity on the job and the changing workplace. This training defines diversity, provides coursework on how to leverage the diversity that exists within an organization, and dispels common myths that surround the topic of diversity. For our employees of color identified as future leaders, we also offer participation in McKinsey Black Leadership Academy’s Management Accelerator. This program is designed to help equip our aspiring leaders of color with the capabilities, mindsets, behaviors, and network needed to achieve their professional aspirations — focusing on building core management and leadership capabilities. 
 
AGS also makes diversity and inclusion a strategic recruiting priority through our partnership with JobTarget, which automatically posts our open positions to various online job boards targeting diverse candidates including people of color, women, people living with disabilities, and other protected and/or underrepresented job seekers.
 
Veteran Recruitment & Support
 
We are committed to hiring veterans, empowering those veterans in transition to the civilian sector, and supporting our veterans and their families in their communities. The Company actively recruits for qualified military veterans by posting our open positions on MilitaryVetJobs, Veterans Enterprise, JOFDAV – Job Opportunities for Disabled American Veterans, Hire Our Heroes, US Military, and RallyPoint. Thirty-three percent (33%) of our C-Suite, and seven percent (7%) of our U.S. employee base, served in the military. Because of their backgrounds and experience, we believe, veterans bring leadership, technical skills, and a spirit of collaboration to AGS. Once employed with AGS, the Company gives veterans the opportunity to make the most of their skills and abilities. We partner with America’s Warrior Partnership, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering communities through helping veterans and their families find the services and support they need in their local communities. The Company also actively supports veterans through Operation Gratitude and other organizations and outreach.
 
Competitive pay and benefits
 
AGS’ compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with the Company’s performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve growth goals. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance, specifically:
 

• | We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge, and geographic location.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We align our executives’ long-term equity compensation with our shareholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with stock and Company performance.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | All full-time employees are eligible for medical, dental, and vision insurance, paid and unpaid leave, a 401(k) retirement plan that includes Company match, and life and disability/accident coverage. We also offer flexible time-off, paid marriage, maternity, and supporting parental leave, fertility and family planning benefits, wellness programs, employee assistance programs, and tuition reimbursement.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | From time to time, with Board approval, the Company grants employees ownership opportunities in the Company through equity-based awards.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patent Incentive Program 
 
The establishment and maintenance of a strong patent portfolio is a corporate objective of the Company. To stimulate inventions that lead to patentable subject matter, the company has adopted a patent award program for awards and additional recognition to be given to active AGS employees who are listed as an inventor on certain patents or patent applications.
 
We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements in the United States and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages in the past.

Regulation and Licensing
 
Licensing and Suitability Determinations
 
We operate in numerous gaming jurisdictions, and our business operations, which include the manufacture, sale, and distribution, of gaming devices, gaming related equipment, related software and/or the provision of gaming related services, are subject to extensive federal, state, local, tribal and foreign government regulation as applicable in each of the gaming jurisdictions in which we operate. A significant portion of our operations take place at facilities conducting gaming activities on the tribal lands of Native American tribes resulting in our operations being subject to tribal and/or federal and sometimes state regulation depending on the classification of gaming being conducted in each such case as defined in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (“IGRA”). In states where commercial gaming has been legalized, our operations are conducted subject to the applicable federal, state, and local government regulation.
 
While the specific regulatory requirements of the various jurisdictions vary, the gaming laws in most jurisdictions require us, each of our subsidiaries engaged in manufacturing, selling and distributing gaming products and services, our directors, officers and employees and, in some cases, certain entities or individuals who hold some level of beneficial ownership, typically 5% or more, in the Company or its affiliates as well as our lenders and other individuals or entities affiliated with us (contractually or otherwise) to obtain a license, permit, finding of suitability or other approval from gaming authorities. Gaming authorities have broad discretion in determining whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be deemed suitable and the burden of demonstrating suitability and the cost of the investigation is the responsibility of the applicant. While the criteria vary between jurisdictions, generally, in determining whether to grant or renew a license, the gaming authorities will consider the good character, honesty and integrity of the applicant and the financial ability, integrity and responsibility of the applicant. For individual applicants, gaming authorities consider the individual’s business experience and reputation for good character, the individual’s criminal history and the character of those with whom the individual associates. Qualification and suitability determinations for individuals requires the individual to submit detailed personal and financial information to the gaming authority, followed by a thorough background investigation. Gaming authorities may deny an application for licensing or a determination of suitability for any cause which they deem reasonable. If one or more gaming authorities were to find that an officer, director or key employee fails to qualify or is unsuitable to participate in the gaming industry in such jurisdiction, we would be required to sever all relationships with such person. Additionally, gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. The gaming regulators having jurisdiction over us have broad power over our business operations and may deny, revoke, suspend, condition, limit, or not renew our gaming or other licenses, permits or approvals, impose substantial fines and take other action, any one of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operation. We believe we and our officers, directors, managers, key employees and affiliates have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all required gaming related licenses, permits, findings of suitability and other forms of approvals necessary to carry on our business.
 
It is common for gaming regulators to monitor, or to require us to disclose, our activities and any disciplinary actions against us in other gaming jurisdictions. Consequently, the business activities or disciplinary actions taken against us in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary actions in other jurisdictions.
 
Licensing Requirements of Security Holders
 
In some jurisdictions in which we operate, certain of our stockholders or holders of our debt securities may be required to undergo a suitability determination or background investigation. Many jurisdictions require any person who acquires, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of our voting securities, generally 5% or more, to report the acquisition of the ownership interest and the gaming authorities may require such holder to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability. Most jurisdictions allow an “institutional investor” to apply for a waiver from such requirements provided that the institutional investor holds the ownership interest in the ordinary course of its business and for passive investment purposes only. Generally, an “institutional investor” includes an investor who is a bank, insurance company, investment company, investment advisor, or pension fund. In some jurisdictions, an application for a waiver as an institutional investor requires the submission of detailed information concerning the institutional investor and its business including, among other things, the name of each person that beneficially owns more than 5% of the voting securities of such institutional investor. If such a waiver is granted, then the institutional investor may acquire, in most cases, up to 10% of our voting securities without applying for a finding of suitability or qualification and, in some cases, a higher percentage of beneficial ownership. Even if a waiver is granted, an institutional investor may not take any action inconsistent with its status when the waiver is granted without becoming subject to a suitability determination or background investigation. A change in the investment intent of the institutional investor requires immediate reporting to the respective gaming authorities.
 
Notwithstanding the 5% ownership threshold, gaming authorities have broad discretion and each person who acquires, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of any voting security or beneficial or record ownership of any nonvoting security of any debt security of ours may be required to be found suitable if a gaming authority has reason to believe that such person’s acquisition of that ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policy of the jurisdiction.
 
Generally, any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within the prescribed period of time after being advised that such a finding or license is required by a gaming authority may be denied a license or be found unsuitable. The same restrictions may also apply to a record owner if the record owner, after being requested, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any person denied a license or found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership interest in us beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by the applicable gaming authorities may be guilty of a criminal offense. Additionally, we may be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have a relationship with us or any of our subsidiaries, we:
 

• | pay that person any dividend or interest upon our voting securities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fail to pursue all lawful efforts to terminate our relationship with that person including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of said voting securities for cash at fair market value.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In light of these regulations and their potential impact on our business, our amended and restated articles of incorporation contain provisions establishing our right to redeem the securities of disqualified holders if necessary to avoid any regulatory sanctions, to prevent the loss or to secure the reinstatement of any license, permit or approval, or if such holder is determined by any gaming authority to be unsuitable, has an application for a license or permit denied or rejected or has a previously issued license or permit rescinded, suspended, revoked or not renewed. The amended and restated articles of incorporation also include provisions defining the redemption price of such securities and the rights of a disqualified security holder.
 
Testing and Approvals of our Gaming Products
 
Many jurisdictions require our gaming devices, related gaming equipment, software, and platform to be tested for compliance with the jurisdiction’s technical standards and regulations prior to our being permitted to distribute such devices, equipment, software and platform. The gaming authorities will conduct rigorous testing of our devices, equipment, software and platform through a testing laboratory which may be operated by the gaming authority or by an independent third party and may require a field trial of the device, equipment, software or platform before determining that it meets the gaming authority’s technical standards. As part of the approval process, a gaming authority may require us to modify, update, or revise our device, equipment, software or platform and the approval process may require several rounds before approval is ultimately granted. The time required for product testing can be extensive and the related costs can be significant.
 
Continued Reporting and Monitoring
 
In most jurisdictions, even though we are licensed or approved, we remain under the on-going obligation to provide financial information and reports as well as to keep the applicable gaming authorities informed of any material changes in the information provided to them as part of our licensing and approval process. Most licenses and approvals must be periodically renewed, in some cases as often as annually. In connection with any initial application or renewal of a gaming license or approval, we (and individuals or entities required to submit to background investigations or suitability determinations in connection with our application or renewal) are typically required to make broad and comprehensive disclosures concerning our history, finances, ownership and corporate structure, operations, compliance controls and business relationships. We must regularly report changes in our officers, key employees and other licensed positions to applicable gaming authorities.
 
Most gaming jurisdictions impose fees and taxes that are payable by us in connection with our application, maintenance and renewal of our licensure or our approval to conduct business. Laws, regulations, and ordinances governing our gaming related activities and the obligations of gaming companies in any jurisdiction in which we have or in the future may have gaming operations are subject to change that could impose additional operating, financial, or other burdens on our business.
 
Federal Registration
 
The Gambling Devices Act of 1962 makes it unlawful for a person to manufacture, transport, or receive gaming devices (including our products), or components across interstate lines unless that person has first registered with the Attorney General of the United States Department of Justice. This act also imposes gambling device identification and record keeping requirements. Violation of this act may result in seizure and forfeiture of the equipment, as well as other penalties. As an entity involved in the manufacture and transportation of gaming devices, we are required to register annually.
Native American Gaming Regulation
 
Gaming on Native American lands is governed by federal law, tribal-state compacts, and tribal gaming regulations. Federally, gaming on Native American lands is subject to IGRA, which is administered by the National Indian Gaming Commission (“NIGC”). Under IGRA, gaming activities conducted by federally recognized Native American tribes are segmented into three classes:

• | Class I, Class II and Class III.
--+---------------------------------

Class I. Class I gaming represents traditional forms of Native American gaming as part of, or in connection with, tribal ceremonies or celebrations (e.g., contests and games of skill) and social gaming for minimal prizes. Class I gaming is regulated only by each individual Native American tribe. We do not participate in any Class I gaming activities.
 
Class II. Class II gaming involves the game of chance commonly known as bingo (whether or not electronic, computer, or other technological aids are used in connection therewith to facilitate play) and if played in the same location as bingo, also includes pull tabs, punch board, tip jars, instant bingo, and other games similar to bingo. Class II gaming also includes non-banked card games, that is, games that are played exclusively against other players rather than against the house or a player acting as a bank such as poker. However, the definition of Class II gaming specifically excludes slot machines or electronic facsimiles of Class III games. Class II gaming is regulated by the NIGC and the ordinances and regulations of the Native American tribe conducting such gaming. Subject to the detailed requirements of IGRA, including NIGC approval of such Native American tribe’s gaming ordinance, federally recognized Native American tribes are typically permitted to conduct Class II gaming on Indian lands pursuant to tribal ordinances approved by the NIGC.
 
    8 

  

Class III. Class III gaming includes all other forms of gaming that are neither Class I nor Class II and includes a broad range of traditional casino games such as slot machines, blackjack, craps and roulette, as well as wagering games and electronic facsimiles of any game of chance. IGRA generally permits a Native American tribe to conduct Class III gaming activities on reservation lands subject to the detailed requirements of IGRA and provided that the Native American tribe has entered into a written agreement or compact with the state that specifically authorizes the types of Class III gaming the tribe may offer. The tribal-state compacts vary from state to state. Many such tribal-state compacts address the manner and extent to which the state or tribe will license manufacturers and suppliers of gaming devices and conduct background investigations and certify the suitability of persons such as officers, directors, key persons and, in some cases, shareholders of gaming device manufacturers and suppliers.
 
IGRA is administered by the NIGC and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior. The NIGC has authority to issue regulations related to tribal gaming activities, approve tribal ordinances for regulating gaming, approve management agreements for gaming facilities, conduct investigations and monitor tribal gaming generally. IGRA is subject to interpretation by the NIGC and may be subject to judicial and legislative clarification or amendment. The gaming ordinance of each Native American tribe conducting gaming under IGRA and the terms of any applicable tribal-state compact establish the regulatory requirements under which we must conduct business on Native American tribal lands.
 
Under IGRA, the NIGC’s authority to approve gaming-related contracts is limited to management contracts and collateral agreements related to management contracts. A “management contract” includes any agreement between a Native American tribe and a contractor if such contract or agreement provides for the management of all or part of a gaming operation. To the extent that any of our agreements with Native American tribes are deemed to be management contracts, such agreements would require the approval of the NIGC in order to be valid. To our knowledge, none of our current agreements with Native American tribes qualify as management contracts under IGRA.
 
In addition, to the extent that any of our agreements with Native American tribes are deemed by the NIGC to create an impermissible proprietary interest, such agreements are void and unenforceable. To our knowledge, none of our current agreements with Native American tribes create an impermissible proprietary interest in Indian gaming.
 
International Regulation
 
Certain foreign countries permit the importation, sale, and operation of gaming equipment, software and related equipment in casino and non-casino environments. Some countries prohibit or restrict the payout feature of the traditional slot machine or limit the operation and the number of slot machines to a controlled number of casinos or casino-like locations. Gaming equipment must comply with the individual country’s regulations. Certain jurisdictions do not require the licensing of gaming equipment operators and manufacturers. In Mexico, for example, gaming regulations have not been formalized and although we believe that we are compliant with the current informal regulations, if there are changes or new interpretations of the regulations in that jurisdiction we may be prevented or hindered from operating our business in Mexico.
Social Gaming Regulation
 
With respect to our social interactive gaming business, it is largely unregulated at this time. There are, however, movements in some jurisdictions to review social interactive gaming and possibly implement social interactive gaming regulations. We cannot predict the likelihood, timing, scope or terms of any such regulation or the extent to which any such regulation would affect our social interactive gaming business.
 
We are subject to various federal, state and international laws that affect our interactive business including those relating to the privacy and security of our customer and employee personal information and those relating to the Internet, behavioral tracking, mobile applications, advertising and marketing activities, sweepstakes and contests. Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which would result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our customers or deliver our products and services or may significantly increase our costs of compliance.
