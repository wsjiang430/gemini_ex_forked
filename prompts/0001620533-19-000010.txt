Item 1. Business.
Shake Shack Inc. was formed on September 23, 2014 as a Delaware corporation. Shake Shack Inc. Class A common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SHAK." Unless the context otherwise requires, "we," "us," "our," "Shake Shack," the "Company" and other similar references refer to Shake Shack Inc. and, unless otherwise stated, all of its subsidiaries, including SSE Holdings, LLC, which we refer to as "SSE Holdings." 
INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AND ORGANIZATIONAL TRANSACTIONS
On February 4, 2015, we completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of 5,750,000 shares of our Class A common stock at a public offering price of $21.00 per share, which includes 750,000 shares issued pursuant to the underwriters' over-allotment option. We received $112.3 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, which we used to purchase newly-issued membership interests from SSE Holdings at a price per interest equal to the initial public offering price of our Class A common stock of $21.00.
Shake Shack is a holding company with no direct operations and our principal asset is our equity interest in SSE Holdings. In connection with the IPO, we completed a series of organizational transactions, including the following:

▪ | We amended and restated the limited liability company agreement of SSE Holdings (as amended, the "SSE Holdings LLC Agreement") to, among other things, (i) provide for a new single class of common membership interests in SSE Holdings ("LLC Interests"), (ii) exchange all of the membership interests of the then-existing holders of SSE Holdings for LLC Interests and (iii) appoint Shake Shack as the sole managing member of SSE Holdings;


▪ | We amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to, among other things, (i) provide for Class B common stock with voting rights but no economic interests (where “economic interests” means the right to receive any distributions or dividends, whether cash or stock, in connection with common stock) and (ii) issue shares of Class B common stock to the then-existing members of SSE Holdings on a one-to-one basis with the number of LLC Interests they own;


▪ | We acquired, by merger, two entities that were owned by former indirect members of SSE Holdings, for which we issued 5,968,841 shares of Class A common stock as merger consideration (the "Mergers").

The above mentioned transactions as well as the other transactions completed in connection with the IPO are referred to collectively as the "Organizational Transactions."
Following the completion of the Organizational Transactions, we owned 33.3% of SSE Holdings. The non-controlling interest holders subsequent to the Mergers owned the remaining 66.7% of SSE Holdings. As a result of the Organizational Transactions, we became the sole managing member of SSE Holdings and, although we had a minority economic interest in SSE Holdings, we had the sole voting power in, and control the management of, SSE Holdings. Accordingly, we consolidated the financial results of SSE Holdings and reported a non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements.
As the Organizational Transactions are considered transactions between entities under common control, the financial statements for periods prior to the IPO and Organizational Transactions have been adjusted to combine the previously separate entities for presentation purposes.
Secondary Offering
In August 2015, we completed a secondary offering of 4,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock at a price of $60.00 per share. All of the shares sold in the offering were offered by certain non-controlling interest holders. We did not receive any proceeds 
2 | Shake Shack Inc.  Form 10-K

from the sale of shares of Class A common stock offered by the aforementioned non-controlling interest holders. The shares sold in the offering consisted of (i) 844,727 existing shares of Class A common stock held and (ii) 3,155,273 newly-issued shares of Class A common stock issued in connection with the redemption of 3,155,273 LLC Interests by the non-controlling interest holders that participated in the offering. Simultaneously, and in connection with the redemption, 3,155,273 shares of Class B common stock were surrendered by non-controlling interest holders and canceled. Additionally, in connection with the redemption, we received 3,155,273 LLC Interests, increasing our total ownership interest in SSE Holdings. 
USC Merger
Pursuant to a Stockholders Agreement, dated as of February 4, 2015, as amended, by and among Daniel H. Meyer and his affiliates (the "Meyer Group") and other parties thereto, the Meyer Group has the right to cause all of the stock of Union Square Cafe Corp. ("USC") and Gramercy Tavern Corp. ("GT") to be converted into and exchanged for shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to a tax-free reorganization (each, a "Reorganization"). In December 2015, the Meyer Group exercised their right with respect to USC. The Reorganization of USC was structured as a two-step merger, whereby (i) a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company merged with and into USC, then (ii) USC merged with and into the Company (the foregoing transactions are collectively referred to as the "USC Merger"). Prior to the USC Merger, USC owned 1,727,804 LLC Interests and an equivalent number of shares of our Class B common stock. In the USC Merger, (i) 1,727,804 shares of Class A common stock were issued to the stockholders of USC, with each stockholder receiving newly-issued shares of Class A common stock in an amount equivalent to the number of shares of USC held by such stockholders; (ii) 1,727,804 shares of Class B common stock held by USC were cancelled; and (iii) 1,727,804 LLC Interests held by USC were transferred to us. 
As of December 26, 2018, we owned 79.6% of SSE Holdings and the non-controlling interest holders own the remaining 20.4% of SSE Holdings.
OVERVIEW
Shake Shack is a modern day "roadside" burger stand serving a classic American menu of premium burgers, hot dogs, crispy chicken, frozen custard, crinkle cut fries, shakes, beer, wine and more. Originally founded by Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group ("USHG"), which owns and operates some of New York City's most acclaimed and popular restaurants—Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern, Blue Smoke, The Modern at the Museum of Modern Art, Maialino, Untitled, Marta, Martina, Daily Provisions, Tacocina, Manhatta and Intersect—Shake Shack originated as a hot dog cart in 2001 to support the rejuvenation of New York City's Madison Square Park through its Conservancy's first art installation, "I Y Taxi." The hot dog cart was an instant success, with lines forming daily throughout the summer months for the next three years. In response, the city's Department of Parks and Recreation awarded Shake Shack a contract to create a kiosk to help fund the park's future. In 2004, Shake Shack officially opened and immediately became a community gathering place for New Yorkers and visitors from all over the world and has since become a beloved New York City institution, garnering significant media attention, critical acclaim and a passionately-devoted following. Since its inception, Shake Shack has grown rapidly—with 208 Shacks, as of December 26, 2018, in 13 countries and 26 states, as well as the District of Columbia—and we continue to expand globally bringing the Shake Shack experience to new guests around the world. 
THE SHACK PACT
The Shack Pact™ is an agreement that our team makes at Shake Shack to lead our company with integrity, with purpose and with intention. It’s our mission and vision. Quite simply: it’s What We Do and Who We Are and it’s the ethos of our work each and every day as we grow Shake Shack. The Shack Pact is prominently displayed in the team member areas of every Shack, on the inside cover of the Shackademics™ book (our training manual) and is referenced and applied throughout daily shifts. 
WHAT WE DO:
We Stand For Something Good
Shake Shack Inc.  Form 10-K | 3

We strive to Stand For Something Good® in everything we do. That means carefully sourced premium ingredients from like-minded purveyors we admire and love; thoughtful, well-crafted and responsible design for its place; and deep community support through donations, events and volunteering.
WHO WE ARE:
We Are Boundless Hospitality
Hospitality is in our DNA. We take great pride in our culture and believe that it is the single most important factor in our success. Our mission to Stand For Something Good® permeates throughout every Shack we build, every ingredient we source and every team member we hire. We take care of each other first and foremost so that we can take care of our guests, our community, our suppliers and our investors. We aim to recruit people who have integrity, who are warm, friendly, motivated, caring, self-aware and intellectually curious—what we call "51%'ers." We use the term "51%" to describe the inherent interpersonal and emotional skills needed to thrive on the job and "49%" to describe the technical skills needed for the job. Our 51%'ers are excited and committed to champion performance, remarkable and enriching hospitality, embodying our culture, and actively growing themselves and the brand. Danny Meyer's original vision of Enlightened Hospitality™ guided the creation of the unique Shake Shack culture that, we believe, creates a differentiated experience for our guests at each of our Shacks around the world. Our team is trained to understand and practice the values of Enlightened Hospitality: caring for each other, caring for our guests, caring for our community, caring for our suppliers and caring for our investors. These principles have been championed by Danny Meyer throughout his career and are detailed in his New York Times best-selling book Setting the Table: The Transforming Power of Hospitality in Business, and they are fundamental to the way we operate our business.
The Bigger We Get, the Smaller We Act
With every passing year, this mantra continues to drive and challenge our strategy. As we continue to grow, it's more important than ever that we cherish our roots, continue the ethos that led to the creation of Shake Shack and to never veer from our original vision. We grew our Shack community by creating nearly 2,000 jobs across the country, adding 49 new Shacks, reaching more than 200 Shacks worldwide. Through this growth, we continue to make decisions that focus on the core of who we are, staying true to our mission to Stand For Something Good and the principles of Enlightened Hospitality. These principles drive us to seek out the finest team members, the tastiest ingredients, the best suppliers and the best community partners.
Hospitality in the Digital Age
Shake Shack continues to pursue innovation in technology that seeks to create an active dialogue with our guests, drive higher engagement and raise the bar on operational excellence and overall guest experience. Guests can now get their Shack wherever and whenever they want, including: (i) via mobile-ordering app; (ii) kiosk-ordering at select Shacks; (iii) web-ordering directly from their device; (iv) delivered to their door; and of course, (v) at their nearest Shack!
An essential part of Shake Shack's digital strategy is the Shack App.The launch of our first-ever mobile ordering app-available on both IOS and Android nationwide was a huge milestone for us in 2017. With the Shack App, we’re able to meet our guests wherever they are and provide them a whole new way to experience Shake Shack. The Shack App was developed to elevate the in-Shack experience, aiming to provide shorter pick-up times and convenient mobile ordering. Guests can order Shake Shack when they want it right from their phone, and it will be cooked-to-order and timed to their arrival. The Shack App features all our menu classics—all-natural beef burgers, flat-top dogs, chicken sandwiches, frozen custard, crinkle cut fries and more—and includes all the mobile ordering essentials: guests can pick from their favorite orders; keep track of food allergies; access nutritional information; see the latest events and promos; connect to all Shake Shack social media channels and share feedback. 
Shack App Redesign
In 2018, knowing that consumers demand faster, easier and more personalized experiences, we used guest data to develop a number of enhancements that optimize the path to purchase with our Shack App redesign. These enhancements included: (i) creating efficiencies in the checkout process; (ii) optimizing the path to purchase, anticipating guests needs and help guests through checkout; (iii) providing a way to mark orders as favorites; (iv) more personalization with the ability to strategically message based on where the guest is in the order life cycle; and (v) preparing for enhanced location services like geo-tracking, allowing us to more seamlessly time guests orders for pickup and deliver a better product.

Web Ordering
This year we piloted our web ordering platform, starting at 10 Shacks across the country, then rolling out nationwide by the end of the year. This new ordering channel is similar in feel to our kiosks and mobile application, and guests follow the same pick up process as the Shack App. With higher category limits (versus the Shack App) and the ability to check out as a guest, web ordering offers yet another convenient ordering opportunity to our guests.
Kiosk Ordering
We introduced our first kiosk-only ordering, cashless environment at our Astor Place Shack in New York City in 2017, and as of December 26, 2018, we had 16 Shacks using a form of kiosk across the country. The Shack kiosk was developed with an enhanced guest experience in mind, allowing us to serve more guests at peak times—whether in-Shack, for pickup via the Shack App or even delivery—intending to result in fewer lines, less wait time and less friction at every channel. The Shack kiosk replicates the experience of the Shack App with a sharp aesthetic, an intuitive touch screen interface and ease of ordering. Guests simply select their food, place an order and choose to receive an alert via text or buzzer when their order is ready. Hospitality Champs are stationed around the kiosks to assist guests with their orders and answer any questions.
Delivery 
We continued to explore delivery as a way to bring Shake Shack to our guests wherever they are and whenever they want. As an essential part of how consumers eat today, delivery presents a unique opportunity to reach even more people and allow them to engage with Shake Shack on their terms. We conducted various delivery pilots with several partners throughout the year and also offered special delivery promotions. 
We also continue to create and test new packaging, especially with our entrance into delivery, which will help provide the best possible Shack experience to our guests at home. We learned about our various Shacks' ability to handle delivery at peak times and gained perspective on the capabilities of delivery partners and the benefits of systems integration. We expect that our thoughtful, strategic approach to delivery will result in an overall better Shake Shack experience for our guests.
We Are a Team: We Take Care of Each Other
Our people make all the difference and we remain committed to investing in our people to build the best team and retain our talent. We believe the culture and unity that we have built amongst our Shack teams and across the Company as a whole is a key driver of our ability to deliver a great guest experience and, therefore, continue to successfully grow our footprint. We seek to be an employer of choice by offering competitive wages, comprehensive benefits and a variety of incentive programs. We believe that team members who are treated and trained well will deliver Enlightened Hospitality and a superior guest experience. Through our leadership development programs, we teach our team members the principles of Enlightened Hospitality and how to live and breathe our Shack Pact, the agreement that encompasses our value system and brand ethos. Ultimately, we believe that when we have the best team, we can reach our goals, deliver a great guest experience and continue to build our brand. 
The HUG Fund Mission
One way we embrace Enlightened Hospitality internally is through the administration of our own HUG (Help Us Give) Fund program that we rolled out to our employees in late fiscal 2017. The HUG Fund provides a wonderful way for Shake Shack team members company-wide to take care of each other through tax-deductible payroll and other one-time contributions. The sole purpose of the HUG Fund is to provide timely financial assistance to our employees impacted by financially devastating circumstances that are far beyond their control and their means. All of the money donated by Shake Shack employees at every level will go directly into the fund. 
Leaders Training Future Leaders
We invest in our team through extensive leadership development programs to so that Shake Shack remains a great place to work and a compelling career choice for team members at every level. We have built a culture of active learning and we foster an environment of leadership development throughout the entire life cycle of employment. We believe that our culture of Enlightened Hospitality enables us to develop future leaders from within, and deliver a consistent Shack experience as our team continues to grow.
The Shacksperience and Steppin' Up Model
Shake Shack Inc.  Form 10-K | 5

The goal of our training programs is to develop leaders and to cross-utilize team members throughout our operations. We call our team member life cycle and overall employment experience, The Shacksperience™. The Steppin' Up Model is the growth model for Shake Shack employees which defines the steps in the employment life cycle, beginning with the team member position and working up through the general manager position. It clarifies the eligibility requirements and training necessary for each position, outlines the growth opportunities at all levels of the organization and furthers our philosophy of "leaders training future leaders." By creating this model, employees have a clear view of the career progression for a Shack employee, which in turn helps foster communication in achieving these goals. We train our culture and guiding principles first, then move to menu knowledge, followed by a focus on operational training. We believe that everyone learns differently and our training programs use various formats: online interactive, video, hands-on and paper-based. For those online interactive training sessions, every team member has access to ShackSource™, our proprietary online training portal, which is used not only as a learning platform, but also as a communication tool for our team. ShackSource also allows team members to send recognition messages, comments, praise and thanks to their fellow team members across the Company. And for those hands-on training sessions, our new Leadership Center is the perfect place to host. Located below our Home Office on the lower level of our West Village Shack, the Leadership Center is a space dedicated to the training and development of our Shack teams and Home Office, where we now host a number of our New Leader Orientation for new managers.
We care about our team and are committed to setting them up for success in the future, both at Shake Shack and in their future careers. In 2018 we promoted 1,151 people throughout our company. Our shift manager position, a level between a team member and manager, allows team members to be introduced to certain managerial-level skills before making the full transition to manager. We are incredibly proud of the number of leaders who continue to graduate from hourly roles to shift managers, and on up the ladder of Shack leadership. We are committed to retaining our leaders and will continue to evolve training, compensation and benefits to do so, such as extending our equity program to general managers.
We Are Fine Casual: Inspired Food and Drink
We embrace our fine-dining heritage and are committed to sourcing premium, sustainable ingredients, such as all-natural, hormone and antibiotic-free beef, chicken and pork, while offering excellent value to our guests. Our core menu remains focused, and is supplemented with targeted innovation inspired by the best versions of the classic American roadside burger stand. Always focused on culinary creativity and excellence, we collaborate with award-winning chefs, talented bakers, farmers and artisanal purveyors who work with us in different and engaging ways. We never stop looking for the best ingredients and the best culinary partners in order to exceed our guests' expectations in every aspect of their experience. As we grow across the country, we are excited to collaborate even more with the talented chefs and suppliers who are leading our industry. 
Our signature items are our all-natural, hormone and antibiotic-free burgers, hot dogs, crispy chicken, crinkle cut fries, shakes and frozen custard. We cook our burgers to order, hand-spin our shakes and strive to use the freshest premium ingredients available. 
Our Menu
Our menu focuses on premium food and beverages, carefully crafted from a range of classic American foods at more accessible price points than full-service restaurants. The Shake Shack concept continues to offer our classic core menu items, introduced in 2004, which speaks to the timeless and universal appeal of our food offerings, and supplements this core menu with various other limited time and exclusive offerings.

 | Burgers & Chicken
Our burgers are made with a proprietary whole-muscle blend of 100% all-natural, hormone and antibiotic-free Angus beef, ground fresh daily, cooked to order and served on a non-GMO potato bun. We take great care in the preparation of our burgers—from sourcing, to handling, to cooking—to strive that the taste and quality of the burgers we serve is second to none. Our signature burger is the ShackBurger®, which is a four-ounce cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce™. Our burger offerings also include the SmokeShack®, 'Shroom Burger™ (our vegetarian burger), Shack Stack® and Hamburger. Our Chick’n Shack™ is a 100% all-natural, hormone and antibiotic-free cage-free chicken breast, slow cooked in buttermilk herbs, hand-battered, hand-breaded and crisp-fried to order.

 | Crinkle Cut Fries 
Our classic and passionately loved crinkle cut fries are made from premium Yukon potatoes and are prepared 100% free of artificial trans-fat. Guests can also enjoy our Cheese Fries, which are our crinkle cut fries topped with a proprietary blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce. We believe the tactile pleasure and emotional attachment that our guests have to the crispiness and ridges of our crinkle cut fries is a nostalgic ode to the roadside burger stand of yesteryear. 
 | Hot Dogs 
Shake Shack was born from a hot dog cart in 2001 and we believe that our hot dog category gives our guests another premium category from which to choose. Both our beef hot dogs and our chicken dogs are made from 100% all-natural, hormone and antibiotic-free beef and chicken. Our signature Shack-cago Dog® is our nod to the classic Chicago-style hot dog, topped with Shack relish, onion, cucumber, pickle, tomato, sport pepper, celery salt and mustard. 
 | Frozen Custard 
Our premium, dense, rich and creamy ice cream, hand-spun daily on-site, is crafted from our proprietary vanilla and chocolate recipes using only real sugar (no corn syrup) and milk from dairy farmers who pledge not to use artificial growth hormones. Shakes remain our guests' favorite in this category and are scooped and spun to order. Our concretes are made by blending frozen custard at high speed with premium mix-ins. Since each Shake Shack intends to engage its community, each Shack has signature concretes, distinct to its location, that use locally-sourced mix-ins made by artisanal producers whenever possible. 
 | Beer, Wine and Beverages
Our proprietary ShackMeister® Ale, brewed by Brooklyn Brewery, was specifically crafted to complement the flavor profile of a ShackBurger. At select locations, we also offer local craft beers tailored to each Shack's geography. When it comes to wine, our organic and biodynamic Shack Red® and Shack White® is sourced and produced exclusively by Gotham Project, which accentuates our fine dining ethos and provides our guests with premium beverage options not commonly found in our industry. In addition, we serve Abita Root Beer, Shack-made Lemonade, organic fresh brewed iced tea, Fifty/Fifty™ (half lemonade, half organic iced tea), Stumptown cold brew coffee, Honest Kids organic apple juice and Shack|20® bottled water, from which 1% of the sales supports the clean-up of water sources around the world.
 | Dogs Are Welcome Too 
We know that many dog owners treat their four-legged friends as family members. From our first Shack in Madison Square Park, we wanted to include dogs as part of the community gathering experience and developed the "Woof" section on our menu. ShackBurger dog biscuits, peanut butter sauce and vanilla custard make up our signature Pooch-ini®, which is available at Shacks with an outdoor space. We also serve dog biscuits to-go, handcrafted exclusively for us by a New York-based bakery. 

Culinary Innovation
We continuously innovate around our core menu and our team is constantly experimenting with seasonal and local products, to enhance our menu, drive revenue and give our guests more reasons to keep coming back to Shake Shack. 
The Innovation Kitchen
As a way to further foster innovation, we opened our first Innovation Kitchen in September 2018. Located on the lower level of the West Village Shack, and connected to our Home Office, the state-of-the-art Innovation Kitchen is the hub of all menu development at Shake Shack. This new dedicated space allows our culinary team to get even more creative, dig deeper into our fine dining roots, collaborate with other chefs and explore new opportunities as we continue to scale, with guest favorites potentially becoming permanent menu items. It also allows us to house our quality assurance and culinary teams together for the first time. The West Village Shack’s menu will have all the classic items, but still remain unique to all others, featuring a rotating list of items from the Innovation Kitchen.
Shack-Wide Limited Time Offerings ("LTO")
Shake Shack Inc.  Form 10-K | 7

We continued our LTO program through fiscal 2018 where we featured a new premium burger or chicken menu item for varying time periods throughout the year. We will continue to supplement our core menu with targeted innovation inspired by the best versions of the classic American roadside burger stands.

▪ | Griddled Chick'n— In January 2018 we rolled out our Griddled Chick'n—our all-natural chicken breast topped with Niman Ranch smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato and buttermilk herb mayo. The Griddled Chick'n premiered exclusively on the Shack App before being offered nationwide. 


▪ | Smoked Cheddar BBQ Lineup — In April 2018 we launched a limited-edition lineup of Smoked Cheddar BBQ items nationwide. The Smoked Cheddar BBQ Bacon Burger is a 100% all-natural Angus beef cheeseburger with smoked cheddar cheese, Niman Ranch smoked bacon, pickles and Shack BBQ sauce; the Smoked Cheddar BBQ Bacon Griddled Chick'n is griddled all-natural chicken breast with smoked cheddar cheese, Niman Ranch smoked bacon, pickles and Shack BBQ sauce; and the Smoked Cheddar BBQ Bacon Cheese Fries are crinkle-cut fries topped with all-natural smoked Niman Ranch bacon, Shack BBQ Sauce and cheese sauce.


▪ | Hot Chick'n — In September 2018 we brought back a spicy favorite, our Hot Chick'n. In fiscal 2017 we launched Hot Chick'n as a limited-time menu item, and by popular demand, brought it back and made it customizable—with "hot" or "even hotter" optional. Our Hot Chick'n is crafted from an all-natural chicken breast—no hormones or antibiotics—slow-cooked in a creamy buttermilk marinade, hand-dipped into Shack-made batter, dredged through seasoned flour and crisp-fried. The sandwich is dusted with a guajillo and cayenne pepper blend and topped with Louisiana hot sauce slaw, kosher dill pickles and served on the same non-GMO potato bun as the classic ShackBurger. 


▪ | Trio of Featured Shakes — Throughout 2018 we offered our guests a new slate of premium shake offerings for extended periods of time. For approximately three months each, we offered a trio of new featured shakes, which included: Chocolate Chip Red Velvet, Mint Cookies & Cream and Apple Pie à la Mode and White Mocha, Christmas Cookie; Marshmallow Chocolate Chip, Chocolate Brownie and Mocha Cookies & Cream; and Chocolate Peppermint. In 2019, we will be featuring a new shake each month, kicking January off with the Tiramisu shake and the Salted Vanilla Toffee shake in February. 

Exclusive Offerings
In addition to supplementing our menu with LTOs, we also seek to create new and exciting offerings that are inspired by local favorites or special events. Some examples of our exclusive offerings from fiscal 2018 include:

▪ | Veggie Shack — In April 2018 we launched our first veggie burger at select Shacks, and by the end of the year it was available at 18 Shacks. The Veggie Shack is made with black beans, brown rice and roasted beets topped with provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles and vegan mustard mayo. It can also be made entirely vegan by removing the cheese and substituting a gluten free bun or lettuce wrap. 


▪ | BBQ Pulled Pork — In July 2018 we offered our BBQ Pulled Pork Burger on the app at select New York City and New Jersey Shacks. The BBQ Pulled Pork Burger is a cheeseburger topped with Niman Ranch BBQ pulled pork, jalapeño slaw and pickles. 


▪ | Chick'n Bites — In September 2018, we launched Chick'n Bites exclusively at our West Village Shack. Chick'n Bites are crispy pieces of hand-breaded chicken breast, served with BBQ or honey mustard sauces, and available in a six-piece or 10-piece order size. In later September and October, Chick'n Bites were rolled out at select New York City Shacks and other markets across the country.


• | Montlake Double Cut — In October 2018, we introduced our Seattle-exclusive burger, the Montlake Double Cut, which features a Washington State all-natural beef double cheeseburger with Beecher’s ‘Just Jack’ cheese, caramelized onions and grainy mustard mayo on a Macrina Bakery bun. It was important to us to introduce something truly local to this proud food town and continue to show our culinary heritage and differentiation. This exclusive burger is available daily in limited quantities. 


• | Golden Gate Double Shack —In December 2018, we introduced the Golden Gate Double Shack at our Palo Alto opening, which featured two grass-fed beef patties from Northern California’s Richards Grassfed Beef. In addition to the burger,

we offered three local concretes, including: the MB Malt, with vanilla custard, Manresa Bread whole wheat chocolate chip walnut cookies and fudge; the Shack Attack, with chocolate custard, fudge sauce, chocolate truffle cookie dough, Dandelion dark chocolate chunks, and chocolate sprinkles; and the Pie Oh My, with vanilla custard and a slice of seasonal pie from Fremont bakery Pie Dreams.
Chef Collaborations
Our fine dining heritage has enabled Shake Shack to team up with some of the world's best chefs for short-term special menu items. We devote significant resources to menu innovation and are frequently invited to participate and compete in chef events such as the South Beach Wine and Food Festival's Burger Bash, which allows us to test out new creations that can often lead to the introduction of new items. Some of our more notable collaborations in fiscal 2018 include:

▪ | Breakfast Taco and Chick'n de Sanchez — In February 2018 we partnered with Rosio Sanchez, chef and founder of Copenhagen’s Sanchez and Hija de Sanchez, to bring New York City a two-part, one-day-only collaboration. At the Madison Square Park Shack, we served the brand-new, limited-edition Breakfast Taco and Chick’n de Sanchez. The Breakfast Taco featured roast pork belly, cured egg yolk, avocado and habanero salsa in a fresh-made corn tortilla, and the Chick’n de Sanchez featured a crispy chicken breast with spicy arbol oil, guajillo chili mayo, avocado, pickled onions, Boston lettuce and crema.


▪ | Shack Cheesesteak — In April 2018 we teamed up with our longtime partner, famed butcher Pat LaFrieda, to bring New York City a one-day-only, limited edition Shack Cheesesteak. The Shack Cheesesteak featured Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors shaved steak, Shack Cheddar and American cheese sauce, caramelized onions and chopped cherry peppers on a hero roll. Additionally, $1 from every Shack Cheesesteak purchased benefited the Bob Woodruff Foundation, an organization that invests to find, fund and shape programs that works to empower impacted veterans, service members and their families.


▪ | Lilia Burger — To welcome our new Williamsburg Shack to Brooklyn in June 2018, we collaborated with chef Missy Robins, of the local Italian restaurant Lilia, to create the Lilia Burger— a double hamburger brushed with garlic herb butter and topped with parmigiana fonduta—offered specifically for opening day at the Shack. Additionally for the Williamsburg opening day, we premiered the Shack's exclusive concretes, created through collaborations with local vendors, including the "Just Du It", "Shack Attack" and "Pie Oh-My" concretes which features mix-ins from Du's Donuts, Mast Brother Chocolate and Four & Twenty Blackbirds, all of which are permanent menu items exclusive to the Williamsburg Shack.


▪ | Ludo Shack and Salted Caramel Wakame Shake — For one day only in October at the Madison Square Park Shack, we collaborated with chef Ludo Lefebvre to serve the Ludo Shack and Salted Caramel Wakame Shake. The Ludo Shack is a double cheeseburger topped with bordelaise and special sauce, our interpretation of Ludo’s famous Big Mec burger. The Salted Caramel Wakame Shake is our classic salted caramel shake with a twist: Wakame edible seaweed!

We Are A Warm Community Gathering Place 
Design Philosophy
The experience of Shake Shack continues to drive our strategy. Throughout fiscal 2018, and looking forward, we continued to enhance our design capability, simultaneously designing some of our most dynamic Shacks while gaining efficiency in the design process to prepare for the scalability of development ahead. The design of our Shacks is critical to the Shake Shack experience and we blend our core brand identifiers with features specifically designed for each Shack to be of its place and connect directly with its neighborhood. Whether domestic or international, we are passionate about securing vibrant sites and creating unique designs that give each Shack a hand-crafted look, are locally focused, and are appropriate for their respective communities. A typical domestic company-operated Shack is generally between 3,000 and 4,000 square feet with interior seating for between 75 and 100 guests. Additionally, whenever possible, our domestic company-operated Shacks feature either outdoor seating or easy access to a park or green space. We use high-quality tactile materials, warm lighting that focuses on every table and highlights the textured walls and seating layouts that encourage guests to relax and stay for a while. We take great care to build each Shack with thoughtful design with distinctive architectural features —all while taking key inspiration from our first home in Madison Square Park. The original Shake Shack in Madison Square Park was designed by SITE Architecture and Design, led by James Wines and Denise Lee, in collaboration with Pentagram, led by Paula Scher. This design set the tone for a dynamic dialogue inside the park and our 
Shake Shack Inc.  Form 10-K | 9

surrounding neighborhood that continues to drive our designs today. The overall atmosphere of our new Shacks aim to evoke the very best from the original park kiosk, as well as the best of the fine dining experience in terms of the quality of design, materials used, lighting and music. We are mindful that each new Shack should embody the experience of the Madison Square Park Shake Shack—the line, the kiosk style, the experience of ordering food made just for you and the energetic open kitchen. 
Each Shack is specifically designed to be of its place and connect with its neighborhood, but we have developed a number of iconic brand identifiers, including wrap-around steel beams, open kitchens, large distinctive menu boards and tables made from reclaimed bowling lanes from New York. We believe that these brand identifiers are key components to the expression of the brand and the experience of Shake Shack. 
Often during the construction of new Shacks, particularly those in new markets, we re-imagine the often uninspiring plywood barriers that surround a construction site and use this as a canvas to begin the process of introducing Shake Shack to the community prior to our opening. We also collaborate with local artists and designers to bring beautiful artwork designs and installation to our Shacks from time to time. At our first Seattle Shack, we featured hoarding covered in classic Shake Shack menu icons outlined in moss. In preparation for our first Hong Kong Shack that opened in 2018, we partnered with local illustrator and artist Zoie Lam to create hoarding that combined local culture with American graffiti art. 
Today, we continue to evolve our timeless designs through the engagement of different designers from around the country.  We continue to develop our prototypes, “classic” Shack designs, free-standing, in-line and unique formats.  We are constantly pushing to be more creative and nimble, allowing us to ramp up our growth while making the Shack experience even more dynamic and accessible, as well as adapting to smaller footprints, proving our versatility and ability to enter and flourish in a variety of spaces. We currently use our second generation prototype model: a 3,200 square foot free-standing Shack that fits well in suburban locations, designed with more efficient use of materials while still offering the same full guest experience. Additionally, we further innovated our Shack design in the digital space by introducing a whole new guest flow with the opening of our first kiosk-only ordering and cashless environment at Astor Place last year and we have continued to design new Shacks incorporating the kiosk into their layout. We designed an optimized kitchen, with a self-service beverage station, bringing it out of the kitchen, as well as a split-kitchen format that aim to allow for greater output during peak times. We also continue to evolve and innovate around the growing digital order capabilities, experimenting with new pickup shelving and guest flow. 
In April 2018, we moved our Home Office headquarters to the West Village of New York City. Our new Home Office features expanded space for our Home Office employees, our West Village Shack on the ground floor, a test kitchen facility on the lower level where our culinary team can continue to dream up new menu items, and a multi-purpose room to host special events and training. We engaged the team at Michael Hsu Office of Architecture in designing the new Home Office, who we have also worked with in bringing us designs at our Shacks, for example, in West Hollywood and South Lamar. The Home Office was created with the mission to reflect and foster our culture and brand history. It was designed to be inherently flexible and foster collaborative work, with open spaces for our Home Office team and Shack teams to come together. The West Village Shack reflects the neighborhood with detailed greenery and an art installation by a local artist. The Shack is crafted from recycled or sustainable materials - table tops are made from reclaimed bowling alley lanes and booths are created using certified Forest Stewardship Council lumber. Our new Home Office is an important investment in our team, our continued growth and our ability to continue to innovate.
Beloved Lifestyle Brand
Since 2004, we have become a globally recognized brand with outsized consumer awareness relative to our current footprint of 208 Shacks, opening our first international Shack after only seven domestic Shacks. Shake Shack has become a New York City institution, a vibrant and authentic community gathering place that delivers an unparalleled experience to our loyal guests and a broad, global demographic. Shake Shack grew up alongside the emergence of social media and we believe we have benefited from an ongoing love affair with passionate fans who want to engage with us and share their real-time experiences with friends. We aim to establish genuine connections with our guests and the communities in which they live. Shake Shack continues to be recognized by media and influencers alike, garnering attention around the world.
Our positioning and brand voice, derived from the spirit, integrity and light-hearted nature of Shake Shack, are reinforced by our contemporary, responsible designs and hospitable team members who Stand For Something Good; this identity anchors our marketing efforts. We believe that our guests recognize Shake Shack as a community gathering place and, thus, the heart of our marketing strategy is to cultivate that community and connect with our guests both in our Shacks and through digital channels.

Digital and Social Media
Much like how we design our Shacks to be community gathering places, we execute a digital media strategy that creates an online, on-brand community gathering place. With our social media, we mirror the in-person hospitality that a guest experiences when they visit the Shack. We interact with fans on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter through comments, replies and the use of user-generated content; a quick search of "#shakeshack" on Instagram as of December 26, 2018 reveals about 927,000 organic posts from our fans! In addition to social media, we also send out menu item alerts, local event invites, new Shack opening information and other relevant Shake Shack news through our email marketing program. We're focused on strengthening our ties to the community by engaging with new and excited fans and building brand awareness through our digital marketing channels.
The Shack App provides a different way to experience Shake Shack and promote our signature menu items as well as our creative promotions. Our app redesign this year worked to improve that experience even more with our enhancements that optimized the path to purchase. In addition to our social media presence, the Shack App is another digital tool that allows us to further expand our brand awareness by providing a new way to connect with our guests. Guests have the opportunity to take advantage of certain promotions and vouchers featured on the Shack App. We had our first digital partnership promotion this year with Bumble, where Bumble ran a campaign featured in their app to buy one, get one burger card that guests in the Shake Shack markets could match with a Bumble user. Also, for Election Day, guests had the opportunity to order through the app with the code "ivoted" to receive an order of free fries. On our shakeshack.com website we have a mobile-friendly interactive digital tool featuring allergen and nutritional data, dedicated Shack App page and a Shack city guide section with local geo-mapping. 
Community and Charitable Partners
Each Shack focuses on conveying a consistent national brand message while also tailoring marketing efforts to each region. We have menu items that feature local ingredients and beers that are specific to each Shack's community. We also aim marketing efforts at local events by participating in local celebrations and developing relationships within the community, which helps position Shake Shack as a premium brand that is connected to its neighborhood through. Outside of local events, each Shack has a local charity partner to which it donates 5% of the sales from its Pie Oh My concrete. The D.C. Shacks, for instance, featured the "Livin' the Pie Life" and donates 5% of this Pie Oh My concrete's sales to Casey's Trees. We also serve our communities by hosting 25% Donation Days—we designate a Monday or Tuesday for our partners to promote and bring out their friends and family to have 25% of participant’s order values donated back to the charity of choice. 
Since 2012, Shake Shack annually has held The Great American Shake Sale™ during the month of May to raise money and awareness for childhood hunger. During The Great American Shake Sale, we encourage guests to donate $2 in exchange for a free shake (a $5 value) at their next visit. 100% of these donations go directly to Share Our Strength's No Kid Hungry campaign. In May 2018, we raised $343,000 across our domestic company-operated Shacks for this initiative.
In 2018, between the 25% donation days, product donations, special charitable promotions, concrete contributions and the Great American Shake Sale, we raised over $750,000 for charities!
In addition to each Shack's local charity partner, Shacks will also participate or host other local charitable events. Some examples include:

▪ | LOVE SHACK SHAKE with the B52s – For Valentine's Day, we teamed up with the famed music group The B-52s, to create the Love Shack Shake–a strawberry blonde milkshake topped with whipped cream and glitter sprinkles–offered for a limited time in February. Additionally, for every Love Shack sold, Shake Shack donated $2 to Canine Companions for Independence, a non-profit that enhances the lives of people with disabilities by providing highly trained assistance dogs and a lifetime of support entirely free of charge.


▪ | Team Mr8 Shack— In April 2018 the Newbury Street Shack kicked off marathon Monday in Boston with its exclusive Team Mr8 Shake – vanilla custard blended with fudge and peanut butter sauces, topped with whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles. All proceeds from the shake went to Team Mr8, the Martin Richard Foundation, which provides opportunities for young people to learn, grow and lead through volunteerism and community engagement.


▪ | PRIDE — Throughout the month of June, we participated in Pride activations throughout the country, including the Pride parades in New York City, Washington D.C., Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego and Lexington. Our teams were decked

Shake Shack Inc.  Form 10-K | 11

out in Pride swag and distributed to parade-goers, hosted silent dance parties and vended at events. On our website, we sold a limited-edition Pride capsule collection, including a Shake Shack X PINTRILL pin, tee, tote and beach towel, of which 100% of the proceeds benefited The Trevor Project. We also sold a Pride Shake–a strawberry shake blended with Shack-made lemonade, topped with whipped cream and rainbow sprinkles–from which $1 of every shake sold also benefited the charity.
Pop-ups, Promotions and Events
Throughout fiscal 2018 we continued to do innovative branding by collaborating with other chefs and creating various pop-up concepts, as well as offering exciting promotions and participating in special events to drive brand awareness. These pop-ups are a key part of building the growing strength of the Shake Shack brand while capturing these unique moments that differentiate our brand. Some notable collaborative pop-ups, promotions and events include:

▪ | Coachella and Stagecoach Music and Arts Festival – In April 2018 we were excited to serve up our classic menu items at the Coachella Music and Arts Festival and Stagecoach Festival for three three-day weekends in California, where we set-up our first-ever festival kiosk model.


▪ | Allbirds Collaboration – For one day only in May at the Madison Square Park Shack, we set up shop with Allbirds and offered one-of-a-kind Shake Shack Tree Runners, a custom limited-edition lace kit and a Hokey Pokey shake – inspired by Allbirds’ New Zealand roots, which featured honeycomb candy and chocolate, topped with whipped cream and toffee. 


▪ | Shake Shack X Canlis Backlot Pop-Up – To celebrate Seattle's first taste of Shake Shack, in June 2018, we partnered with Canlis, a Westlake fine dining institution, to serve-up Shake Shack classics plus Canlis Dungeness Crab melts, and créme brülée Whoopie pies, as well as featuring live music, all taking place in the backlot of Canlis.


▪ | Shake Shack X Bob's Burgers Pop-Up – In preparation for the kick-off of Comic-Con, and in celebration of the 150th episode of Fox's sitcom Bobs Burgers, we decorated our Mission Valley Shack in San Diego with Bob's Burgers artwork, including a replica of the show's iconic dining counter. We offered a "Burger of the Day" just as Bob would, called "Can I have your Slaw-tograph Burger"– a cheeseburger topped with barbecue pulled pork, jalapeño, pickles and scallion slaw.


▪ | Shake Shack X Ralph's Italian Ices Pop-Up – In anticipation of Shake Shack's opening at the Staten Island Mall, we popped up at the original Ralph's Famous Italian Ices & Ice Cream. We served-up a limited menu featuring ShackBurgers and crinkle-cut fries alongside Ralph's full menu, along with a one-day only collaboration, the Strawberry SHACKcake Italian Ice. 

Media, Product Placement and Influencers 
Shake Shack’s unique positioning has allowed us to garner robust media coverage across food, lifestyle, business and trade publications. We are often featured in outlets such as Bon Appetit, Food & Wine, Eater, Grub Street, Refinery29, BuzzFeed, People, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Business Insider, CNBC, Fast Company, Forbes, Digiday and more. Shake Shack is continually mentioned on morning shows like TODAY Show, Good Morning America, CBS Sunday Morning and LIVE with Kelly and Ryan, as well as late shows like Saturday Night Live, The Late Show with James Corden, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Daily Show, Late Night with Seth Meyers and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. We have also been mentioned in prime time television programs like CBS’s sitcom The Big Bang Theory and ABC's Jeopardy. 
Shake Shack has been fortunate to receive considerable product placement in movies, TV shows and other media without any cost to the Company, and in some cases, has been able to charge fees for these location shoots, which have included scenes from the motion pictures Something Borrowed and Tower Heist, as well as the acclaimed HBO series The Newsroom, Showtime's Billions and Shameless and the Amazon original series Bosch (which featured our West Hollywood Shack).
Shake Shack’s popularity and cultural relevance has awarded us countless celebrity and influencer fans across Hollywood, music, fashion, sports and more. We have seen organic promotion from the likes of Matt Damon, Oprah, Keith Urban and Taylor Swift, to name a few.
We Are Accountable For Results 
12 | Shake Shack Inc.  Form 10-K

Our brand power and thoughtful approach to growth have resulted in strong performance across a variety of geographies and formats. We grew from 63 Shacks in fiscal 2014 to 208 Shacks in fiscal 2018 spanning 26 states (and the District of Columbia) and 13 countries, representing a 35% compound annual growth rate ("CAGR"). As a result of our expansion and strong performance:

▪ | Our total revenue grew from $118.5 million in fiscal 2014 to $459.3 million in fiscal 2018, a 40% CAGR. Compared to fiscal 2017, total revenue increased 28.0% in fiscal 2018.


▪ | Net income attributable to Shake Shack Inc. for fiscal 2018 was $15.2 million, compared to a loss of $0.3 million for fiscal 2017.


▪ | Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 14% to $73.9 million for fiscal 2018 from $64.7 million for fiscal 2017. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures—EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA" in Part II, Item 7.


▪ | Adjusted pro forma net income, a non-GAAP measure, increased 28.0% to $26.9 million, or $0.71 per fully exchanged and diluted share in fiscal 2018, compared to $21.0 million, or $0.57 per fully exchanged and diluted share in fiscal 2017. For a reconciliation of adjusted pro forma, a non-GAAP measure, to net income (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc., see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share" in Part II, Item 7. 


(1) | System-wide sales consists of sales from our domestic company-operated Shacks, our domestic licensed Shacks and our international licensed Shacks. We do not recognize the sales from our licensed Shacks as revenue. Of these amounts, our revenue is limited to Shack sales from domestic company-operated Shacks and licensing revenue based on a percentage of sales from domestic and international licensed Shacks. Our total revenue also includes certain up-front fees such as territory fees and opening fees we receive in connection with our licensing arrangements.

COMPETITION
The restaurant industry is highly competitive and fragmented, with restaurants competing on multiple areas, such as taste, price, food quality, service, location and the ambiance and condition of the restaurant. Our primary competitors include other fast casual restaurants, quick service restaurants and casual dining restaurants. Our competition includes multi-unit national and regional chains, as well as a wide variety of locally-owned restaurants. Our competitors may operate company-owned restaurants, franchised restaurants or some combination. Many of our competitors offer breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as dine-in, carry-out and delivery services. We may also compete with companies outside of the traditional restaurant industry, such as grocery store chains, meal subscription services and delicatessens, especially those that target customers who seek high-quality food, as well as convenience food stores, cafeterias and other dining outlets. Our competition continues to intensify as new competitors enter both the burger 
Shake Shack Inc.  Form 10-K | 13

and fast casual segments, as well as new digital experience and convenience food options. We also face increasing competitive pressures from some of our competitors who have recently announced initiatives to offer better quality ingredients, such as antibiotic-free meat. For more information regarding the risks we face from our competitors, who may have, among other things, a more diverse menu, greater financial resources, lower operating costs, a more well-established brand, better locations and more effective marketing than we do, see "Risks Related to Operating in the Restaurant Industry—We face significant competition for guests, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business could be adversely affected" in Item 1A, Risk Factors.
We specifically target guests that seek an engaging and differentiated guest experience that includes great food, unique and thoughtful integration with local communities and high standards of excellence and hospitality. We believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our market position, as we believe consumers will continue to trade up to higher quality offerings given the increasing consumer focus on responsible sourcing, ingredients and preparation. Additionally, we believe that consumers will continue to move away from the added time commitment and cost of traditional casual dining. We believe that many consumers want to associate with brands whose ethos matches their own, and that Shake Shack, with our mission to Stand For Something Good and our culture of Enlightened Hospitality, is a distinct and differentiated global lifestyle brand.
GROWTH STRATEGIES
We believe that we are well-positioned to achieve significant, sustainable financial growth. Our goal — to be a growing and loyal brand, connected to our community, relentlessly focused on excellence, experience and hospitality. We plan to continue to expand our business, drive Shack sales and enhance our competitive positioning by executing on the following strategies:
Opening New Domestic Company-Operated Shacks
This is where our greatest opportunity for growth lies. Shake Shack’s business model remains strong and we intend to open many more Shacks. We waited nearly five years to open our second Shack, and we are still in the very early stage of our story, with only 124 domestic company-operated and 12 domestic licensed Shacks in 26 states and Washington, D.C. as of December 26, 2018. We believe there is tremendous whitespace opportunity to expand in both existing and new U.S. markets, and we will continue to invest in the infrastructure that will enable us to continue to grow rapidly and with discipline. In fiscal 2018, we significantly expanded our domestic company-operated footprint by opening 34 new Shacks, representing a 37.8% increase in our domestic company-operated Shack count. We believe that over the long-term, we have the potential to grow our current domestic company-operated Shack footprint to at least 450 Shacks by opening domestic company-operated Shacks in new and existing markets, of which we have only opened 28% of that footprint thus far. The rate of future Shack growth in any particular period is inherently uncertain and is subject to numerous factors that are outside of our control. As a result, we do not currently have an anticipated timeframe for such expansion. We believe we have a versatile real estate model built for growth. We have adopted a disciplined expansion strategy designed to leverage the strength of our business model and our significant brand awareness to successfully develop new Shacks in an array of markets that are primed for growth, including new and existing, as well as small and large markets. We continue to be encouraged by the success of our multi-format strategy which includes Shacks in various formats including but not limited to urban centers, free-standing pads, mall locations, food courts, lifestyle centers, train stations, airports, stadiums, outlets and more. 
We will continue to expand in existing markets in 2019, in order to leverage operational effectiveness as we cluster in these high-density markets, but we will also enter new markets, including Salt Lake City and New Orleans. In 2018 we entered into five new states, including: Alabama, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and Washington. With 208 Shacks around the world (as of December 26, 2018), we have identified many attractive and differentiated markets for the Shake Shack experience. In major metropolitan areas, we seek locations where communities gather, often with characteristics such as high foot traffic, substantial commercial density, reputable co-tenants and other traffic drivers such as proximity to parks, museums, schools, hospitals and tourist attractions. For every potential domestic company-operated Shack we consider, we apply rigorous financial metrics to ensure we maintain our targeted profitability. 
Capitalizing on Our Outsized Brand Awareness
One of the great advantages for Shake Shack has been our birthplace and headquarters in New York City. Rarely has a brand of our type been born in New York, and from a fine dining company. This gives us tremendous media and brand power which often 
14 | Shake Shack Inc.  Form 10-K

outweighs our relative size. This year marked a huge accomplishment for us as we received an "A" grading from the Natural Resources Defense Council's (NRDC) Chain Reaction Report for sourcing beef raised without any antibiotics, being one of only two burger chains to have done so. Also related to how we strive to Stand For Something Good, last year we had the honor of being recognized at Compassion in World Farming’s 2017 Good Farm Animal Welfare Awards (GFAWA), which celebrates companies that use or have committed to use cage-free eggs or egg products. We focus our efforts on building a genuine connection with our guests and integrating into their communities through investment in innovative marketing and programming. Shake Shack was named in Nation's Restaurant's News as one of the 2018 Top 10 Fastest Growing Chains and on Foodable's "brand of the year" list as part of their 2018 Top Emerging Brands. Our marketing efforts focus on interacting with our guests in an authentic, innovative manner which creates memorable, meaningful experiences. The experience that we provide for our guests and local communities has generated a growing loyal following that promotes our brand through word-of-mouth. We believe that this outsized brand awareness will continue to fuel our growth in existing and new markets.
Growing Same-Shack Sales 
Given the significant awareness of our brand and the excitement we have been able to generate for our market launches, our Shacks in newer markets have generally opened with higher volumes and operating profits relative to their second year, following the strong initial honeymoon period. We expect our Shacks to deliver low single digit same-Shack sales growth over the long term, while the number of new Shack openings relative to our comparable Shack base remains our primary driver of growth in the near term. We believe, based on our business strategy and various factors in and out of our control, that we will have quarters where our same Shack sales may be negative. We do, however, continually focus on improving our same-Shack sales performance by providing an engaging and differentiated guest experience that includes new seasonal and Shack-specific offerings, technological upgrades including the Shack App, web ordering and delivery, unique and thoughtful integration with local communities and high standards of excellence and hospitality. We will continue to innovate around our core menu to keep our offerings fresh, while remaining focused on our signature items. 
Thoughtfully Increasing Our Licensed Shacks 
We will continue to grow our licensed portfolio by expanding further domestically, in the countries in which we currently have internationally licensed operations, as well as entering new international markets. This strategy historically has been a low-cost, high-return method of growing our brand awareness and providing an increasing source of cash flow. As of December 26, 2018 we had 84 licensed Shacks, of which 72 were international and 12 were domestic.
Shake Shack Inc.  Form 10-K | 15

International Licensed Operations
Throughout fiscal 2018 we continued to expand upon our international footprint by making new partnerships, as well as building upon existing ones, and opened 13 international licensed Shacks. A meaningful part of our international business strategy is focused in Asia, with continued growth in Japan and South Korea, as well as our entrance into Hong Kong this year, the first at the Central IFC Mall and the second at Pacific Place. Additionally, we entered into new licensing agreements to bring Shake Shack to the Philippines and Singapore, with the plan of opening 15 Shacks in the Philippines through 2026 and 10 Shacks in Singapore through 2023, both of which are planned to commence in 2019. We signed our first licensing agreement to enter into Japan in 2014, with a plan to open 10 Shacks over the following five years, which we were able to execute in just three years. With this great success and demand, this year we extended the agreement in Japan to open an additional 15 Shacks through 2024. As of December 26, 2018 we had a total of 19 licensed Shacks in Asia, which will increase throughout the region as we continue to execute upon our licensing agreements. Additionally, to further lead our Asian business, we announced that we will be investing in our first international regional office in Hong Kong in 2019 to support the brand and day-to-day operations. Outside of Asia, we entered into a new partnership to bring Shake Shack to Mexico, with the plan to open 30 Shacks through 2028, and the first to open in 2019. These new partnerships are great opportunities for our team to grow, learn and bring back new insights to the broader company.
Domestic Licensed Operations
Domestically, we have continued to grow our licensed business, especially in our presence at airport locations around the country, which have be an exciting layer of growth to our licensed strategy. This year we opened two domestic licensed locations, both of which were at airports, including at the Atlanta Hartsfield Airport and LaGuardia Airport. Given our position in New York and the success of our current licensed Shacks at home and abroad, we continue to attract substantial interest from potential international licensees around the world and we believe we have significant opportunities to expand our licensing footprint in existing and new international markets as our team, development opportunities and supply chain matures.

OPERATIONS
Sourcing and Supply Chain
Shake Shack has always been committed to working with best-in-class suppliers, across our supply chain. Our Stand For Something Good vision guides us in how we source and develop our ingredients, always looking for the best ways to provide top quality food at an excellent value and accessible to all. We pride ourselves on sourcing premium ingredients from like-minded ranchers, farmers and food purveyors—using real premium ingredients like 100% all-natural proteins with no hormones or antibiotics, humanely raised and source verified. We received an "A" grading from the NRDC this year in their Chain Reaction Report for sourcing beef raised without any antibiotics, being one of only two burger chains to have done so without the routine use of antibiotics. Additionally, our animal welfare policy can be found on our Shake Shack website and we have remained committed to using cage-free eggs in all of our food and have done so for the past two years. This year we elevated our mission to Stand For Something Good even further by our commitment to eliminate the use of plastic straws and high fructose corn syrup in our foods by 2019, as well as building our relationships with local suppliers and ranchers throughout the country. 
We have a regional strategy for ground beef production to ensure that we are always serving freshly ground and never frozen beef at our domestic Shacks. Initially, and around the time or our IPO, our beef production was focused in New York City. However, as we've grown around the country, we now have eight butchers spread throughout the country who produce our burgers on a daily basis, and we will continue to partner with regional suppliers in new markets as we grow.
We have a limited number of suppliers for our major ingredients, including beef patties, chicken, potato buns, custard, Portobello mushrooms and cheese sauce. In fiscal 2018, we purchased all of our (i) ground beef patties from eight suppliers, with approximately 56% of our ground beef patties from one supplier; (ii) chicken breast from one supplier; (iii) potato buns directly from one supplier; (iv) custard base from three suppliers; (v) 'Shroom Burgers from one supplier; (vi) crinkle cut fries from two suppliers; and (vii) ShackSauce from two suppliers, with approximately 88% of ShackSauce supplied by one supplier. We have developed a reliable supply chain and continue to focus on identifying alternative sources to avoid any possible interruptions of service and product.
Distribution
We contract with one distributor, which we refer to as our "broadline" distributor, to provide virtually all of our food distribution services in the United States. As of December 26, 2018, approximately 84% of our core food and beverage ingredients and 100% of our paper goods and chemicals, collectively representing approximately 49% of our purchases, were processed through our broadline distributor for distribution and delivery to each Shack. As of December 26, 2018, we were utilizing 19 affiliated distribution centers to supply our domestic company-operated Shacks. We recognize that the safety and consistency of our products begins with our suppliers. Suppliers must meet certain criteria and strict quality control standards in the production and delivery of our food and other products. We regularly evaluate our broadline distributor to ensure that the products we purchase conform to our standards and that the prices they offer are competitive.
Food Safety and Quality Assurance
Food safety is a top priority and we are committed to serving safe, high quality food. We have rigorous quality assurance and food safety protocols in place throughout our supply chain and in our Shacks. We have a comprehensive supplier and ingredient selection process and maintain a limited list of approved suppliers. We thoroughly review the results of suppliers' internal and external quality audits, insurance coverage and track record on an ongoing basis. We have a food safety site inspection process and periodically perform supplier site visits, as well as mock food recalls. We have developed and implemented training and operating standards related to the food preparation, cleanliness and safety in the Shacks. We have a dedicated Quality Assurance team to ensure food safety across all domestic company-operated Shacks as well as employing an external third-party to conduct additional audits of these Shacks on a quarterly basis. 
Site Selection
Shake Shack is ultimately about the guest experience and our site selection focuses on choosing great sites where people want to be together. Our site selection process is actively led by our Real Estate Committee, which meets regularly and follows a detailed 
Shake Shack Inc.  Form 10-K | 17

approval process to ensure quality, fiduciary responsibility and overall adherence to our strategic growth goals. We invest in analytical tools for extensive demographic analysis and data collection for both existing and new potential sites. In addition to our in-house team of experienced real estate professionals, we use a national real estate broker to manage a network of regional brokers in order to leverage external resources in pursuit of pipeline development and consistent deal flow.
Construction
A typical Shack takes between 14 and 20 weeks to build. In fiscal 2018, the total investment cost of a new Shack, which includes costs related to items such as furniture, fixtures and equipment, ranged from approximately $1.4 million to $4.0 million, with an average investment cost of approximately $2.2 million. We use a number of general contractors on a regional basis and employ a mixed approach of bidding and strategic negotiation in order to ensure the best value and highest quality construction.
Management Information Systems
Our domestic company-operated Shacks use computerized point-of-sale and back-office systems that are designed specifically for the restaurant industry and we use many customized features to increase operational effectiveness, internal communication and data analysis. This system provides a touch screen interface, graphical order confirmation display, touch screen kitchen display and integrated, high-speed credit card and gift card processing. The point-of-sale system is used to collect daily transaction data, which generates information about daily sales, product mix and average transaction size. 
Enterprise-wide System Upgrade Initiative – Project Concrete
In an effort to ensure our infrastructure and support systems are sufficiently robust and scalable to deliver upon our current and future growth opportunities, we have been making key investments in our core financial and operational systems this year through our enterprise-wide system upgrade initiative called "Project Concrete". Project Concrete is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) project to implement new systems and processes supporting our finance, procure-to-pay, inventory and human capital management (HCM) areas. Throughout Project Concrete, we will be focusing on: (i) streamlining and automating business processes within the aforementioned areas to establish a scalable foundation for robust growth; (ii) standardizing and centralizing business processes; and (iii) implementing new software applications to enable the centralized business process in a controlled and efficient way.
Our back-office computer systems are designed to assist in the management of our domestic company-operated Shacks and provide real-time labor and food cost management tools. These tools provide the Home Office and operations management quick access to detailed business data and reduces the amount of time spent by our Shack-level managers on administrative needs. Project Concrete will also replace our current back of the house systems and reduce the administrative tasks in the Shacks as we continue to invest in our tools across the company.
Digital Tools
Last year we rolled out nationwide our first-ever mobile ordering Shack App for iOS and Android, where guests are able to order Shack menu items directly from their phone. Information from the Shack App indirectly interfaces with our point-of-sale system. In 2018, we made design enhancements to our app knowing that consumers demand faster, easier and more personalized experiences, and as such, we used guest data to develop a number of these enhancements to optimize the path to purchase. These app enhancements were primarily around personalized messaging, faster and easier checkout steps, order history and activation readiness for future features.
Additionally this year, we introduced a new way our guests can get their Shack right from their computer! We piloted our web ordering platform, starting at 10 Shacks across the country, and subsequently rolling it out nationwide by the end of the year. This new ordering channel is similar in feel to our kiosks and mobile application, and guests follow the same pick up process as the app. With higher category limits (versus the Shack app) and the ability to check out as a guest, web ordering offers a way to attract the more transient guest.
We have grown our kiosk base at the Shacks throughout this year, from launching our first kiosk-only order, cashless environment at Astor Place last year to having kiosks at 16 Shacks by the end of 2018. The Shack kiosk was developed to allow Shake Shack to serve more guests at peak times – whether in-Shack, for pickup via the Shack App, or even delivery. The Shack kiosk replicates the experience of the Shack App with a sharp aesthetic, an intuitive touch screen interface and ease of ordering. Guests simply

select their food, place an order and choose to receive an alert via text when their order is ready. We incorporate the kiosk in a variety of ways at the Shack, some are kiosk-only, like at Astor Place, and others use a mixture between kiosks and cashier, whichever way, we always strive to deliver the most hospitable experience to our guests as possible.
