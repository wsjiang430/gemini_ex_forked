Item 1. Business

A. | The Company

SIFCO Industries, Inc. ("SIFCO," "Company," "we" or "our"), an Ohio corporation, was incorporated in 1916. The executive offices of the Company are located at 970 East 64th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44103, and its telephone number is (216) 881-8600.
SIFCO is engaged in the production of forgings and machined components primarily for the Aerospace and Energy ("A&E") markets. The processes and services include forging, heat-treating and machining. The Company's operations are conducted in a single business segment. Information relating to the Company's financial results is set forth in the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
On December 26, 2018, a subsidiary of the Company, located in Orange, California ("Orange") experienced a fire at its manufacturing facility, causing damage to one of three manufacturing buildings. The building that was damaged housed six of the eight presses on site. The Company is fully insured and actively working with its insurance carrier to restore the site to full service as safely and quickly as possible. Since the fire, SIFCO has taken a 2500 ton press out of storage and placed it into service in June 2019 at the Orange facility and purchased another press located in Michigan in order to continue production while the damaged presses are assessed and restored. Refurbishment of two more presses with capacities of 2500 tons and 2000 tons, are progressing and are forecasted to return to service by the end of the calendar year 2019. That leaves two remaining presses to be refurbished. SIFCO has begun the process of getting these last two presses inspected and is outlining the work requirements needed to return the presses to service. Restoration of the damaged building began in mid-June and is on schedule to be completed by the end of the calendar year 2019. Further discussion on this loss is included in Item 7 and 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

B. | Principal Products and Services

Operations
SIFCO is a manufacturer of forgings for the A&E markets. We provide our customers with envelope and precision forgings, rough, and machined components, as well as sub-assemblies. SIFCO services both original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") and aftermarket customers with products that range in size from approximately 2 to 1,200 pounds. The Company's strategic vision is to build a leading A&E company positioned for long-term, stable growth and profitability. 
SIFCO's long-term plan is to have a balance comprised of military and commercial aerospace revenues, supplemented with energy components. In fiscal 2019, commercial and military revenues accounted for 48.9% and 51.1% of revenues, respectively, compared with 52.8% in commercial revenues and 47.2% in military revenues in fiscal 2018. The Company's capabilities are focused on supplying forged and machined components, consisting primarily of steel, high temperature alloys, titanium and aluminum.
SIFCO operates from multiple locations. SIFCO manufacturing facilities are located in Cleveland, Ohio ("Cleveland"); Orange; and Maniago, Italy ("Maniago"). The Company previously maintained a location in Alliance, Ohio ("Alliance"), which closed in October 2017 (with the building at this location sold in October 2018). 
The Company's success is not dependent on patents, trademarks, licenses or franchises.
SIFCO generally has multiple sources for its raw materials, which consist primarily of high-quality metals essential to its business. Suppliers of such materials are located principally in North America and Europe. SIFCO generally does not depend on a single source for the supply of its materials. Due to the limited supply of certain raw materials, some material is provided by a small number of suppliers; however, SIFCO believes that its sources are adequate for its business. SIFCO's operations are AS 9100D and/or ISO 9001:2000 certified and the Company also holds multiple NADCAP certifications and site approvals from key OEM customers.
Products
SIFCO’s products are made primarily of steel, stainless steel, nickel alloy, titanium and aluminum. SIFCO's product offerings include: OEM and aftermarket components for aircraft and industrial gas turbine engines; steam turbine blades; structural airframe components; aircraft landing gear components; aircraft wheels and brakes; critical rotating components for helicopters; and commercial/industrial products. SIFCO also provides heat-treatment, surface-treatment, non-destructive testing and select machining and sub-assembly of forged components.

Industry
The performance of the domestic and international air transport industry and the energy industry, as well as government defense spending, directly and significantly impacts the performance of SIFCO.

• | SIFCO supplies new and spare components for commercial aircraft, principally for large aircraft produced by Boeing and Airbus. A continued increase in passenger air travel demand will drive customers' orders for new aircraft. Demand for more fuel-efficient aircraft, particularly the Boeing 777X, 787, 737 Max and the Airbus A320/A321neo and A350, remains strong with both companies reporting healthy backlogs. The current grounding of the Boeing 737Max aircraft and its recertification process has had minimal impact on SIFCO at this time. 


• | SIFCO supplies new and spare components for the U.S. military for aircraft, helicopters, vehicles, and munitions. While the defense budget in the United States varies from year to year, certain programs in which the Company participates have been favorable and are expected to continue to increase. 


• | SIFCO supplies new and spare components to the energy industry, particularly the industrial gas and steam turbine markets. The industrial gas and steam turbine markets have experienced a downturn in demand for new units in the near term. The overall market is forecasting to be down due to green technology alternatives gaining market share that was previously held by gas and steam turbine companies. SIFCO has positioned itself to support OEM production in a more limited role, but with flexibility to address the demand cycle in this segment as well as continuing to support the aftermarket. 

Competition
SIFCO competes with numerous companies, approximately fifteen of which are known by SIFCO, and some of which are non-U.S. based companies.  Many of these companies focus within the A&E markets. SIFCO believes that it has an advantage in the primary markets it serves due to: (i) demonstrating A&E expertise; (ii) focusing on quality and customer service; (iii) operating initiatives such as SMART (Streamlined Manufacturing Activities to Reduce Time/Cost) and Six Sigma; and (iv) offering a broad range of capabilities. SIFCO competes with both U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers of forgings, some of which are significantly larger than SIFCO. As customers establish new facilities throughout the world, SIFCO will continue to encounter non-U.S. competition. SIFCO believes it can expand its market share by (i) continuing to increase capacity utilization; (ii) broadening its product lines through investment in equipment that expands its manufacturing capabilities; and (iii) developing new customers in markets where the participants require similar technical competence and service as those in the A&E industries.
Customers
During fiscal 2019, SIFCO had three customers, from the various business units, account for 44% of consolidated net sales; and 50% of the Company's consolidated net sales were from four customers and to their direct subcontractors, which individually accounted for 14%, 13%, 12% and 11%, respectively, of consolidated net sales. SIFCO believes that the loss of sales to such customers would result in a material adverse impact on the business. However, SIFCO has maintained a business relationship with these customers for many years and is currently conducting business with them under multi-year agreements. Although there is no assurance that this will continue, historically, as one or more major customers have reduced their purchases, SIFCO has generally been successful in gaining new business, thereby avoiding a material adverse impact on the Company. SIFCO relies on its ability to adapt its services and operations to changing requirements of the market in general and its customers in particular. No material part of SIFCO’s business is seasonal. For additional financial information about geographic areas, refer to Note 11, Business Information, of the consolidated financial statements.
Backlog of Orders
SIFCO’s total backlog as of September 30, 2019 increased to $117.6 million, compared with $99.7 million as of September 30, 2018. Orders for delivery scheduled within the upcoming fiscal year 2020 increased to $93.8 million compared with $73.7 million scheduled in fiscal 2019. Orders may be subject to modification or cancellation by the customer with limited charges. The increase in total backlog as of September 30, 2019 compared with the previous year is primarily due to newly acquired part numbers won by the Company in fiscal 2019 along with some impact related to the sales recovery from the fire at Orange and timing of long-term agreement negotiations. Backlog information may not be indicative of future sales.

C. | Environmental Regulations

The Company is required to comply with various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. The costs of such compliance have not had, and are not presently expected to have, a material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company and its subsidiaries under existing regulations and interpretations.

D. | Employees

The number of SIFCO employees decreased from approximately 453 at the beginning of fiscal 2019 to approximately 434 employees at the end of fiscal 2019. The reduction in employee headcount is a result of productivity improvements across the business and the fire incident that occurred at the Orange location. The Company is a party to collective bargaining agreements ("CBA") with certain employees located at the Cleveland plant (expires in May 2020). The Cleveland location has two bargaining units; the Company went into early negotiations and ratified its CBA with one such unit in November 2019 and is expected to enter negotiations with the second unit in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The Maniago location is party to the National Collective Agreement in metal working (expires in December 2019). Negotiations have begun with Maniago; however, until an agreement is reached, Maniago will continue to apply existing terms of its current contract. 

E. | Non-U.S. Operations

The Company's products are distributed in the U.S. as well as non-U.S. markets. 
Financial information about the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. operations is set forth in Note 11, Business Information, of the consolidated financial statements.
