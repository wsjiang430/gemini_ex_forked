Our Business
 
We are a manufacturer of precision, large-scale fabricated and machined metal components and systems. We offer a full range of services required to transform raw materials into precision finished products. We sell these finished products to customers in three main industry groups: defense, energy and precision industrial. The finished products are used in a variety of markets including: defense, aerospace, nuclear, medical and precision industrial. Our mission is to be a leading end-to-end service provider to our markets by furnishing custom, fully integrated solutions for complete products that require custom fabrication, precision machining, assembly, integration, inspection, non-destructive evaluation and testing.
 
We work with our customers to manufacture products in accordance with the customers’ drawings and specifications. Our work complies with specific national and international codes and standards applicable to our industry. We believe that we have earned our reputation through outstanding technical expertise, attention to detail, and a total commitment to quality and excellence in customer service.
 
About Us
 
We are a Delaware corporation, organized in 2005 under the name Lounsberry Holdings II, Inc. On February 24, 2006, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary Ranor, Inc., or Ranor. Ranor, together with its predecessors, has been in continuous operation since 1956. Since February 24, 2006, our primary business has been the business of Ranor. On March 6, 2006, following the acquisition of Ranor, we changed our corporate name to TechPrecision Corporation. Our acquisition of Ranor was accounted for as a reverse acquisition.
 
Wuxi Critical Mechanical Components Co., Ltd., or WCMC, a limited company organized under the laws of the People’s Republic of China, or China, located in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, China, is our other wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
Our executive offices are located at 1 Bella Drive, Westminster, Massachusetts 01473, and our telephone number is (978) 874-0591. Our website is www.techprecision.com. Information on our website, or any other website, is not incorporated by reference in this annual report.
 
References in this annual report to “the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and similar words refer to TechPrecision Corporation and its subsidiaries, Ranor and WCMC, unless the context indicates otherwise, while references to “TechPrecision” refer to TechPrecision Corporation and not its subsidiaries. 
 
General
 
Our manufacturing operations within the United States are situated on approximately 65 acres in North Central Massachusetts. Our 145,000 square foot facility houses state-of-the-art equipment which gives us the capability to manufacture products as large as 100 tons. We offer a full range of services required to transform raw material into precision finished products. Our manufacturing capabilities include: fabrication operations (cutting, press and roll forming, assembly, welding, heat treating, blasting and painting) and machining operations including CNC (computer numerical controlled) horizontal and vertical milling centers. We also provide support services to our manufacturing capabilities: manufacturing engineering (planning, fixture and tooling development, and manufacturing), quality control (inspection and testing), materials procurement, production control (scheduling, project management and expediting), and final assembly.
 
All manufacturing is done in accordance with our written quality assurance program, which meets specific national codes, and international codes, standards, and specifications. Ranor holds several certificates of authorization issued by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors. The standards used are specific to the customer’s needs, and we have implemented such standards into our manufacturing operations.
 
We maintain a representative office in China. At March 31, 2019, we did not have any open customer orders for WCMC in our backlog. We are evaluating how, and if, to utilize the WCMC entity moving forward.

Products
 
We manufacture a wide variety of products pursuant to customer contracts and based on individual customer needs. We can also provide manufacturing engineering services to assist customers in optimizing their engineering designs for manufacturing efficiency. We do not design the products we manufacture, but rather manufacture according to “build-to-print” requirements specified by our customers. Accordingly, we do not distribute the products that we manufacture on the open market and we do not market any specific products on an on-going basis. We do not own the intellectual property rights to any proprietary marketed product, and we do not manufacture products in anticipation of orders. Manufacturing operations do not commence on any project before we receive a customer’s purchase order. All contracts cover specific products within the capability of our resources.
 
Although our focus is to provide long-term integrated solutions to our customers on continuous production programs, our activities include a variety of both custom-based and production-based requirements. The custom-based work is typically either a prototype or unique, one-of-a-kind product. The production-based work is repeat work or a single product with multiple quantity releases.
 
Changes in market demand for our manufacturing expertise can be significant and sudden and require us to be able to adapt to the collective needs of the customers and industries that we serve. Understanding this dynamic, we have developed the capability to transform our workforce to manufacture products for customers across different industries.
 
We serve our customers in the defense, aerospace, nuclear, medical and precision industrial markets. Examples of products we have manufactured within such industries during recent years include, but are not limited to custom components for ships and submarines, aerospace equipment, components for nuclear power plants and components for large scale medical systems.
 
Source of Supply
 
Our manufacturing operations are partly dependent on the availability of raw materials. Most of our contracts with customers require the use of customer-supplied raw materials in the manufacture of their product. Accordingly, raw material requirements vary with each contract and are dependent upon customer requirements and specifications. We have established relationships with numerous suppliers. When we do buy raw materials, we endeavor to establish alternate sources of material supply to reduce our dependency on any one supplier.
 
Our projects include the manufacturing of products from various traditional as well as specialty metal alloys. These materials may include, but are not limited to: steel, nickel, monel, inconel, aluminum, stainless steel, and other alloys. Certain of these materials are subject to long-lead time delivery schedules. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, or fiscal 2019, three suppliers accounted for 10% or more of our purchased material. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, or fiscal 2018, four suppliers accounted for 10% or more of our purchased material.
 
Marketing
 
While we have significant customer concentration, we endeavor to broaden our customer base as well as the industries we serve. We market to our existing customer base and also initiate contacts with new potential customers through various sources including personal contacts, customer referrals, and referrals from other businesses. A significant portion of our business is the result of competitive bidding processes and a significant portion of our business is from contract negotiation. We believe that the reputation we have developed with our current customers represents an important part of our marketing effort.
 
Requests for quotations received from customers are reviewed to determine the specific requirements and our ability to meet such requirements. Quotations are prepared by estimating the material and labor costs and assessing our current backlog to determine our delivery commitments. Competitive bid quotations are submitted to the customer for review and award of contract. Negotiation bids typically require the submission of additional information to substantiate the quotation. The bidding process can range from several weeks for a competitive bid to several months for a negotiation bid before the customer awards a contract.
 
Research and Product Development
 
Many of our customers generate drawings illustrating their projected unit design and technology requirements. Our research and product development activities are limited and focused on delivering robust production solutions to such projected unit design and technology requirements. We follow this product development methodology in all our major product lines. We incurred no expenses for research and development in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.
Principal Customers
 
A significant portion of our business is generated by a small number of major customers. The balance of our business consists of discrete projects for numerous other customers. As industry and market demand changes, our major customers may also change. Our ten largest customers generated approximately 98% and 97% of our total revenue in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. Our group of largest customers can change from year to year. Our largest single customer in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 was a prime defense contractor and accounted for 32% and 29% of our net sales during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. Our defense customers are engaged in the development, delivery and support of advanced defense, security and aerospace systems, including the U.S. Navy’s Virginia-class fast attack submarine program and the U.S. Navy’s Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine program. We also serve customers who supply components to the nuclear power industry, and we build components and major assemblies for large scale medical systems for installation at certain medical institutions.

We historically have experienced, and continue to experience, customer concentration. A significant loss of business from our largest customer or a combination of several of our significant customers could result in lower operating profitability and/or operating losses if we are unable to replace such lost revenue from other sources.  The revenue derived from all of our customers in the designated industry groups for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 are displayed in the table below:
 

(dollars in thousands) | 2019 | | 2018 
-----------------------+--------+--------+--------
Net Sales | Amount | | Percent | | Amount | | Percent
Defense | $ | 14,037 | | 84 | % | $ | 15,774 | 84 | %
Energy | $ | 2,404 | | 14 | % | $ | 2,252 | 12 | %
Precision Industrial | $ | 262 | | 2 | % | $ | 704 | 4 | %

 
The following table displays revenue generated by individual customers in specific industry sectors that accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in either fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018:
 

(dollars in thousands) | 2019 | | 2018 
-----------------------+--------+-------+--------
Net Sales | Amount | | Percent | | Amount | | Percent
Defense Customer 1 | $ | 5,333 | | 32 | % | $ | 5,463 | 29 | %
Defense Customer 2 | $ | 3,224 | | 19 | % | $ | * | * | %
Defense Customer 3 | $ | 3,197 | | 19 | % | $ | 4,978 | 27 | %

 
* Revenue from the customer in this market was less than 10% of our total revenue during the period.
 
At March 31, 2019, we had a backlog of orders totaling approximately $12.6 million. We expect to deliver the backlog over the course of the next two fiscal years. The comparable backlog at March 31, 2018 was $14.0 million. There was no revenue generated by WCMC in fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018. At March 31, 2019, we did not have any open customer orders for WCMC in our backlog.
 
Competition
 
We face competition from both domestic and foreign manufacturers in the manufacture of metal fabricated and machined precision components and equipment. The industry in which we compete is fragmented with no one dominant player. We compete against companies that are both larger and smaller in size and capacity. Some competitors may be better known, have greater resources at their disposal, and have lower production costs. For certain products, being a domestic manufacturer may play a role in determining whether we are awarded a certain contract. Specifically, we face only limited foreign competition for our defense products. For other products, we may be competing against foreign manufacturers who have a lower cost of production. If a contracting party has a relationship with a vendor and is required to place a contract for bids, the preferred vendor may provide or assist in the development of the specification for the product which may be tailored to that vendor’s products. In such event, we would be at a disadvantage in seeking to obtain that contract. We believe that customers focus on such factors as the quality of work, the reputation of the vendor, the perception of the vendor’s ability to meet the required schedule, and price in selecting a vendor for their products.
Government Regulations
 
A significant portion of our manufacturing services are provided as a subcontractor to prime government contractors. Such prime government contractors are subject to government procurement and acquisition regulations which give the government the right to terminate these contracts for convenience, certain renegotiation rights, and rights of inspection. Any government action which affects our customers who are prime government contractors would affect us.
 
Because of the nature and use of our products, we are subject to compliance with quality assurance programs, compliance with which is a condition for our ability to bid on government contracts and subcontracts. We believe we are in compliance with all of these programs.
 
We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to manufacturing operations, such as federal and state occupational health and safety laws, and environmental laws, which are discussed in more detail below under “Environmental Compliance.” WCMC operates under a business license granted by the appropriate government authorities in China. WCMC must operate under the terms and scope of that license in order to maintain its right to conduct business operations in China.

Environmental Compliance
 
We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated by those laws and the filing of reports with environmental agencies, and we are subject to periodic inspections to monitor our compliance. We believe that we are currently in compliance with applicable environmental regulations. As part of our normal business practice, we are required to develop and file reports and maintain logbooks that document all environmental issues within our organization. We may engage outside consultants to assist us in keeping current on developments in environmental regulations. Expenditures for environmental compliance purposes during fiscal 2019 and 2018 were not material.
Intellectual Property Rights
 
Presently, we have no registered intellectual property rights other than certain trademarks for our name and other business and marketing materials. In the course of our business we develop know-how for use in the manufacturing process. Although we have non-disclosure policies in place with respect to our personnel and in our contractual relationships, we cannot assure you that we will be able to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to this know-how.
Personnel
 
As of March 31, 2019, we had approximately 95 employees, of whom all are full time employees, 22 are salaried and 73 are hourly. None of our employees is represented by a labor union.
