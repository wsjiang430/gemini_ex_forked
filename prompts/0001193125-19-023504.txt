 Nobility Homes, Inc., a Florida corporation incorporated in 1967, designs, manufactures and sells a broad line of manufactured and modular homes through its own retail sales centers throughout Florida. Nobility also sells its manufactured homes on a wholesale basis to independent manufactured home retail dealers and manufactured home communities. All references in this annual report on Form 10-K to Nobility, Company, we, us, or our refer to Nobility Homes, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise suggests. 
 Manufactured Homes 
 Nobilitys homes are available in approximately 100 active models sold under the trade names Kingswood, Richwood, Tropic Isle, Regency Manor, and Special Edition. The homes, ranging in size from 431 to 2,650 square feet and containing from one to five bedrooms, are available in: 

 | Single-wide widths of 12, 14 and 16 feet ranging from 35 to 72 feet in length;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Double-wide widths of 20, 24, 26, 28 and 32 feet ranging from 32 to 72 feet in length;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Triple-wide widths of 42 feet ranging from 60 to 72 feet in length; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Quad-unit with 2 sections 28 feet wide by 48 feet long and 2 sections 28 feet wide by 52 feet long.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our floor plans can be built as an on-frame modular home. We have been approved to build A.N.S.I. (American National Standards Institute) Park models less than 400 square feet and exposure D homes. 
 Nobilitys homes are sold primarily as unfurnished dwellings ready for permanent occupancy. Interiors are designed and color coordinated in a range of decors. Depending on the size of the unit and quality of appliances and other appointments, retail prices for Nobilitys homes typically range from approximately $30,000 to $130,000. Most of the prices of Nobilitys homes are considered by it to be within the low to medium price range of the industry. 
 Nobilitys manufacturing plant utilizes assembly line techniques in manufactured home production. The plant manufactures and assembles the floors, sidewalls, end walls, roofs and interior cabinets for their homes. Nobility purchases, from outside suppliers, various other components that are built into its homes including the axles, frames, tires, doors, windows, pre-finished sidings, plywood, ceiling panels, lumber, rafters, insulation, gypsum board, appliances, lighting and plumbing fixtures, carpeting and draperies. Nobility is not dependent upon any one particular supplier for its raw materials or component parts, and is not required to carry significant amounts of inventory to assure itself of a continuous allotment of goods from suppliers. 
 Nobility generally does not manufacture its homes to be held by it as inventory (except for model home inventory of its wholly-owned retail network subsidiary, Prestige Home Centers, Inc.), but, rather, manufactures its homes after receipt of orders. Although Nobility attempts to maintain a consistent level of production of homes throughout the fiscal year, seasonal fluctuations do occur, with sales of homes generally lower during the first fiscal quarter due to the holiday season. 
 The sales area for a manufactured home manufacturer is limited by substantial delivery costs of the finished product. Nobilitys homes are delivered by outside trucking companies. Nobility estimates that it can compete effectively within a range of approximately 350 miles from its manufacturing plant in Ocala, Florida. Substantially all of Nobilitys sales are made in Florida. 
 Retail Sales 
 Prestige Home Centers, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, operates ten retail sales centers in north and central Florida. Its principal executive offices are located at Nobilitys headquarters in Ocala, Florida. Sales by Prestige accounted for 76% and 72% of Nobilitys sales during fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 Each of Prestiges retail sales centers are located within 350 miles of Nobilitys Ocala manufacturing facility. Prestige owns the land at six of its retail sales centers and leases the remaining four retail sales centers from unaffiliated parties under leases with terms between one and three years with renewal options. 
 Prestige has executed a lease and is in the process of opening an eleventh retail sales center in north Florida.

 The primary customers of Prestige are homebuyers who generally purchase manufactured homes to place on their own home sites. Prestige operates its retail sales centers with a model home concept. Each of the homes displayed at its retail sales centers is furnished and decorated as a model home. Although the model homes may be purchased from Prestiges model home inventory, generally, customers order homes which are shipped directly from the factory to their home site. Prestige sales generally are to purchasers living within a radius of approximately 100 miles from the selling retail lot. The Companys internet-based marketing program generates numerous leads which are directed to the Prestige retail sales centers to assist a potential buyer in purchasing a home. 
 The retail sale of manufactured homes is a highly competitive business. Because of the number of retail sales centers located throughout Nobilitys market area, potential customers typically can find several sales centers within a 100 mile radius of their present home. Prestige competes with over 100 other retailers in its primary market area, some of which may have greater financial resources than Prestige. In addition, manufactured homes offered by Prestige compete with site-built housing. 
 Prestige does not itself finance customers new home purchases. Financing for home purchases has historically been available from other independent sources that specialize in manufactured housing lending and banks that finance manufactured home purchases. Prestige and Nobility are not required to sign any recourse agreements with any of these retail financing sources. 
 Investments in Limited Partnerships 
 The Company has a 31.3% investment interest in Walden Woods South LLC (Walden Woods South), which owns and operates a 236 residential lot manufactured home community named Walden Woods South located in Homosassa, Florida. The majority owner of Walden Woods South is the Companys President (see Note 4 to the Companys financial statement included herein).     
 On March 31, 2016, the Company sold its 48.5% limited partnership interest in CRF III, Ltd. (Cypress Creek) for $3,990,000. Cypress Creek is a retirement manufactured home community located in Winter Haven, Florida. The Company received $960,000 cash, net of $40,000 cost paid and a note receivable for $3,030,000 that accrued interest at 3.0%. The Company received a $500,000 payment in June 2016, a $1,000,000 payment in January 2017 and a $1,651,924 payment in April 2018 which included all of the remaining principal and interest on the note. 
 Insurance and Financial Services 
 Mountain Financial, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prestige Home Centers, Inc., is an independent insurance agent and licensed mortgage loan originator. Its principal activity is providing retail insurance services, which involves placing various types of insurance, including property and casualty, automobile and extended home warranty coverage, with insurance underwriters on behalf of its Prestige customers in connection with their purchase and financing of manufactured homes. As agent, we solely assist our customers in obtaining various types of insurance and extended warranty coverage with insurance underwriters. As such, we have no agreements with homeowners and/or third party insurance companies other than agency agreements with various insurance carriers. The Company provides appropriate reserves for policy cancellations based on numerous factors, including past transaction history with customers, historical experience and other information, which is periodically evaluated and adjusted as deemed necessary. In the opinion of management, no reserve was deemed necessary for policy cancellations for fiscal years 2018 and 2017. 
Wholesale Sales to Manufactured Home Communities 
 Nobility also sells its homes on a wholesale basis through two full-time salespersons to approximately 35 manufactured home communities and independent dealers. Nobility continues to seek new opportunities in the areas in which it operates, as there is ongoing turnover in the manufactured home communities as they achieve full occupancy levels. As is common in the industry, most of Nobilitys independent dealers sell homes produced by several manufacturers. Sales to one publicly traded REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) which owns multiple retirement communities in our market area accounted for $2,097,200 or 5% of our total sales in fiscal year 2018 and $1,602,185 or 4% of our total sales in fiscal year 2017.    Other companies which own multiple retirement communities in our market area accounted for $1,195,155 or 3% of our total sales in fiscal year 2018 and $2,155,575 or 6% of our total sales in fiscal year 2017. 
 Nobility does not generally offer consigned inventory programs or other credit terms to its dealers and ordinarily receives payment for its homes within 15 to 30 days of delivery. However, Nobility may offer extended terms to park dealers who do a high volume of business with Nobility. In order to stimulate sales, Nobility sells homes for display to related manufactured home communities on extended terms and recognizes revenue when the homes are sold to the end users. The high visibility of Nobilitys homes in such communities generates additional sales of its homes through such dealers.

 Regulation 
 The manufacture, distribution and sale of homes are subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has adopted national construction and safety standards that preempt state standards. In addition, HUD regulations require that manufactured homes be constructed to more stringent wind load and thermal standards. Compliance with these standards involves approval by a HUD approved engineering firm of engineering plans and specifications on all models. HUD has also promulgated rules requiring producers of manufactured homes to utilize wood products certified by their suppliers to meet HUDs established limits on formaldehyde emissions and to place in each home written notice to prospective purchasers of possible adverse reaction from airborne formaldehyde in homes. HUDs standards also require periodic inspection by state or other third party inspectors of plant facilities and construction procedures, as well as inspection of manufactured home units during construction. In addition, some components of manufactured homes may also be subject to Consumer Product Safety Commission standards and recall requirements. Modular homes manufactured by Nobility are required to comply with the Florida Building Code established by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulations. 
 Nobility estimates that compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection laws will have no material effect upon capital expenditures for plant or equipment modifications or earnings for the next fiscal year. 
 The transportation of manufactured homes is subject to state regulation. Generally, special permits must be obtained to transport the home over public highways and restrictions are imposed to promote travel safety including restrictions relating to routes, travel periods, speed limits, safety equipment and size. 
 Nobilitys homes are subject to the requirements of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and Federal Trade Commission rulings which regulate warranties on consumer products. Nobility provides a limited warranty of one year on the structural components of its homes. 
 Competition 
 The manufactured home industry is highly competitive. The initial investment required for entry into the business of manufacturing homes is not unduly large. State bonding requirements for entry in the business vary from state to state. The bond requirement for Florida is $50,000. Nobility competes directly with other manufacturers, some of whom are both considerably larger and possess greater financial resources than Nobility. Nobility estimates that of the 18 manufacturers selling in the state, approximately 10 manufacture homes of the same type as Nobility and compete in the same market area. Nobility believes that it is generally competitive with most of those manufacturers in terms of price, service, warranties and product performance. 
Employees 
 As of January 11, 2019, the Company had 149 full-time employees, including 36 employed by Prestige. Approximately 86 employees are factory personnel compared to approximately 85 in such positions a year ago and 63 are in management, administrative, supervisory, sales and clerical positions (including 33 management and sales personnel employed by Prestige) compared to approximately 62 a year ago. In addition, Nobility employs part-time employees when necessary. 
 Nobility makes contributions toward employees group health and life insurance. Nobility, which is not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, has not experienced any work stoppage or labor disputes and considers its relationship with employees to be generally satisfactory.
