As a result, trade duties were imposed on the subject imports for a five-year period to create a fairer competitive environment in the United States. The duty was extended and increased for an additional five-year period in 2017, and will be subject to renewal in 2022. We believe Lamons offers a broader gasket and bolt product portfolio than its competitors, as most tend to focus on either gaskets or bolts, but not both. Also, there is a wide range of end markets that consume gasket and bolt products, and Lamons primarily serves midstream and downstream petrochemical and refinery applications. As such, Lamons competes with a wide variety of companies depending on geography and product content, including ERIKS, Flexitallic Group, Garlock (EnPro), GHX, Klinger and Lone Star, but rarely is directly competing with another company across all products. Arrow Engine tends to compete against natural gas powered, lower horsepower, multi-cylinder engines from manufacturers such as Caterpillar, Chevy, Cummins and Ford industrial engines and electric motors.

TriMas' Acquisition Strategy
TriMas' capital allocation priorities include reinvesting in production capability and capacity of our businesses, executing treasury actions, such as share buybacks, and accelerating product and geographic expansion through mergers and acquisitions, all while maintaining a disciplined approach to net leverage. We believe that TriMas has opportunities to grow through strategic acquisitions that enhance the strengths of our core businesses. We typically seek "bolt-on" acquisitions, in which we acquire another industry participant or adjacent product lines that expand our existing product offerings, gain access to new customers, end markets and distribution channels, expand our geographic footprint and/or capitalize on scale and cost efficiencies. Our primary focus is on bolt-on acquisition candidates in the Packaging and Aerospace segments, as we believe these segments offer the highest growth and performance profile. While we would also consider opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions in our other, or even a new segment, such transactions are of secondary focus.
Materials and Supply Arrangements
Our largest raw material purchases are for steel, polyethylene and other resins, aluminum, titanium and copper. Raw materials and other supplies used in our operations are normally available from a variety of competing suppliers. In addition to raw materials, we purchase a variety of components and finished products from low-cost sources in China, India, Mexico, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam.
Steel is purchased primarily from steel mills and service centers with pricing contracts principally in the three-to-six month time frame. Changing global dynamics for steel production and supply will continue to present a challenge to our business. Polyethylene is generally a commodity resin with multiple suppliers capable of providing product globally. 
Historically, we have experienced volatility in costs of our raw material purchases and have worked with our suppliers to manage costs and disruptions in supply. We also utilize pricing programs to pass increased steel, resin and other raw material costs to customers. Although we may experience delays in our ability to implement price increases, we have been generally able to recover such increased costs.
Employees and Labor Relations
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 4,000 people, of which approximately 44% were located outside the United States and 16% were unionized. We currently have collective bargaining agreements covering four facilities worldwide, two of which are in the United States. The two facilities outside the United States with collective bargaining agreements are associated with state-controlled unions. 
We believe employee relations are good and are not aware of any present active union organizing activities at any of our facilities. We cannot predict the impact of any further unionization of our workplace. Our labor agreement with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America at our TriMas Aerospace facility in Commerce, California expired in August 2018, at which time we revised the collective bargaining agreement, which now extends to 2021.
Seasonality and Backlog
Our business does not experience significant seasonal fluctuation, other than our fourth quarter, which has tended to be the lowest net sales quarter of the year given holiday shutdowns by certain of our customers and other customers deferring capital spending to the new year. We do not consider sales order backlog to be a material factor in our businesses. Our TriMas Aerospace customers often provide a forward view of build rates and need for products, but firm orders do not extend for more than a few months, and are not guaranteed and subject to change.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges and chemical and hazardous waste management and disposal. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners' or operators' releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require the obtainment and compliance with environmental permits. To date, costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. However, the nature of our operations and our long history of industrial activities at certain of our current or former facilities, as well as those acquired, could potentially result in material environmental liabilities.
Current laws and regulations have not had a material impact on our business, capital expenditures or financial position. However, we must comply with existing and pending climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties or accords. Future events, including those relating to climate change or greenhouse gas regulation could require us to incur expenses related to the modification or curtailment of operations, installation of pollution control equipment or investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites.

Intangible Assets
Our identified intangible assets, consisting of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names and technology, are recorded at approximately $174.5 million at December 31, 2018, net of accumulated amortization. The valuation of each of the identified intangibles was performed using broadly accepted valuation methodologies and techniques.
Customer Relationships. We have developed and maintained stable, long-term selling relationships with customer groups for specific branded products and/or focused market product offerings within each of our businesses. Useful lives assigned to customer relationship intangibles range from five to 25 years and have been estimated using historic customer retention and turnover data. Other factors considered in evaluating estimated useful lives include the diverse nature of focused markets and products of which we have significant share, how customers in these markets make purchases and these customers' position in the supply chain. We also monitor and evaluate the impact of other evolving risks including the threat of lower cost competitors and evolving technology.
Trademarks and Trade Names. Each of our businesses designs and manufactures products for focused markets under various trade names and trademarks (see discussion above by reportable segment). Our trademark/trade name intangibles are well-established and considered long-lived assets that require maintenance through advertising and promotion expenditures. Because it is our practice and intent to maintain and to continue to support, develop and market these trademarks/trade names for the foreseeable future, we consider our rights in these trademarks/trade names to have an indefinite life, except as otherwise dictated by applicable law.
Technology. We hold a number of United States and foreign patents, patent applications, and proprietary product and process-oriented technologies within all three of our reportable segments. We have, and will continue to dedicate, technical resources toward the further development of our products and processes in order to maintain our competitive position in the industrial, commercial and consumer end markets that we serve. Estimated useful lives for our technology intangibles range from one to 30 years and are determined in part by any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit useful life. For example, patent rights have a maximum limit of 20 years in the United States. Other factors considered include the expected use of the technology by the operating groups, the expected useful life of the product and/or product programs to which the technology relates, and the rate of technology adoption by the industry.
International Operations
Approximately 13.9% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were derived from sales by our businesses located outside of the United States, and we may expand our international operations through organic growth actions and acquisitions. In addition, approximately 15.8% of our long-lived assets as of December 31, 2018 were located outside of the United States. We operate manufacturing facilities in Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, India, Italy (as a result of the January 2019 acquisition of Plastic Srl), Mexico, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom and Vietnam. In addition to the net sales derived from sales by our businesses located outside of the United States, we also generated approximately $72.7 million of export sales from the United States. For information pertaining to the net sales and long-lived assets attributed to our international operations, refer to Note 18, "Segment Information," included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," within this Form 10-K.
