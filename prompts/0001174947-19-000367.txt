 Overview
 NI Holdings is a North Dakota business corporation that is the stock holding company of Nodak Insurance Company and became such in connection with the conversion of Nodak Mutual Insurance Company from a mutual to stock form of organization and the creation of a mutual holding company. The conversion was consummated on March 13, 2017. Immediately following the conversion, all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Nodak Insurance Company were issued to Nodak Mutual Group, which then contributed the shares to NI Holdings in exchange for 55% of the outstanding shares of common stock of NI Holdings. Nodak Insurance Company then became a wholly-owned stock subsidiary of NI Holdings. Prior to completion of the conversion, NI Holdings conducted no business and had no assets or liabilities. As a result of the conversion, NI Holdings became the holding company for Nodak Insurance Company and its existing subsidiaries.
 Nodak Insurance was formed in 1946 to offer property and casualty insurance to members of the North Dakota Farm Bureau Federation (“North Dakota Farm Bureau”). Nodak Insurance’s bylaws provide that a person must be a member and remain a member of the North Dakota Farm Bureau in order to become and remain a policyholder of Nodak Insurance. Nodak Insurance’s bylaws also require that four members of the Board of Directors of Nodak Insurance must be members of the North Dakota Farm Bureau. Similarly, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors of Nodak Mutual Group must be persons designated by the North Dakota Farm Bureau.
 The North Dakota Farm Bureau has granted Nodak Insurance a nonexclusive, nontransferable license to use the name “Farm Bureau” and the “FB” logo and associated trademarks to market Nodak Insurance products, including insurance products. Nodak Insurance has held this license since the insurance company’s inception in 1946, and the current version of the license agreement has been in place since 2002. The current license agreement between the North Dakota Farm Bureau and Nodak Insurance renewed on October 1, 2018, with an expiration date of September 30, 2019. The agreement has historically been renewed annually by a vote of the Nodak Insurance Board of Directors. Under the current license agreement, Nodak Insurance is required to pay to the North Dakota Farm Bureau an annual royalty payment equal to 1.3% of Nodak Insurance’s written premiums (excluding multi-peril crop insurance premiums), subject to a minimum annual payment of $900 and a maximum annual payment of $1,341. The maximum royalty payment is adjusted annually based upon the June index month for the Consumer Price Index.
 Nodak Insurance’s subsidiaries include American West Insurance Company (“American West”) and Primero Insurance Company (“Primero”). Battle Creek Mutual Insurance Company is an affiliate of Nodak Insurance. Nodak Insurance and Battle Creek have been assigned “A” ratings by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”), which is the third highest out of 15 possible ratings. American West is rated A-. Primero and Direct Auto are unrated.
 On August 31, 2018, NI Holdings completed the acquisition of 100% of the common stock of Direct Auto Insurance Company (“Direct Auto”) from private shareholders and Direct Auto became a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. The results of Direct Auto are included as part of the Company’s non-standard auto business segment following the closing date.
 The consolidated financial statements of NI Holdings presented herein include the financial position and results of operations of NI Holdings, Direct Auto (after the acquisition date of August 31, 2018), and Nodak Insurance, including Nodak Insurance’s subsidiaries American West and Primero, and its affiliate Battle Creek. Each of the five insurance companies is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the insurance department of its state of domicile.

 Nodak Insurance Company (“Nodak Insurance”)
 Nodak Insurance writes multi-peril crop, crop hail, private passenger automobile, farmowners, homeowners, and commercial property and liability policies in North Dakota. Only members of the North Dakota Farm Bureau can purchase insurance coverage from Nodak Insurance. As of December 31, 2018, Nodak Insurance distributed its insurance products through 74 exclusive agents appointed by Nodak Insurance.

American West Insurance Company (“American West”)
 American West is licensed to write insurance in eight states in the Midwest and Western regions of the United States, but currently issues policies in South Dakota, Minnesota, and North Dakota. American West currently issues multi-peril crop, crop hail, farmowners, private passenger auto, and homeowners insurance primarily in South Dakota. American West distributes its products through independent agents located in approximately 120 offices.
Battle Creek Mutual Insurance Company (“Battle Creek”)
 Battle Creek issues private passenger automobile, homeowners, and farmowners policies in Nebraska. Battle Creek distributes its policies through independent agents located in approximately 270 offices. Battle Creek became affiliated with Nodak Insurance in 2011, and Nodak Insurance provides underwriting, claims management, policy administration, and other administrative services to Battle Creek. Under a 100% quota-share reinsurance agreement, Battle Creek cedes 100% of its net premiums to Nodak Insurance and Nodak Insurance fully reinsures all of Battle Creek’s risk under its insurance policies. In connection with entering into the affiliation agreement, Nodak Insurance purchased a $3.0 million surplus note issued by Battle Creek. The surplus note bears interest at an annual rate of 1.0% and matures on December 30, 2040. Battle Creek must obtain the prior approval of the Nebraska Director of Insurance before making any payment of interest or principal on the surplus note.
 Pursuant to the affiliation agreement, so long as the surplus note remains outstanding or the 100% quota-share reinsurance is in effect, Nodak Insurance is entitled to appoint two-thirds of the Board of Directors of Battle Creek. The affiliation agreement can be terminated by mutual written agreement of Battle Creek and Nodak Insurance or by either party if there is a material breach of the agreement by the other party and such breach is not cured within 15 days after written notice of such breach is given by the terminating party to the other party. If Battle Creek terminated the quota-share reinsurance agreement, it would not have sufficient capital to continue to operate.

Organic Growth Strategy
 We believe we have many opportunities to increase business in our primary markets organically. Strategies we employ to grow organically include:
 
· | continued emphasis on our relationship with the North Dakota Farm Bureau, a key advocacy group for agricultural and rural interests which enjoys a high and favorable profile throughout the state;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | using the cost advantage created by our low expense ratio compared to peers (28.0% expense ratio in 2018 compared to an average expense ratio of our peers of 36.6% in 2017) to selectively expand market share in our primary markets;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion and enhancement of agency relationships in Nebraska and South Dakota, including the use of technology such as mobile apps, online quoting, and policy issuance initiatives to make it easy for independent agents and insureds to do business with us;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | selective expansion of Primero in its core markets of Nevada and Arizona as well as expansion of the non-standard auto product in our core upper Midwest market area;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | strategic growth in Direct Auto non-standard auto business;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | excellent claims service for all insureds; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | selective expansion of our insurance products in states where we currently operate and those states where we hold insurance licenses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

External Growth Strategy
 We acquired Direct Auto in 2018 and integration of this business into our operations is in progress. We successfully acquired Primero in 2014 and acquired control of Battle Creek in 2011. American West was acquired in 2001. With the additional capital we raised through our initial public offering, we desire to make additional selective acquisitions that complement our strategy. Areas of current interest include acquisition of a commercial writer and geographic expansion of existing product lines. The acquisition of a commercial writer would help us to better balance our book of business among personal lines insurance, multi-peril 
  6

crop insurance, and commercial lines insurance in which we currently write only a limited amount of business. Selective geographic expansion would help to diversify our weather-related risks and assist us in maintaining competitive expense levels.
 The completion of our initial public offering supplied the additional capital needed to support substantial increases in premium volume, which we expect to result from the implementation of both our organic and external growth strategies.
 
Products and Services
 Private Passenger Auto
 Nodak Insurance, Battle Creek, and American West each write private passenger auto insurance to provide protection against liability for bodily injury and property damage arising from automobile accidents and protection against loss from damage to automobiles owned by the insured. Private passenger auto accounted for $67,038 (29.8%) of direct premiums written by the Company on a consolidated basis during 2018.
Non-standard Auto
 Primero and Direct Auto write non-standard auto insurance with a focus on minimum-limit auto liability coverage. Direct premiums written on non-standard auto insurance during 2018 were $27,423 (12.2%) of direct premiums written by the Company on a consolidated basis during 2018.
Home and Farm
 Nodak Insurance, Battle Creek, and American West each write homeowners and farmowners policies to provide coverage for damage to buildings, equipment, and contents for a variety of perils, including fire, lightning, wind, hail, and theft. These policies also cover liability arising from injury to other persons or their property while on the insured’s premises. Home and farm accounted for $74,547 (33.1%) of direct premiums written by the Company on a consolidated basis during 2018.
Crop
 Crop hail and multi-peril crop insurance policies are also offered by Nodak Insurance, American West, and Battle Creek. Multi-peril crop insurance is a federal program that protects against crop yield losses from all types of natural causes including drought, excessive moisture, freeze, and disease. Crop hail insurance is a private insurance product designed to provide protection against losses to farmer’s crops due primarily to hail damage. Collectively, crop insurance accounted for $47,504 (21.1%) of direct premiums written by the Company on a consolidated basis during 2018.
All Other
 In addition to the products described above, Nodak Insurance and American West write commercial multi-peril policies and excess liability coverages. Collectively, these other coverages accounted for $8,711 (3.8%) of the direct premiums written by the Company on a consolidated basis during 2018. This segment also includes an assumed reinsurance block of business, with $4,135 of assumed premiums written on a consolidated basis during 2018.
Crop Insurance
 Crop insurance is purchased by agricultural producers, including farmers, ranchers, and others to protect themselves against either the loss of their crops (yield) due to natural disasters, such as hail, drought, and floods, or the loss of revenue due to declines in the prices of agricultural products. The two general categories of crop insurance are generally referred to as “crop-yield insurance” and “crop-revenue insurance”. Crop-yield insurance protects against a reduction in the yield per acre from the historical average yield in a specified area, such as a county or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather grid, while crop-revenue insurance provides protection against declines in the price of the particular crop. Most of the multi-peril crop insurance policies written today combine both yield and revenue protection, with the revenue component providing the policyholder with the option to calculate price-based losses on the higher of the prevailing price when the crop is planted or the price at harvest.
 Beginning in 1980, the U.S. Congress expanded the federal crop insurance program to cover more crops and regions of the country. More importantly, Congress permitted private sector insurers to market and administer federal insurance policies in exchange for an opportunity to earn a profit while bearing a portion of the insurance risk. Congress also authorized a premium subsidy for the farmers and ranchers. As a result, there was a rapid increase in the acres insured from approximately 26 million acres in 1980 to 100 million acres in 1990. The Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 made participation in the crop insurance 
  7

program mandatory for farmers to be eligible to participate in other government support programs and provided a minimum level of free catastrophic risk coverage for insured and noninsured crops.
 In 2018, the federal crop insurance program covered approximately 23.6 million acres in North Dakota, 18.3 million acres in South Dakota, 17.6 million acres in Minnesota, and 335.4 million acres nationwide. In 2018, Nodak Insurance multi-peril crop insurance policies covered approximately 1.8 million acres in North Dakota. During the same period, American West crop insurance policies covered approximately 13,000 acres in South Dakota and approximately 139,000 acres in Minnesota. Nodak Insurance, through its Battle Creek affiliate, writes a very small amount of multi-peril crop insurance in Nebraska.
 American Farm Bureau Insurance Services (“AFBIS”) underwrites all of the multi-peril crop and crop hail insurance policies written by Nodak Insurance, American West, and Battle Creek, as well as several other state Farm Bureau-affiliated insurers. AFBIS also processes and administers all claims made by policyholders under such policies. We reimburse AFBIS for its actual loss adjustment expense with respect to the policies issued by us and pay AFBIS a percentage of the premiums we received with respect to such policies. Nodak Insurance is a shareholder of AFBIS, as is each of the other insurers for whom AFBIS provides such services. AFBIS targets a three percent return on capital and pays all remaining profits to Nodak Insurance and the other shareholders of AFBIS. Nodak Insurance did not receive any material distributions from AFBIS during the years ended December 31, 2016 through 2018.
 
Segment Financial Information
 See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Company’s segment disclosures.
 
Marketing and Distribution
 Our marketing philosophy is to sell profitable business in our core states, using a focused, cost-effective distribution system. Nodak Insurance distributes its insurance products through exclusive agents in North Dakota, while American West, Battle Creek, Primero, and Direct Auto rely on independent producers. We view these independent producers as important partners because they are in a position to recommend either our insurance products or those of a competitor to their customers. We consider our relationships with these producers to be good.
 We review our producers with respect to both premium volume and profitability. Our exclusive agents in Nodak Insurance are hired and trained by our sales staff in North Dakota, while the independent producers in our other companies are appointed by the underwriting or marketing staff for each respective company. We hold regular training sessions when we introduce new products or product changes, or we identify specific topics that may help our producers more effectively market our products.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, no individual producer was responsible for more than 5% of the Company’s direct premiums written by our insurance companies. Direct Auto had six agencies generate more than 5% of their 2018 annual production.
 Producers are compensated through a fixed base commission structure. Agents receive commission as a percentage of premiums (generally 5% to 40%, with a wide variation by product) as their primary compensation from us. The Risk Management Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (“RMA”) establishes the maximum commission that can be paid to producers with respect to crop insurance policies. Battle Creek and American West pay profit sharing commissions to their agencies based on various annual agency premium thresholds and the difference between the agency’s loss ratio and the loss ratio goal established by the insurance company. The commission is paid with respect to all property and casualty (non-crop) business earned within the calendar year. Nodak Insurance pays a profit sharing commission to its agents only with respect to farmowners business originated by such agents.
 Our marketing efforts are further supported by our claims philosophy, which is designed to provide prompt and efficient service and claims processing, resulting in a positive experience for producers and policyholders. We believe that these positive experiences result in higher policyholder retention and new business opportunities when communicated by producers and policyholders to potential customers. While we rely on our independent agents for distribution and customer support, underwriting and claim handling responsibilities are retained by us. Many of our agents have had direct relationships with us for a number of years.
 
Underwriting, Risk Assessment and Pricing
 Our underwriting philosophy is aimed at consistently generating profits through sound risk selection and pricing discipline. Through our management and underwriting staff, we regularly establish rates and rating classifications for our insureds based on loss 
  8

and loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) experience we have developed over the years. We have various rating classifications based on location, type of business, and other risk factors.
 The nature of our business requires that we remain sensitive to the marketplace and the pricing strategies of our competitors. Using the market information as our background, we normally set our prices based on our estimated future costs. From time to time, we may reduce our discounts or apply a premium surcharge to achieve an appropriate return. Pricing flexibility allows us to provide a fair rate commensurate with the assumed risk. If our pricing strategy cannot yield sufficient premium to cover our costs on a particular type of risk, we may determine not to underwrite that risk. It is our philosophy not to sacrifice profitability for premium growth.
 Our competitive strategy in underwriting is to provide very high quality service to our producers and insureds by responding quickly and effectively to information requests and policy submissions. We maintain information on all aspects of our business, which is regularly reviewed to determine both agency and policyholder profitability. Specific information regarding individual insureds is monitored to assist us in making decisions about policy renewals or modifications.
 Our underwriting staff includes 22 employees with over 360 combined years of experience in property and casualty underwriting. They are located primarily at our home office in Fargo, North Dakota, as well as our office in Battle Creek, Nebraska, and underwrite coverage issued by Nodak Insurance, American West and Battle Creek. Primero employs an additional 3 underwriters and Direct Auto employs 4 underwriters in connection with their non-standard auto insurance business. All of our crop insurance is underwritten by AFBIS, as described in an earlier section.
 We strive to be disciplined in our pricing by pursuing rate increases to maintain or improve our underwriting profitability while still being able to attract and retain customers. We utilize pricing reviews that we believe will help us price risks more accurately, improve account retention, and support the production of profitable new business. Our pricing reviews involve evaluating our claims experience and loss trends on a periodic basis to identify changes in the frequency and severity of our claims. We then consider whether our premium rates are adequate relative to the level of underwriting risk as well as the sufficiency of our underwriting guidelines.
 
Claims and Litigation Management
 Our claims management philosophy involves:
 
· | aggressive closure of claims through prompt and thorough investigation of the facts related to the claim;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | equitable settlement of meritorious claims; and
--+------------------------------------------------


· | vigorous defense of unfounded claims as to coverage, liability, or the amount claimed.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our claims team supports our underwriting strategy by working to provide a timely, good faith claims handling response to our policyholders. Claims excellence is achieved by timely investigation and handling of claims, settlement of meritorious claims for equitable amounts, maintenance of adequate case reserves, and control of claims loss adjustment expenses.
 Claims on insurance policies are received directly from the insured or through our producers. Our claims department supports our producer relationship strategy by working to provide a consistently responsive level of claim service to our policyholders.
 Our claims staff is comprised of 45 employees with over 760 years of combined experience in processing property and casualty insurance claims. They are located primarily at our home office in Fargo, North Dakota, but also throughout our coverage areas of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska. Primero also employs 12 claims personnel and Direct Auto employs 29 claims personnel in connection with the non-standard auto insurance business. All claims made under our multi-peril crop and crop hail insurance policies are processed and administered by AFBIS.
 
Technology
 Our insurance operations rely on software to provide the information management systems platform that runs our policy underwriting, policy issuance, claims processing, and accounting functions. These systems permit us to integrate the accounting and reporting functions of all of our insurance operations. We utilize offsite servers for our information systems with daily backup of data. We have adopted a disaster recovery plan, and other risk mitigation practices, tailored to meet our needs and geographic location. We seek to invest continuously in new technology to maximize our business opportunities while protecting our interests and those of our clients.

Enterprise Risk Management
 Our Company is subject to significant risks, in addition to the normal risks of a property and casualty insurance company. These risks are discussed in more detail in the “Item 1A. Risk Factors” section of this Report.
 We consider an enterprise-wide risk management program to be an integral part of managing our business and a key element in our approach to corporate governance. Our Enterprise Risk Management Committee (the “ERMC”) is responsible for the alignment of operational risk management strategies as the coordination point for enterprise-level direction setting with regard to risk management issues. The ERMC regularly monitors risk reports and metrics regarding a variety of continuing and emerging risks that may adversely affect the Company, its policyholders, or other stakeholders. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees risk management and regularly receives reports from the ERMC.
 Cybersecurity risk is an important and evolving focus for the Company. The increased sophistication and activities of unauthorized parties attempting to access our systems is an ever-present risk. Cybersecurity risks may also arise from human error, fraud, or malice on the part of employees or third parties who have authorized access to the Company’s systems or information.
 Our cybersecurity strategy employs a variety of tactics to monitor and assess threat levels, remediate our exposures, and enhance our systems and applications security. The Company collaborates with a third party cybersecurity advisor to provide periodic assessments and recommendations. The Company also requires monthly online security training to be completed by employees.
 Reinsurance
 Reinsurance Ceded
 We reinsure a portion of our exposure and pay to the reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on all policies reinsured. Insurance policies written by us are reinsured with other insurance companies principally to:

· | reduce our net liability exposure on individual risks;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | stabilize our underwriting results; and
--+----------------------------------------


· | increase our underwriting capacity.
--+------------------------------------

 Reinsurance does not legally discharge us, as the insurance company issuing the policy, from primary liability for the full amount due under the reinsured policies, even though the assuming reinsurer is obligated to reimburse the company issuing the policy to the extent of the coverage ceded.
 A primary factor in the selection of reinsurers from whom we purchase reinsurance is their financial strength. Our reinsurance arrangements are generally renegotiated annually or bi-annually. For the year ended December 31, 2018, NI Holdings ceded to reinsurers $30,394 of written premiums, compared to $16,665 of written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $30,748 of written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2016. The higher levels of premiums ceded in 2018 and 2016 were primarily due to additional sharing of multi-peril crop insurance premiums with the federal government as a result of the excellent loss experience in those years.
 The chart below illustrates the reinsurance coverage under our excess of loss treaty for individual casualty risks during the years 2016 through 2018:
 
Losses Incurred | Retained by Nodak Insurance | | Ceded Under Reinsurance Treaty 
--------------------------+-----------------------------+--------+--------------------------------
Up to $600 | | 100.0% | | 0.0% 
$11,400 in excess of $600 | | 0.0% | | 100.0%

 
The chart below illustrates the reinsurance coverage under our excess of loss treaty for individual property risks during the years 2016 through 2018:
 
Losses Incurred | Retained by Nodak Insurance | | Ceded Under Reinsurance Treaty 
--------------------------+-----------------------------+--------+--------------------------------
Up to $500 | | 100.0% | | 0.0% 
$19,500 in excess of $500 | | 0.0% | | 100.0%

As a group, during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, Nodak Insurance, American West, and Battle Creek retained $10,000 of weather-related losses from catastrophic events and had reinsurance under various reinsurance agreements up to $74,600 in excess of the $10,000 retained risk. For 2019, the catastrophe retention amount remains at $10,000 while the catastrophic reinsurance increased to $78,600. Prior to January 1, 2017, the group collectively retained the first $5,000 of weather related losses.
 The insolvency or inability of any reinsurer to meet its obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. NI Holdings’ reinsurance providers, the majority of whom are longstanding partners that understand our business, are all carefully selected with the help of our reinsurance brokers. We monitor the solvency of reinsurers through regular review of their financial statements and their A.M. Best ratings. All of our current reinsurance partners have at least an “A-” financial strength rating from A.M. Best. We dropped one reinsurance partner, Maiden Reinsurance North America, from our program during 2018, due to a ratings decrease by A.M. Best to “B++”. According to A.M. Best, companies with a financial strength rating of “A-” or better “have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders.” We have experienced no significant difficulties collecting amounts due from reinsurers.
 Reinsurance for multi-peril crop insurance is provided by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (“FCIC”). Insurers can assign each policy issued to either its “assigned risk” or “commercial” fund. The FCIC retains an increasing percentage of underwriting losses at successively higher loss ratios while ceding an increasing percentage of the premium at lower loss ratios. The commercial fund permits insurers to retain more of the underwriting gains and losses, while the assigned risk fund cedes up to 80% of the risk to the FCIC. The exact treatment of the commercial fund varies by state groups. In Group 1, which includes Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota and Nebraska, the FCIC retains a larger share of the underwriting gains and a smaller portion of the underwriting losses when compared to all other states. Aggregate stop loss reinsurance is purchased for crop hail and multi-peril insurance. During 2018, we purchased fifty percentage points of coverage above a 100% direct loss ratio for crop hail and we purchased forty-five percentage points of coverage for multi-peril crop above a 105% loss ratio after the FCIC reinsurance protection. This represents the worst loss exposure given the FCIC formula, thereby capping the multi-peril crop loss ratio at 105%.
 The following table sets forth the largest amounts of loss and LAE recoverable by the Company from reinsurers as of December 31, 2018 and the current A.M. Best rating of each as of February 12, 2019.

Reinsurance Assumed
 Nodak Insurance assumes 100% of the risk under policies written by Battle Creek. In addition, Nodak Insurance is required by statute to participate in certain residual market pools. This participation requires Nodak Insurance to assume business for property exposures that are not insured in the voluntary marketplace. Nodak Insurance participates in these residual markets pro rata on a market share basis.
 Additionally, through American Agriculture Insurance Company (affiliated with the American Farm Bureau Federation), Nodak Insurance participates in both domestic and international property insurance pools. Annually, Nodak Insurance reviews the available pools and selects the pools in which it will participate. No multi-peril crop or crop hail insurance policies are included in such pools. Participation in such pools provides Nodak Insurance with the opportunity to diversify its risk while increasing its annual net premiums earned. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, Nodak Insurance assumed $3,945, $3,959, and $3,634, respectively, of written premiums from such pools.
  11

Beginning on January 1, 2016, Nodak Insurance assumed 100% of the crop hail premiums and losses from American West and Rural Mutual Insurance Company (a company affiliated with the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation). The business was then pooled annually with Nodak Insurance’s crop hail business and proportionately retroceded back to each participant. This crop hail pool allows Nodak Insurance and American West to diversify their crop insurance risk across an additional geographic region.
 
Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense
 NI Holdings is required by applicable insurance laws and regulations to maintain reserves for unpaid losses and LAE. Our liability for unpaid losses and LAE consists of (1) case reserves, which are reserves for claims that have been reported to us, and (2) reserves for claims that have been incurred but not yet been reported and for the future development of case reserves (“IBNR”). The laws and regulations require that provision be made for the ultimate cost of those claims without regard to how long it takes to settle them or the time value of money. The determination of reserves involves actuarial and statistical projections of what we expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of such claims. The liability for unpaid losses and LAE is set based on facts and circumstances then known, estimates of future trends in claims severity, and other variable factors such as inflation and changing judicial theories of liability.
 Estimating the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and LAE is an inherently uncertain process. Therefore, the liability for unpaid losses and LAE does not represent an exact calculation of that liability. Our reserving policy recognizes this uncertainty by maintaining reserves at a level providing for the possibility of adverse development relative to the estimation process.
 When a claim is reported to us, our claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment to the extent it can be determined or estimated. This estimate reflects an informed judgment based upon general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of our claims staff. In estimating the appropriate reserve, our claims staff considers the nature and value of the specific claim, the severity of injury or damage, and the policy provisions relating to the type of loss, to the extent determinable at the time. Case reserves are adjusted by our claims staff as more information becomes available. It is our policy to settle each claim as expeditiously as possible.
 We maintain IBNR reserves to provide for already incurred claims that have not yet been reported and development on reported claims. The IBNR reserve is determined by estimating our ultimate net liability for both reported and IBNR claims, and then subtracting the case reserves and paid losses and LAE for reported claims.
 Each quarter, NI Holdings computes its estimated ultimate liability using its methodologies and procedures. However, because the establishment of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process, we cannot assure you that ultimate losses will not exceed the established loss reserves. Adjustments in aggregate reserves, if any, are reflected in the operating results of the period during which such adjustments are made.

The following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending unpaid losses and LAE reserve balances of NI Holdings for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

The estimation process for determining the liability for unpaid losses and LAE inherently results in adjustments each year for claims incurred (but not paid) in preceding years. Negative amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated (favorable development). Positive amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled for amounts greater than originally estimated (unfavorable or adverse development).

The following table shows the development of NI Holding’s liability for unpaid loss and LAE from 2008 through 2018. The top line of the table shows the liabilities at the balance sheet date, including losses incurred but not yet reported. The upper portion of the table shows the cumulative amounts subsequently paid as of successive years with respect to the liability. The lower portion of the table shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The estimates fluctuate as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years. The redundancy (deficiency) exists when the re-estimated liability for each reporting period is less (greater) than the prior liability estimate. The “cumulative redundancy (deficiency)” depicted in the table, for any particular calendar year, represents the aggregate change in the initial estimates over all subsequent calendar years.
 Gross deficiencies and redundancies may be significantly more or less than net deficiencies and redundancies due to the nature and extent of applicable reinsurance.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed income securities by contractual maturity are shown below as of December 31, 2018. Actual maturities could differ from contractual maturities because issuers of the securities may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations, which may or may not include call or prepayment penalties.

 | Amortized Cost | | Fair Value | 
Less than one year | $ | 12,490 | | $ | 12,463 
One through five years | | 96,900 | | | 96,614 
Five through ten years | | 52,128 | | | 51,351

Total debt securities | $ | 257,294 | | $ | 254,969

 
At December 31, 2018, the average maturity of NI Holdings’ fixed income investment portfolio, excluding the Direct Auto portfolio, was 4.38 years and the average duration was 3.46 years. As a result, the fair value of investments may fluctuate significantly in response to changes in interest rates. In addition, NI Holdings may experience investment losses to the extent our liquidity needs require the disposition of fixed income securities in unfavorable interest rate environments.
 NI Holdings uses quoted values and other data provided by independent pricing services as inputs in its process for determining fair values of its investments. The pricing services cover substantially all of the securities in the portfolio for which publicly quoted values are not available. The pricing services’ evaluations represent an exit price, which is a good faith opinion as to what a buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security in a current sale. The pricing is based on observable inputs either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in markets that are active, quoted prices for similar securities at the measurement date, or other inputs that are observable.
 NI Holdings’ investment managers provide pricing information that they utilize, together with information obtained from independent pricing services, to determine the fair value of its fixed income securities. After a detailed review of the information obtained from the pricing services at December 31, 2018 and 2017, no adjustment was made to the values provided.
 The following table sets forth our average cash and invested assets, net investment income, and return on average cash and invested assets for the reported periods:

A.M. Best Ratings
 A.M. Best rates insurance companies based on factors of concern to policyholders. The rating evaluates the claims paying ability of a company, and is not a recommendation of the merits of an investment in our common stock, or the common stock of any other insurer.
 Nodak Insurance and Battle Creek are rated “A” by A.M. Best, which is the third highest out of 15 possible ratings. A.M. Best has affirmed a stable financial strength outlook to both Nodak Insurance and Battle Creek. American West is rated “A-” with a stable financial strength outlook. Primero and Direct Auto are unrated because the nature of the non-standard auto business is not ratings sensitive. In its evaluation of a company, A.M. Best’s Credit Rating Methodology (“BCRM”) builds on a focus of balance sheet strength, operating performance, the business profile, and enterprise risk management. More specifically, the components of the BCRM include:
 
· | the company’s profitability, leverage, and liquidity;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | its book of business, product and geographic diversity, distribution channels, competition, and market position;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  16


· | the quality and appropriateness of its reinsurance program;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | the quality and management of its assets and liabilities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | the adequacy of its reserves and surplus;
--+------------------------------------------


· | its capital structure;
--+-----------------------


· | its pricing sophistication and data quality;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | its regulatory, event, and product risks;
--+------------------------------------------


· | the experience and competence of its management;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | its risk identification, management, appetite, and tolerances; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | its governance and risk culture.
--+---------------------------------

 If we are unable to maintain at least an “A-” rating from A.M. Best, it may impair our ability to compete effectively.
 
Competition
 The property casualty and crop insurance markets are highly competitive. NI Holdings competes with stock insurance companies, mutual companies, and other underwriting organizations. Our largest competitors in North Dakota for private passenger auto and homeowners are Progressive Casualty Insurance Company, State Farm Mutual Insurance Company, American Family Insurance, QBE Insurance Group, Farmers Union Mutual Insurance, and Auto-Owners Insurance. In South Dakota and Nebraska, we have small market shares and our competitors are the large national and regional companies as well as Farmers Mutual of Nebraska. Based on 2017 data, Nodak Insurance is the second largest writer of farmowners insurance in North Dakota. Our largest competitors are Farmers Union Mutual Insurance, North Star Mutual Insurance Company, and American Family Insurance. In Nebraska and South Dakota, we have a small farmowners market share, which is dominated by the large national and regional carriers. Certain of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and operating resources than we do and may be able to offer lower rates or higher commissions to their producers.
 Total industry-reported premiums written for multi-peril crop insurance in 2018 was $875,821 in North Dakota and $575,723 in Minnesota. In North Dakota, our multi-peril crop insurance direct premiums written were $37,374, $39,270, and $38,708 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In Minnesota, our multi-peril crop insurance direct premiums written were $3,980, $4,534, and $3,504 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. NI Holdings wrote less than $500 in multi-peril crop insurance in Nebraska and South Dakota for each of the last three years. The principal competitors in our markets for multi-peril crop insurance are QBE Insurance Group, Chubb Corporation, Rural Community Insurance Services, CGB Enterprises, and Great American Insurance Group.
 The premium rates for multi-peril crop insurance are established by the RMA, and, accordingly, we compete with other insurance companies on factors such as agency relationships, claim service, and market reputation in the crop insurance market. We believe that our relationship with the North Dakota Farm Bureau and our leading market share are significant factors in maintaining our market share of the crop insurance business in North Dakota.
 With respect to writing property and casualty insurance, we compete on a number of factors such as pricing, agency relationships, policy support, claim service, and market reputation. Like other writers of property and casualty insurance, our policy terms vary from state to state based on the prescribed minimum liability limits in each state, as established by state law. We believe our company differentiates itself from many larger companies competing for this business by focusing on ease of doing business and providing excellent claims service with local, knowledgeable employees.
 To compete successfully in the property and casualty insurance market, we rely on our ability to identify insureds that are most likely to produce an underwriting profit, operate with a disciplined underwriting approach, practice prudent claims management, reserve appropriately for unpaid claims, and provide quality service and competitive commissions to our independent and captive agents.

Regulation
 General
 We are subject to extensive regulation, particularly at the state level. The method, extent, and substance of such regulation varies by state, but generally has its source in statutes and regulations that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to state insurance regulatory agencies. In general, such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use insurance products, not the companies that write the policies. These laws and regulations have a significant impact on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters including accounting methods, agent and company licensure, claims procedures, corporate governance, examinations, investing practices, policy forms, pricing, trade practices, reserve adequacy, and underwriting standards.
 State insurance laws and regulations require our insurance company subsidiaries to file financial statements with state insurance departments everywhere they do business, and the operations of such companies and their respective accounts are subject to examination by those departments at any time. Our insurance company subsidiaries prepare statutory-basis financial statements in accordance with accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by the state in which they are domiciled. North Dakota generally conforms to National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) practices and procedures, so its examination reports and other filings generally are accepted by other states.
 Premium rate regulation varies greatly among jurisdictions and lines of insurance. In the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries write insurance, premium rates for the various lines of insurance are subject to either prior approval or limited review upon implementation. The premium rates for multi-peril crop insurance are established by the RMA. See “Item 1. Business — Crop Insurance.”
 Many jurisdictions have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to withdraw from a particular market. For example, states may limit an insurer’s ability to cancel or non-renew policies. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable marketplaces in a timely manner.
 Crop Insurance
 The multi-peril crop insurance business is overseen by the federal government through the RMA. The RMA outlines policy language, establishes premium rates, and develops loss adjustment procedures for insurance programs under the federal crop insurance program. In addition, through the FCIC, the RMA provides premium subsidies to farmers and sets the commission percentages that can be paid to agents. All participating insurance carriers are subject to the same Standard Reinsurance Agreement (“SRA”), which outlines items such as reporting requirements and claims handling procedures, proportional and non-proportional reinsurance terms, and the level of administrative and operating reimbursement paid to insurers. The RMA also provides oversight to the approved insurance providers (“AIPs”). The AIPs are required to use the policies, premium rates, and loss adjustment procedures set by the RMA without modification and are required to issue a policy to any eligible applicant regardless of risk or profitability. The RMA conducts audits of AIPs with respect to claims and loss adjustment procedures.
 American Agricultural Insurance Company is the AIP through which we issue multi-peril crop insurance policies, and is the holder of the SRA with the FCIC.
 Examinations
 Examinations are conducted every three to five years by the Departments of Insurance where the insurance companies are domiciled. Nodak Insurance and American West were last examined by the North Dakota Insurance Department as of December 31, 2016. The final examination report for American West included a finding related to intercompany expense charges between the two companies, which offset in consolidation. The underlying cause of this finding has been resolved.
 Battle Creek was last examined by the Nebraska Insurance Department as of December 31, 2016, and the last examination of Primero by the Nevada Insurance Department was as of December 31, 2016. Neither examination resulted in any adjustments to their financial positions, nor were there any substantive matters raised in the final examination reports.
 Direct Auto was last examined by the Illinois Department of Insurance as of December 31, 2017, for which an examination report has not yet been issued.
 NAIC Risk-Based Capital Requirements
 North Dakota and most other states have adopted the NAIC system of risk-based capital requirements that require insurance companies to calculate and report information under a risk-based formula. These risk-based capital requirements attempt to measure 
  18

statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risks in a company’s mix of products and investment portfolio. Under the formula, a company first determines its “authorized control level” risk-based capital. This authorized control level takes into account (i) the risk with respect to the insurer’s assets; (ii) the risk of adverse insurance experience with respect to the insurer’s liabilities and obligations; (iii) the interest rate risk with respect to the insurer’s business; and (iv) all other business risks and such other relevant risks as are set forth in the risk-based capital instructions. A company’s “total adjusted capital” is the sum of statutory capital and surplus and such other items as the risk-based capital instructions may provide. The formula is designed to allow state insurance regulators to identify weakly capitalized companies.
 The requirements provide for four different levels of regulatory attention. The “company action level” is triggered if a company’s total adjusted capital is less than 2.0 times its authorized control level but greater than or equal to 1.5 times its authorized control level. At the company action level, the company must submit a comprehensive plan to the regulatory authority that discusses proposed corrective actions to improve the capital position. The “regulatory action level” is triggered if a company’s total adjusted capital is less than 1.5 times but greater than or equal to 1.0 times its authorized control level. At the regulatory action level, the regulatory authority will perform a special examination of the company and issue an order specifying corrective actions that must be followed. The “authorized control level” is triggered if a company’s total adjusted capital is less than 1.0 times but greater than or equal to 0.7 times its authorized control level. At this level, the regulatory authority may take action it deems necessary, including placing the company under regulatory control. The “mandatory control level” is triggered if a company’s total adjusted capital is less than 0.7 times its authorized control level. At this level, the regulatory authority is mandated to place the company under its control. The capital levels of our insurance company subsidiaries have never triggered any of these regulatory capital levels. We cannot guarantee, however, that the capital requirements applicable to such companies will not increase in the future.
 NAIC Ratios
 The NAIC has also developed a set of 13 financial ratios referred to as the Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”). Based on statutory-basis financial statements filed with state insurance regulators, the NAIC annually calculates these IRIS ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies. The NAIC has established an acceptable range for each of the IRIS financial ratios. If four or more of its IRIS ratios fall outside the range deemed acceptable by the NAIC, an insurance company may receive inquiries from individual state insurance departments. During each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, none of our insurance company subsidiaries produced results outside the acceptable range for more than three of the IRIS tests.
 Enterprise Risk Assessment
 In 2012, the NAIC adopted various changes to its Model Regulations, herein known as the “NAIC Amendments”. The NAIC Amendments, when adopted by the various states, are designed to respond to perceived gaps in the regulation of insurance holding company systems in the United States. The NAIC Amendments include a requirement that an insurance holding company system’s ultimate controlling person submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an “enterprise risk report”. This enterprise risk report identifies the activities, circumstances, or events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied properly, are likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. While the NAIC Amendments have not been adopted in whole by the North Dakota Insurance Department, North Dakota currently requires insurers domiciled in North Dakota to include an enterprise risk assessment in its annual report. The NAIC Amendments also include provisions requiring a controlling person to submit prior notice to its domiciliary insurance regulator of its divestiture of control, having detailed minimum requirements for cost sharing and management agreements between an insurer and its affiliates, and expanding of the agreements between an insurer and its affiliates to be filed with its domiciliary insurance regulator.
 In 2012, the NAIC also adopted the Own Risk Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) Model Act. The ORSA Model Act, when adopted by the various states, will require an insurance holding company system’s chief risk officer to submit at least annually to its lead state insurance regulator a confidential report detailing its own internal solvency assessment. Such an assessment is to be tailored to the nature, scale, and complexity of an insurer. This assessment will include the material and relevant risks identified by the insurer associated with an insurer’s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks. Although our insurance company subsidiaries are exempt from ORSA because of their size, NI Holdings intends to incorporate those elements of ORSA that it believes constitute “best practices” into its annual internal enterprise risk assessment.
 Market Conduct Regulation
 State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosure to consumers, illustrations, advertising, sales practices, and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.

Guaranty Fund Laws
 All states have guaranty fund laws under which insurers doing business in the state can be assessed to fund policyholder liabilities of insolvent insurance companies. Under these laws, an insurer is subject to assessment depending upon its market share in the state of a given line of business. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we paid no assessments pursuant to state insurance guaranty association laws, although we expect that Direct Auto may pay nominal assessments in the State of Illinois in the future. We establish reserves relating to insurance companies that are subject to insolvency proceedings when it becomes probable that we will be subject to an assessment and the amount of such assessment can be estimated. We cannot predict the amount and timing of any future assessments under these laws.
Federal Regulation
 The U.S. federal government generally has not directly regulated the insurance industry except for certain areas of the market, such as insurance for crops, flood, nuclear, and terrorism risks. However, the federal government has undertaken initiatives or considered legislation in several areas that may affect the insurance industry, including tort reform, corporate governance, and the taxation of reinsurance companies. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Federal Insurance Office, which is authorized to study, monitor, and report to Congress on the insurance industry and to recommend that the Financial Stability Oversight Council designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the U.S. financial stability in the event of the insurer’s material financial distress or failure. In December 2013, the Federal Insurance Office issued a report on alternatives to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increasing national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states. Changes to federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including changes in federal taxation, can also significantly affect the insurance industry and us.
 We are also subject to the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACTA”) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), both of which require us to protect the privacy of our customers’ information, including health and credit information.
 Privacy
 We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws governing the collection, disclosure, and protection of personal and confidential information of our clients or employees. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently, and may conflict. Congress, state legislatures, and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information.
 As mandated by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), states have promulgated laws and regulations that require financial institutions, including insurance companies, to take steps to protect the privacy of certain consumer and customer information. The NAIC has adopted several provisions to facilitate the implementation of the GLBA, including the Privacy of Consumer Financial and Health Information Model Regulation and the Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information Model Regulation. Several states adopted similar provisions regarding the safeguarding of customer information. NI Holdings and its subsidiaries have implemented procedures to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act’s related privacy requirements.
 In October 2017, the NAIC adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law (“IDSML”), which would require insurers, insurance producers, and other entities required to be licensed under state insurance laws to develop and maintain a written information security program, conduct risk assessments, oversee the data security practices of third-party service providers, and other related requirements. It is not clear whether, and to what extent, legislatures or insurance regulators in the states in which we, or our subsidiaries, operate will enact the IDMSL. Such enactments and regulations could raise compliance costs and subject us to the risk of regulatory enforcement actions, penalties, and reputational harm. Any such events could potentially have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
 Office of Foreign Asset Control
 The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”) maintains a list of “Specifically Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons” (“the SDN List”). The SDN List identifies persons and entities that the government believes are associated with terrorists, rogue nations, or drug traffickers. OFAC’s regulations prohibit insurers, among others, from doing business with persons or entities on the SDN List. If the insurer finds and confirms a match, the insurer must take steps to block or reject the transaction, notify the affected person, and file a report with OFAC.
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012
 We are an emerging growth company (“EGC”), as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“the JOBS Act”), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, such as reduced public company reporting, accounting, and corporate governance requirements. We currently intend to avail ourselves of the reduced disclosure obligations available under the JOBS Act.
  20

Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an EGC can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
 We will remain an EGC for up to five years following our initial public offering (“IPO”), or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“the Exchange Act”), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.07 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
 Dividends
 North Dakota law sets the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid by Nodak Insurance to NI Holdings during any twelve-month period after notice to, but without prior approval of, the North Dakota Insurance Department. This amount cannot exceed the lesser of (i) 10% of the insurance company’s surplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding December 31, or (ii) the insurance company’s statutory net income for the preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital gains), less any prior dividends paid during such twelve-month period. In addition, any insurance company other than a life insurance company may carry forward net income from the preceding two calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less any dividends actually paid during those two calendar years. As of December 31, 2018, the amount available for payment of dividends by Nodak Insurance in 2019 without the prior approval of the North Dakota Insurance Department is $17,588. “Extraordinary dividends” in excess of the foregoing limitations may only be paid with prior notice to, and approval of, the North Dakota Insurance Department.
 Illinois law sets the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid by Direct Auto to NI Holdings during any twelve-month period after notice to, but without prior approval of, the Illinois Department of Insurance. This amount cannot exceed the greater of (i) 10% of the Company’s surplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding December 31, or (ii) the Company’s statutory net income for the preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital gains). As of December 31, 2018, the amount available for payment of dividends by Direct Auto in 2019 without the prior approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance is $6,653. Dividends in excess of this amount are considered “extraordinary” and are subject to the approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance.
 See “Item 5. Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities — Dividend Policy.”
 Holding Company Laws
 Most states, including North Dakota, have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems. Each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile and furnish certain information, including information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company group that may materially affect the operations, management, or financial condition of the insurers within the group. Pursuant to these laws, the North Dakota Insurance Department requires disclosure of material transactions involving an insurance company and its affiliates, and requires prior notice and/or approval of certain transactions, such as extraordinary dividends distributed by the insurance company. Under these laws, the North Dakota Insurance Department will have the right to examine us at any time.
 All transactions within our consolidated group affecting our insurance company subsidiaries must be fair and equitable. Notice of certain material transactions between NI Holdings and any person or entity in our holding company system will be required to be given to the North Dakota Insurance Department. Certain transactions cannot be completed without the prior approval of the North Dakota Insurance Department.
 Approval of the state insurance commissioner is required prior to any transaction affecting the control of an insurer domiciled in that state. In North Dakota, the acquisition of 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of an insurer or its holding company is presumed to be a change in control. North Dakota law also prohibits any person or entity from (i) making a tender offer for, or a request or invitation for tenders of, or seeking to acquire or acquiring any voting security of a North Dakota insurer if, after the acquisition, the person or entity would be in control of the insurer, or (ii) effecting or attempting to effect an acquisition of control of or merger with a North Dakota insurer, unless the offer, request, invitation, acquisition, effectuation, or attempt has received the prior approval of the North Dakota Insurance Department.
 
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, NI Holdings and its subsidiaries had 178 total employees. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
