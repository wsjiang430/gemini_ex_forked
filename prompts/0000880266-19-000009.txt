Marketing and Distribution
We distribute products primarily through a network of independent dealers and distributors. Our dealers are responsible for retail sales of equipment to end users and after-sales service and support. Our distributors may sell our products through networks of dealers supported by the distributors, and our distributors also may directly market our products and provide customer service support. Our sales are not dependent on any specific dealer, distributor or group of dealers. 
In some countries, we utilize associates and licensees to provide a distribution channel for our products and a source of low-cost production for certain Massey Ferguson and Valtra products. Associates are entities in which we have an ownership interest, most notably in India. Licensees are entities in which we have no ownership interest. The associate or licensee generally has the exclusive right to produce and sell Massey Ferguson or Valtra equipment in its licensed territory under such tradenames, but may not sell these products outside the licensed territory. We generally license certain technology to these licensees and associates, and we may sell them certain components used in local manufacturing operations.

(2) Consists of approximately 57 countries in Africa, the Middle East, Australia and Asia. 
Dealer Support and Supervision
We believe that one of the most important criteria affecting a farmer’s decision to purchase a particular brand of equipment is the quality of the dealer who sells and services the equipment. We support our dealers in order to improve the quality of our dealer network. We monitor each dealer’s performance and profitability and establish programs that focus on continuous dealer improvement. Our dealers generally have sales territories for which they are responsible.
We believe that our ability to offer our dealers a full product line of agricultural equipment and related replacement parts, as well as our ongoing dealer training and support programs focusing on business and inventory management, sales, marketing, warranty and servicing matters and products, help ensure the vitality and increase the competitiveness of our dealer network. We also maintain dealer advisory groups to obtain dealer feedback on our operations.
We provide our dealers with volume sales incentives, demonstration programs and other advertising support to assist sales. We design our sales programs, including retail financing incentives, and our policies for maintaining parts and service availability with extensive product warranties, to enhance our dealers’ competitive position. 
Manufacturing and Suppliers
Manufacturing and Assembly
We manufacture and assemble our products in 48 locations worldwide, including six locations where we operate joint ventures. Our locations are intended to optimize capacity, technology or local costs. Furthermore, we continue to balance our manufacturing resources with externally-sourced machinery, components and/or replacement parts to enable us to better control costs, inventory levels and our supply of components. We believe that our manufacturing facilities are sufficient to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. Please refer to Item 2, “Properties,” where a listing of our principal manufacturing locations is presented. 
Our AGCO Power engines division produces diesel engines, gears and generating sets. The diesel engines are manufactured for use in a portion of our tractors, combines and sprayers, and also are sold to third parties. AGCO Power specializes in the manufacturing of off-road engines in the 75 to 600 horsepower range. 
 2

Third-Party Suppliers
We externally source some of our machinery, components and replacement parts from third-party suppliers. Our production strategy is intended to optimize our research and development and capital investment requirements and to allow us greater flexibility to respond to changes in market conditions.
We purchase some fully-manufactured tractors from Tractors and Farm Equipment Limited (“TAFE”), Carraro S.p.A. and Iseki & Company, Limited. We also purchase other tractors, implements and hay and forage equipment from various third-party suppliers. Refer to “Related Parties” within Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for further discussion of our relationship with TAFE. 
In addition to the purchase of machinery, third-party suppliers supply us with significant components used in our manufacturing operations. We select third-party suppliers that we believe are low cost, high quality and possess the most appropriate technology. 
We also assist in the development of these products or component parts based upon our own design requirements. Our past experience with outside suppliers generally has been favorable.
Seasonality
Generally, retail sales by dealers to farmers are highly seasonal and are a function of the timing of the planting and harvesting seasons. To the extent practicable, we attempt to ship products to our dealers and distributors on a level basis throughout the year to reduce the effect of seasonal retail demands on our manufacturing operations and to minimize our investment in inventory. Our financing requirements are subject to variations due to seasonal changes in working capital levels, which typically increase in the first half of the year and then decrease in the second half of the year. The fourth quarter is also typically a period for higher retail sales because of our customers’ year-end tax planning considerations, the increase in the availability of funds from completed harvests and the timing of dealer incentives.
Competition
The agricultural industry is highly competitive. We compete with several large national and international full-line suppliers, as well as numerous short-line and specialty manufacturers with differing manufacturing and marketing methods. Our two principal competitors on a worldwide basis are Deere & Company and CNH Industrial N.V. We have regional competitors around the world that have significant market share in a single country or a group of countries.
We believe several key factors influence a buyer’s choice of farm equipment, including the strength and quality of a company’s dealers, the quality and pricing of products, dealer or brand loyalty, product availability, terms of financing and customer service. See “Marketing and Distribution” for additional information.
Engineering and Research
We make significant expenditures for engineering and applied research to improve the quality and performance of our products, to develop new products and to comply with government safety and engine emissions regulations. 
In addition, we also offer a variety of precision farming technologies that provide farmers with the capability to enhance productivity and profitability on the farm. These technologies are installed in our products and include satellite-based steering, field data collection, yield mapping and telemetry-based fleet management systems. 
Wholesale Financing
Primarily in the United States and Canada, we engage in the standard industry practice of providing dealers with floor plan payment terms for their inventories of farm equipment for extended periods, generally through our AGCO Finance joint ventures. The terms of our wholesale finance agreements with our dealers vary by region and product line, with fixed payment schedules on all sales, generally ranging from one to 12 months. In the United States and Canada, dealers typically are not required to make an initial down payment, and our terms allow for an interest-free period generally ranging from one to 12 months, depending on the product. Amounts due from sales to dealers in the United States and Canada are immediately due upon a retail sale of the underlying equipment by the dealer, with the exception of sales of grain storage and protein production systems, as discussed further below. If not previously paid by the dealer, installment payments generally are required beginning after the interest-free period with the remaining outstanding equipment balance generally due within 12 months after shipment. 
 3

In limited circumstances, we provide sales terms, and in some cases, interest-free periods that are longer than 12 months for certain products. These typically are specified programs, predominantly in the United States and Canada, where interest is charged after a period of up to 24 months, depending on the year of the sale and the dealer or distributor ordering or their sales volume during the preceding year. We also provide financing to dealers on used equipment accepted in trade. We generally obtain a security interest in the new and used equipment we finance. 
Typically, sales terms outside the United States and Canada are of a shorter duration, generally ranging from 30 to 180 days. In many cases, we retain a security interest in the equipment sold on extended terms. In certain international markets, our sales are generally backed by letters of credit or credit insurance.
Sales of grain storage and protein production systems both in the United States and in other countries generally are payable within 30 days of shipment. In certain countries, sales of such systems for which the Company is responsible for construction or installation may be contingent upon customer acceptance. Payment terms vary by market and product, with fixed payment schedules on all sales. 
We have an agreement to permit transferring, on an ongoing basis, a majority of our wholesale receivables in North America, Europe and Brazil to our AGCO Finance joint ventures in the United States, Canada, Europe and Brazil. Upon transfer, the wholesale receivables maintain standard payment terms, including required regular principal payments on amounts outstanding and interest charges at market rates. Qualified dealers may obtain additional financing through our U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian finance joint ventures at the joint ventures’ discretion. In addition, AGCO Finance joint ventures may provide wholesale financing directly to dealers in Europe, Brazil and Australia.
Retail Financing
Our AGCO Finance joint ventures offer financing to most of the end users of our products. Besides contributing to our overall profitability, the AGCO Finance joint ventures can enhance our sales efforts by tailoring retail finance programs to prevailing market conditions. Our finance joint ventures are located in the United States, Canada, Europe, Brazil, Argentina and Australia and are owned by AGCO and by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rabobank. Refer to “Finance Joint Ventures” within Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for further information.

In addition, Rabobank is the primary lender with respect to our credit facility and our senior term loan, as are more fully described in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Our historical relationship with Rabobank has been strong, and we anticipate its continued long-term support of our business.
Intellectual Property
We own and have licenses to the rights under a number of domestic and foreign patents, trademarks, trade names and brand names relating to our products and businesses. We defend our patent, trademark and trade and brand name rights primarily by monitoring competitors’ machines and industry publications and conducting other investigative work. We consider our intellectual property rights, including our right to use our trade and brand names, important in the operation of our businesses. However, we do not believe we are dependent on any single patent, trademark, trade name, brand name or group of patents or trademarks, trade names or brand names. We intend to maintain the separate strengths and identities of our core brand names and product lines.
Environmental Matters and Regulation
We are subject to environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air, discharges of processed or other types of wastewater, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and the effects that they may have on us in the future are impossible to predict with accuracy. It is our policy to comply with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and we believe that any expense or liability we may incur in connection with any noncompliance with any law or regulation or the cleanup of any of our properties will not have a materially adverse effect on us. 
The engines manufactured by our AGCO Power engine division, which specializes in the manufacturing of non-road engines in the 75 to 600 horsepower range, currently comply with emissions standards and related requirements set by European, Brazilian and U.S. regulatory authorities, including both the United States Environmental Protection Agency and various state authorities. We expect to meet future emissions requirements through the introduction of new technology to our engines and exhaust after-treatment systems, as necessary. In some markets (such as the United States), we must obtain 
 4

governmental environmental approvals in order to import our products, and these approvals can be difficult or time-consuming to obtain or may not be obtainable at all. For example, our AGCO Power engine division and our engine suppliers are subject to air quality standards, and production at our facilities could be impaired if AGCO Power and these suppliers are unable to timely respond to any changes in environmental laws and regulations affecting engine emissions, including the emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHG"). Compliance with environmental and safety regulations has added, and will continue to add, to the cost of our products and increase the capital-intensive nature of our business.
Climate change, as a result of emissions of GHG, is a significant topic of discussion and may generate U.S. and other regulatory responses. It is impracticable to predict with any certainty the impact on our business of climate change or the regulatory responses to it, although we recognize that they could be significant. The most direct impacts are likely to be an increase in energy costs, which would increase our operating costs (through increased utility and transportation costs) and an increase in the costs of the products we purchase from others. In addition, increased energy costs for our customers could impact demand for our equipment. It is too soon for us to predict with any certainty the ultimate impact of additional regulation, either directionally or quantitatively, on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition.
Regulation and Government Policy
Domestic and foreign political developments and government regulations and policies directly affect the agricultural industry and indirectly affect the agricultural equipment business in the United States and abroad. The application, modification or adoption of laws, regulations or policies could have an adverse effect on our business.
We have manufacturing facilities or other physical presence in approximately 32 countries and sell our products in approximately 140 countries. This subjects us to a range of trade, product, foreign exchange, employment, tax and other laws and regulations, in addition to the environmental regulations discussed previously, in a significant number of jurisdictions. Many jurisdictions and a variety of laws regulate the contractual relationships with our dealers. These laws impose substantive standards on the relationships between us and our dealers, including events of default, grounds for termination, non-renewal of dealer contracts and equipment repurchase requirements. Such laws could adversely affect our ability to terminate our dealers.
In addition, each of the jurisdictions within which we operate or sell products has an important interest in the success of its agricultural industry and the consistency of the availability of reasonably priced food sources. These interests result in active political involvement in the agricultural industry, which, in turn, can impact our business in a variety of ways.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 21,200 employees, including approximately 4,700 employees in the United States and Canada. A majority of our employees at our manufacturing facilities, both domestic and international, are represented by collective bargaining agreements and union contracts with terms that expire on varying dates. We currently do not expect any significant difficulties in renewing these agreements.
