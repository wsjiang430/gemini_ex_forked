     Overview
     We are a cloud-based provider of payroll and human capital management, or HCM, software solutions for medium-sized organizations, which we define as those having between 20 and 1,000 employees. Our comprehensive and easy-to-use solutions enable our clients to manage their workforces more effectively. Excluding clients acquired as part of the BeneFLEX acquisition, as of June 30, 2019, we provided our payroll and HCM software solutions to approximately 20,200 clients across the U.S., which on average had over 100 employees. 
     Our multi-tenant software platform is highly configurable and includes a unified suite of payroll and HCM modules, including core HR, workforce management, talent and benefits, for our clients to make strategic decisions all while promoting a modern workplace and improving employee engagement. Our payroll and HCM modules provide robust on-demand functionality, reporting and analytics. Our platform provides intuitive self-service functionality for employees and managers combined with seamless integration across all our solutions. We supplement our comprehensive software platform with an integrated implementation and client service organization, all of which are designed to meet the needs of medium-sized organizations.
     Effective management of human capital is a core function in all organizations and requires a significant commitment of resources. Organizations are faced with complex and ever-changing requirements, including diverse federal, state and local regulations across multiple jurisdictions. In addition, the workplace operating environment is rapidly changing as employees increasingly become mobile, work remotely and expect an end user experience similar to
 that of consumer-oriented Internet applications. Medium-sized organizations operating without the infrastructure, expertise or personnel of larger enterprises are uniquely pressured in this complex and dynamic environment. Existing solutions offered by third-party payroll service providers can have limited capabilities and configurability while

enterprise-focused software vendors can be expensive and time-consuming to implement and manage. We believe that medium-sized organizations are better served by solutions designed to meet their unique needs.
     Our solutions provide the following key benefits to our clients:

      We market and sell our products through our direct sales force. We generate sales leads through a variety of focused marketing initiatives and from our extensive referral network of 401(k) advisors, benefits administrators, insurance brokers, third-party administrators and HR consultants. We derive revenue from a client based on the solutions purchased by the client, the number of client employees and the amount, type and timing of services provided with respect to those client employees. Our annual revenue retention rate was greater than 92% in each of the fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019. Our total revenues increased from $300.0 million in fiscal 2017 to $377.5 million in fiscal 2018, representing a 26% year-over-year increase and to $467.6 million in fiscal 2019, representing a 24% year-over-year increase.  Our recurring revenues increased from $288.4 million in fiscal 2017 to $363.5 million in fiscal 2018, representing a 26% year-over-year increase, and to $456.8 million in fiscal 2019, representing a 26% year-over-year increase. While the majority of our agreements with clients are generally cancellable on 60 days’ or less notice, we also began entering into term agreements in fiscal 2018, which are generally two years in length.  Our recurring revenue model provides significant visibility into our future operating results.
     Industry Background
     Effective management of human capital is a core capability for all organizations. Identifying, acquiring and retaining talent is a priority at all levels of an organization. Likewise, in today’s increasingly complex business and regulatory environment, organizations are being pressured to manage critical payroll and HCM functions more effectively, automate manual processes and decrease their operating costs, while at the same time successfully managing their workforces.     Complex and Dynamic Tax and Regulatory Environment
     The tax and regulatory environment in the United States is complex and dynamic. Organizations are subject to a myriad of benefit, workers compensation, healthcare, tax and other rules, regulations and reporting obligations. In addition to U.S. federal taxing and regulatory authorities, there are more than 10,000 state and local tax codes in the United States. Further, federal, state and local government agencies continually enact and amend the rules, regulations and reporting requirements with which organizations must comply. Leveraging industry leading technology and service to meet these demands delivers critical value to organizations.     Growing Demand for Mobility and Enhanced User Experience
     Connectivity and mobility are enabling employees to spend less time in traditional office environments and more time working remotely. This trend increases the demand for advanced and intuitive solutions that improve collaboration and foster employee engagement, such as remote self-service access to payroll and timesheet reporting, HR

and benefits portals and other talent management applications. Given the prominence of consumer-oriented Internet applications, employees expect the user experience and accessibility of internal systems to be similar to those of the latest Internet applications, such as LinkedIn, Amazon and Facebook.
     Large Market Opportunity for Payroll and HCM Solutions
     The market opportunity in the U.S. for payroll and HCM applications and services is driven by the importance of payroll and HCM solutions to the successful management of organizations. To estimate our addressable market, we focus our analysis on the number of U.S. medium-sized organizations and the number of their employees. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were over 638,000 firms with 20 to 999 employees in the U.S. in 2016, employing over 45 million people. We estimate that if clients were to buy our entire suite of existing solutions at list prices, they would spend approximately $400 per employee annually. Based on this analysis, we believe our current target addressable market is approximately $18 billion. Our existing clients do not typically own our entire suite of solutions, and as we continue to expand our product offerings, we believe that we have an opportunity to increase the amount clients spend on payroll and HCM solutions per employee and to expand our addressable market.     Organizations Are Increasingly Transitioning to SaaS Solutions
     SaaS solutions are easier and more affordable to implement and operate than those offered by traditional service bureaus and legacy software providers. SaaS solutions also enable software updates with greater frequency and without new hardware investments, enabling organizations to better react to changes in their environments. Many organizations are transitioning to SaaS solutions to satisfy their software needs. Similarly, we believe organizations are adopting SaaS applications for payroll and HCM solutions with increasing frequency.      Limitations of Legacy Competitive Solutions
     We believe that legacy payroll and HCM solution providers have limitations that cause them to underserve the unique needs of medium-sized organizations. Existing legacy payroll and HCM solutions include:
· | Traditional Payroll Service Providers. Traditional payroll service providers are primarily focused on delivery of a variety of payroll processing services, insurance products and HR business process outsourcing solutions. Many of these solutions offer limited capabilities and integration beyond traditional payroll processing. The lack of a unified and configurable employee-facing payroll and HCM suite can diminish the effectiveness of a system, detract from user experience and limit integration with other solutions. In addition, we believe that certain traditional payroll service providers often do not provide a high-quality technology and service experience.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enterprise-Focused Payroll and HCM Software Vendors. Enterprise-focused software vendors offer solutions and services that are designed for the complex needs and structures of very large enterprises. As a result, their solutions can be expensive, complex and time-consuming to implement, operate and maintain.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | HCM Point Solution Providers. Many HCM point solutions lack integrated payroll functionality. The implementation and management of multiple point solutions and the reliance on multiple service organizations can be challenging and expensive for medium-sized organizations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Manual Processes for Payroll and HCM Functions. Manual payroll and HCM processes require increased HR, payroll and finance personnel involvement, resulting in higher costs, slower processing and greater risks of data entry errors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Given the challenges medium-sized organizations face operating in complex and dynamic environments and the limited ability of traditional offerings to address these challenges, we believe there is a significant market opportunity for a comprehensive, unified SaaS solution designed to serve the payroll and HCM needs of medium-sized organizations.

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Seamless Integration with Extensive Ecosystem of Partners. Our platform offers our clients automated data integration with over 300 related third-party partner systems, such as 401(k), benefits and insurance provider systems. This integration reduces the complexity and risk of error of manual data transfers and saves time for our clients and their employees. We integrate data with these related systems through a secure connection, which significantly decreases the risk of unauthorized third-party access and other security breaches. Our direct and automated data transmission improves the accuracy of data and facilitates data collection in our partners’ systems. We believe having automated data integration with a payroll and HCM provider like us differentiates our partners’ product offerings, strengthening their competitive positioning in their own markets.

 Our Strategy
     We intend to strengthen and extend our position as a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and HCM software solutions to medium-sized organizations. Key elements of our strategy include:
· | Grow Our Client Base. We believe that our current client base represents only a small portion of the medium-sized organizations that could benefit from our solutions. While we provide our payroll and HCM software solutions to approximately 20,200 clients across the U.S. (excluding clients acquired as part of the BeneFLEX acquisition) as of June 30, 2019, there are over 638,000 businesses with 20 to 999 employees in the U.S., employing more than 45 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2016. In order to acquire new clients, we plan to continue growing our sales organization across the U.S. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand Our Product Offerings. We believe a significant part of our leadership position is the result of our investment and innovation in our product offerings designed for medium-sized organizations. Our average revenue per client has consistently increased in each of the last three years as we have broadened our product offerings. We plan to continue to invest in product development efforts that will allow us to offer a broader selection of products to new and existing clients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Extend Technological Leadership. We believe that our organically developed cloud-based multi-tenant software platform, combined with our unified database architecture, enhances the experience and usability of our products, providing what we believe to be a competitive advantage over alternative solutions. Our modern, intuitive user interface utilizes features found on many popular consumer Internet sites, enabling users to use our solutions with limited training. We plan to continue our technology innovation, as we have done with our mobile applications, social features and analytics capabilities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Further Develop Our Referral Network. We have developed a strong network of referral participants, such as 401(k) advisors, benefits administrators, insurance brokers, third-party administrators and HR consultants that recommend our solutions and provide referrals. We believe that our platform’s automated data integration with over 300 related third-party partner systems is valuable to our referral participants, as they are able to access payroll and HR data through a single system which decreases complexity and cost and complements their own product offerings. We plan to increase integration with third-party providers and expand our referral network to grow our client base and lower our client acquisition costs.

     Implementation and Client Services
     We supplement our comprehensive software platform with an integrated implementation and client service organization with deep subject matter expertise. Delivering clients a positive experience and a high level of support is an essential element of our ability to sell our solutions and retain clients.     Implementation and Training Services
     Our clients today are primarily medium-sized organizations that are typically migrating to our platform from a competitive solution or are adopting their first online payroll and HCM solution. These organizations often have limited internal resources and rely on us to implement their payroll and HCM solutions. We typically implement our product suite within only three to six weeks. Each client is guided through the implementation process by our knowledgeable consultants for all implementation matters. We believe our ability to rapidly implement our solutions is principally due to the combination of our emphasis on engagement with the client, our standardized methodology, our cloud-based architecture and our highly-configurable, easy-to-use products.
     We offer clients the opportunity to utilize on-demand or in-class training designed to provide clients with general knowledge on our solutions. We also host an annual client conference for clients to learn about new products and features and allow clients to provide feedback and learn best practices.

 Client Service
     Our client service model is designed to serve and support the needs of our clients and to build loyalty by developing strong relationships with clients. We strive to achieve high revenue retention, in part, by delivering high-quality service. Our revenue retention was greater than 92% in each of fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019. Each client is assigned an account management team that serves as the central point of contact for any questions or support needs. We believe this approach enhances client service by providing clients with knowledgeable resources who understand the client’s business, respond quickly, and are accountable for the overall client experience. Account managers are supplemented by teams with deep technical and subject matter expertise who help to expediently and effectively address client needs. We also proactively solicit client feedback through ongoing surveys from which we receive actionable feedback that we use to enhance our client service processes. We have also built an online knowledge repository for clients that provide industry content and Paylocity product and service information.     Tax and Regulatory Services
     Our software contains a rules engine designed to make accurate federal, state, and local tax calculations that is continually updated to support all pertinent legislative changes across U.S. jurisdictions. Our tax filing service provides a variety of solutions to clients including processing payroll tax deposits, preparing and filing quarterly and annual employment tax returns and amendments and resolving client employment tax notices.     Clients
     Excluding clients acquired as part of the BeneFLEX acquisition, as of June 30, 2019, we provided our payroll and HCM software solutions to approximately 20,200 clients, all located in the U.S. The rate at which we add clients is variable period-to-period and is also seasonal as many clients switch solutions during the first calendar quarter of each year. Clients include for-profit and non-profit organizations across industries including business services, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, restaurants, retail, technology and others. For each of the three years ended June 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019, no client accounted for more than 1% of our revenues.     Sales and Marketing
     We market and sell our products and services through our direct sales force. Our direct sales force includes sales representatives who have defined geographic territories throughout the U.S. We seek to hire experienced sales representatives wherever they are located and believe we have room to grow the number of sales representatives in each of our territories.
     The sales cycle begins with a sales lead generated by the sales representative, through our third-party referral network, a client referral, our telemarketing team, our external website, e-mail marketing, or other territory-based activities. We support our sales force with a marketing program that includes seminars and webinars, email marketing, social media marketing, broker events and web marketing. 
     Referral Network
     As a core element of our business strategy, we have developed a referral network of third-party service providers, including 401(k) advisors, benefits administrators, insurance brokers, third-party administrators and HR consultants, that recommend our solutions and provide referrals. Our referral network has become an increasingly important component of our sales process, and in fiscal 2019, more than 25% of our new client revenue originated by referrals from participants in our referral network.
     We believe participants in our referral network refer potential clients to us because of the strength of our products and services, the value we provide our referral partners through our broker portal, the fact that we do not provide services that compete with our referral networks, and because we offer third parties the ability to integrate their systems with our platform. Unlike other payroll and HCM solution providers who also provide retirement plans, health insurance and other products and services competitive with the offerings of the participants in our referral network, we

focus only on our core business of providing payroll and HCM solutions. In some cases, we have formalized relationships in which we are a recommended vendor of these participants. In other cases, relationships are informal. We typically do not compensate these participants for referrals.
     Partner Ecosystem
     We have developed a partner ecosystem of third-party systems, such as 401(k), benefits and insurance provider systems, with whom we provide automated data integration for their clients. These third-party providers require certain financial, payroll and other employee demographic information from their clients in order to efficiently provide their respective services. After securing authorization from the client, we exchange data with these providers. In turn, these third-party providers supply data to us, which allows us to deliver comprehensive HR and benefit management services to our clients. We believe our partnerships with these third parties are an important part of their service offerings. We have also developed our solutions to integrate with a variety of other systems used by our clients, such as accounting, point of sale, banking, expense management, recruiting, background screening and skills assessment solutions. 
     Paylocity’s automated data integration reduces the complexity and risk of error of manual data transfers and saves clients and employees time. Direct and automated data transmission improves the accuracy of data and facilitates data collection in partners’ systems. Having automated data integration with a payroll and HCM provider differentiates partners’ product offerings, strengthening their competitive positioning in their own markets.
     Technology
     We offer our solutions on a cloud-based platform that leverages a unified architecture and a common code base that we organically developed. Clients do not need to install our software in their data centers and can access our solutions through any mobile device or web browser with Internet access.
· | Multi-Tenant Architecture. Our software solutions were designed with a multi-tenant architecture. This architecture gives us an advantage over many disparate traditional systems, which are less flexible and require longer and more costly development and upgrade cycles. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Mobile Focused. We employ mobile-centric principles in our solution design and development. We believe that the increasing mobility of employees heightens the importance of access to our solutions through mobile devices, including smart phones and tablets. Our mobile experience provides our clients and their employees with access to our solutions through virtually any device having Internet access. We bring the flexibility of a secure, cloud-based solution to users without the need to access a traditional desktop or laptop computer. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Security. We maintain comprehensive security programs designed to ensure the security and integrity of client and employee data, protect against security threats or data breaches and prevent unauthorized access. We regulate and limit all access to servers and networks at our data centers. Our systems are monitored for irregular or suspicious activity, and we have dedicated internal staff perform security assessments for each release. Our systems undergo regular penetration testing and source code reviews by an independent third-party security firm. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We host our solutions at a third-party facility in Illinois and utilize another third-party facility in Wisconsin for backup and disaster recovery. We supply the hardware infrastructure and are responsible for the ongoing maintenance of our equipment at all data center locations.
     Competition
     The market for payroll and HCM solutions is both fragmented and highly competitive. Our competitors vary for each of our solutions and primarily include payroll and HR service and software providers, such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Paychex, Inc., Paycom Software, Inc., Paycor, Inc., Ultimate Software Group, Inc. and other local and regional providers.

     We believe the principal competitive factors on which we compete in our market include the following:
    
· | Focus on medium-sized organizations;
--+-------------------------------------


· | Breadth and depth of product functionality;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | Configurability and ease of use of our solutions;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | Modern, intuitive user experience;
--+-----------------------------------


· | Benefits of a cloud-based technology platform;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | Ability to innovate and respond to client needs rapidly;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | Domain expertise in payroll and HCM;
--+-------------------------------------


· | Quality of implementation and client service;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | Ease of implementation;
--+------------------------


· | Real-time web-based payroll processing; and
--+--------------------------------------------


· | Access to a wide variety of complementary third-party service providers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We believe that we compete favorably on these factors within the medium-sized organization market. We believe our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on the success of our continued investment in sales and marketing, research and development and implementation and client services.
     Research and Development
     We invest heavily in research and development to continuously introduce new modules, technologies, features and functionality. We are organized in small product-centric teams that utilize an agile development methodology. We focus our efforts on developing new modules and core technologies and on further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of existing modules.
     Research and development costs, including research and development costs that were capitalized, were $44.5 million, $55.7 million and $73.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Our research and development personnel are principally located at our headquarters, although we seek to hire highly experienced personnel wherever they are located.
     Intellectual Property
     Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Although we rely on laws respecting intellectual property rights, including trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality and frequent enhancements to our modules are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.

 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate our rights or to copy or obtain and use our proprietary technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our modules. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is very difficult.
     We expect that providers of payroll and HCM solutions such as ours may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the market and the number of competitors grows, and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these or other third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
     Employees
     As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately 3,050 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a union or are a party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We believe we have good relations with our employees and that our employee-focused culture benefits our clients and supports our growth. Our management team has remained committed to maintaining and improving our culture even as we grow rapidly, which is evidenced by our consistent receipt of top rankings from our employees as a great place to work in all of our office locations.
