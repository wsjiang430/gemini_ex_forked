Overview
 We are a wearable medical robotics company that offers mobility for those suffering from neuromuscular disorders and upper limb paralysis. We develop and market the MyoPro product line. A MyoPro is a myoelectric-controlled upper limb brace, or orthosis. The orthosis is a rigid brace used for the purpose of supporting a patient’s weak or deformed arm to enable and improve functional activities of daily living, ADLs, in the home and community. It is custom constructed by qualified orthotics and prosthetics, or O&P, professionals during a custom fabrication process for each individual user to meet their specific needs. Our products are designed to help restore function in individuals with neuromuscular conditions due to brachial plexus injury, stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury and other neurological disorders. We sell our products through orthotics and prosthetics, or O&P providers, the Veterans Health Administration, or VA, and to our distributor in certain accounts and geographic markets, OttoBock SE & Co. KGaA, or Ottobock. Recently, we have begun providing devices directly to patients and billing their insurance companies directly, and we primarily utilize the clinical services of trained professionals for which they are paid a fee.
 Our goal is to address the need to restore function to individuals who have suffered partial paralysis and can no longer support or move their arm or hand despite the best efforts of surgeons and rehabilitation therapists.
 1


Our solution, the MyoPro custom fabricated limb orthosis, is for the upper limbs. It was originally pioneered in the 1960s, recently refined in the labs of MIT, and made commercially feasible through our efforts. Partial paralysis is severe muscle weakness or loss of voluntary movement in one or more parts of the body. The MyoPro is registered with the FDA as a Class II device (Biofeedback Device). We believe it is the only current device able to help neuromuscular-impaired people restore function in weak arms and hands using their own muscle signals. The device consists of a portable arm brace made of a lightweight aerospace metal and includes advanced signal processing software, non-invasive sensors, and a lightweight battery unit. The product is worn to support the dysfunctional joint and as a functional aid for reaching and grasping but has also been shown to have therapeutic benefits for some users to increase motor control.
 The MyoPro’s control technology utilizes an advanced non-invasive human-machine interface based on non-invasive, patented electromyography, or EMG, control technology that continuously monitors and senses, but does not stimulate, the affected muscles. The patient self-initiates movement through his or her weakened muscle signals that indicate the intention to move. In addition to supporting the weakened limb, the MyoPro functions as a neuro-muscular prosthetic by restoring function to the impaired limb similar to a myoelectric prosthetic for an amputee. It is prescribed by physicians and provided by medical professionals certified to fit orthotics and prosthetics as a custom fabricated myoelectric elbow-wrist-hand orthosis.
 In addition to applications for stroke patients, we believe our technology may be used to increase upper extremity movement affected by diagnoses such as peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury, other neurological disorders, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy and traumatic brain injury.
 Our strategy is to establish ourselves as the market leader in myoelectric limb orthotics, and to build a set of products, software applications, and value-added services based upon our patented technology platform. While we currently focus on upper extremity orthotics, our future products may include devices for the shoulder, leg, knee, and ankle, sized for both adults, adolescents and children, along with non-medical applications for industrial and military markets. We expect to introduce our MyPro device for pediatric use in 2019.
 We estimate that the addressable market for products directed to patients with upper extremity paralysis, such as our MyoPro, may total $10.0 billion, based on 3.0 million existing cases of upper extremity paralysis and our estimate that 25% of such individuals may be medically qualified candidates for a MyoPro.  In addition, based on an estimated 350,000 new cases each year, we believe this market is expected to grow by $1.2 billion per year.  Using similar estimates for countries outside of the United States, we believe that the total worldwide market potential for products addressing upper extremity paralysis may reach $30.0 billion.
 We utilize patient screening days to identify potential patients that could be fitted with our MyoPro device.  During 2018, we organized over 200 screening days across the United States, after test marketing this approach with O&P channel partners earlier in the year.
 Among private insurance companies, reimbursement amounts for our MyoPro devices currently range for $20,000 to $60,000 per unit, depending on the MyoPro model. The selling price of our MyoPro devices to our channel partners range from $10,000 to $25,000 per unit depending on the MyoPro model. In November the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued two new codes for the MyoPro, L8701 and L8702, and we expect decisions relating to coverage policy determination and reimbursement amounts for our MyoPro products from CMS in the first half of 2019, which may offer greater access to the MyoPro for Medicare beneficiaries. However, there is no specified timetable for such a CMS decision, nor is there any guarantee that any such decisions will actually increase access. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of any such decision on the amounts that we may be reimbursed by private insurance companies, if any.
 We are the exclusive licensee of U.S. patents for the myoelectric limb orthosis device based on technology originally developed at MIT in collaboration with medical experts affiliated with Harvard Medical School. We have licensed 2 patents across 1 patent family to protect our technology. We also hold 10 issued patents in the U.S. and various countries and have 2 pending patent applications. Our devices are currently referred for patients at leading rehabilitation facilities, including, among others, the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and VA hospitals across the country.

 Market Opportunity: Common Causes of Arm Paralysis
 Stroke
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC, stroke is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. affecting 800,000 people per year. We have working relationships with rehabilitation facilities in the U.S., including the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Kennedy Krieger Institute, and National Rehabilitation Hospital, and have developed an appropriate set of inclusion criteria to determine which persons that are affected by stroke would be medically qualified for the intervention.
 A growing diagnosis in the U.S. is the occurrence of stroke in those under the age of 65. Nationally, 34% of stroke survivors are under 65. The challenges for these younger survivors include the need to return to work, child rearing, and community activities that may not exist for older individuals. We believe that this is an important market segment because of their greater need to return to normal activity, and because they are more likely to have their devices reimbursed by insurance providers.
 Vehicular and Workplace Accidents
 One of the most straightforward applications for the MyoPro is to support the weak arm and restore arm function to individuals who have suffered peripheral nerve injuries. A common outcome of vehicular and workplace accidents is damage to the nerves in the shoulder known as the brachial plexus. Many individuals recover from their related trauma with the exception of the ability to control their elbow and in some cases their hand. Nerve transfer surgery is often a solution; however, these procedures are not always restorative. In some cases, patients undergo amputation and receive myoelectric prosthetics rather than deal with a paralyzed arm. One of the leading medical facilities in the U.S. for treating brachial plexus injuries is the Mayo Clinic. We have been working with surgeons at the Mayo Clinic who have incorporated the MyoPro into their surgical post-operative treatment protocol.
Spinal Cord Injuries
 According to the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, spinal cord injuries are the cause of 23% of all paralysis. The level of paralysis depends on where the injury occurs. Currently, medically qualified individuals include those with sufficient remaining EMG signal strength to initiate movement of the devices, as determined by the clinician using a MyoPro evaluation unit.
Cerebral Palsy
 Based on data provided by the CDC, the prevalence of cerebral palsy, or CP, in the United States is approximately 74,000 for children ages 6-12 years old. CP is caused by brain injury or brain malformation that occurs before, during, or immediately after birth while the infant’s brain is under development.
 Myomo has conducted initial product testing at the Easter Seals Clinic in the Chicago area and the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore to gauge efficacy of its myoelectric brace on children with CP. Based on this work, we have developed a prototype custom fabricated elbow brace for children ages 6-12 and intend to commercialize this product when product development and testing is completed, which we expect to occur over the next 12-18 months.
 Progressive Conditions
 The MyoPro has been prescribed in a few cases for individuals with progressive conditions such as multiple sclerosis and ALS. For individuals with these conditions, the MyoPro is used for strength conservation and to extend the time they can maintain independence. As users continue to progress with their condition, settings can be adjusted to provide increasing amounts of assistance.

Arm Paralysis Solutions & Treatments
 The standard of care for treating paralysis varies by diagnosis. In the case of neurological injuries such as stroke, occupational / physical therapy is the standard of care. Each year, stroke and other survivors undergo months of rehabilitation. Unfortunately, many result in long term hemiparesis, which is weakness on one side of the body. Interventions such as electrical stimulation, static braces, and continued therapy are available, and yet the prevalence of chronic upper limb paralysis is in the millions.
Our Solutions
 Although commercial products for powered prosthetics have been available since the 1970s, we believe that powered orthotics have been held back by issues related to weight and comfort. The MyoPro is known in the medical community as a custom fabricated limb orthosis. It is created individually for each patient from a cast, just like a prosthetic, except for someone who still has a limb but that is non-responsive.
 O&P devices are provided by medical professionals trained and certified to custom fabricate and fit these devices. According to the American Orthotics and Prosthetics Association, in 2012, there were approximately 3,000 O&P facilities located both separate from and within hospitals in the U.S. Additionally, the VA has been a pioneer in O&P. In fact, the design of the new MyoPro Motion G powered grasp product is rooted in research conducted at the Boston-area VA in the 1990s. This research demonstrated that it is technically feasible to design a myoelectric hand orthosis; however, we believe that the product was not commercially practical until Myomo was able to incorporate recent technological developments such as improved computer processors and software, lightweight materials, and smaller batteries to create an acceptable orthosis for users.
 The MyoPro can enable individuals to self-initiate and control movements of a partially paralyzed or weakened limb using their own muscle signals. When the user tries to move, sensors detect the weak muscle signal, which activates the motor to move the limb in the desired direction. The user is in control of their own limb; the brace amplifies their weak muscle signal to restore function to the affected joint. With the orthosis, a paralyzed individual, such as one who has suffered a brachial plexus injury, stroke or other neuromuscular disorder can perform ADLs including feeding, reaching and lifting.
 Patented EMG control technology continuously monitors and senses, but does not stimulate, the affected muscles. The user self-initiates and achieves natural movement patterns by their own muscular signals that indicate intention to move. The system senses an EMG muscle signal and then processes data to a motor on the device that enables desired motion. Importantly, the EMG-driven device requires that users are actively engaged throughout the movement; if they stop, the device stops.
 Clinicians who evaluate and fit a patient for a MyoPro require education, training, and experience to complete such tasks. In order to qualify for a MyoPro, candidates must meet a comprehensive set of requirements determined by a trained clinical professional during an evaluation. These criteria include long term partial paralysis, detection of a muscle signal sufficient to control the device, demonstrate cognitive abilities, meeting certain parameters for height and weight, lack of other conditions that might limit the effectiveness or safety of the device such as use of certain pharmaceuticals, high levels of pain, or limits to range of motion, as well as falling within measurement limitations for the arm and hand to be able to fit into the device. Finally, candidates must have meaningful and achievable functional goals that can realistically be accomplished with the device that cannot otherwise be achieved with a less costly intervention such as additional rehabilitation therapy.
 Each MyoPro brace is custom fabricated to the patient by a certified O&P practitioner for optimum mobility and performance. During the evaluation process, a certified orthotist or prosthetist will qualify an individual for a MyoPro through a physical assessment. Should the individual qualify, the provider will determine whether the device is covered by the individual’s health insurance. If coverage is in effect and the individual is a suitable candidate for MyoPro, the O&P center will initiate the fabrication and fitting process:
  
• | First an impression plaster molding of the patient’s arm will be taken. This mold is sent off to a central fabrication facility for custom brace fabrication.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Fabrication typically takes 2-4 weeks. Once the brace is received by the O&P practice, the patient will be brought back for a fitting. During this fitting, the device will be calibrated to the user’s individual muscle signal profile and minor adjustments to the brace can be made to optimize comfort.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The user will be provided with initial training and a set of take home tasks to practice with the brace donned. Research studies have shown that O&P users do better when they receive additional training on how to best use their accommodation device. Follow up training may take place at a MyoPro certified therapy or rehabilitation center or at the O&P practice.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In a cost conscious healthcare environment, we believe that there are two compelling uses for the MyoPro. The first is to enable users to return to work, whether they are young mothers raising children, engineers and technicians working at their vocation, or electricians and mechanics using both arms to accomplish their work.
 The second key application is keeping individuals who have difficulty performing ADLs to live safely at home. In the U.S., 5% of community residents require daily help with ADLs and consume 23% of all healthcare spending. We believe that restoring upper limb function to these individuals may result in fewer emergency room visits related to falls, increase their level of activity, and avoid the need for institutionalization. With 70 million Baby Boomers headed into their retirement years, we believe that it is vital to keep beneficiaries in the lowest cost of care setting — the home.
 Health Insurance Reimbursement
 The standard process for a new medical device to gain reimbursement begins with the FDA. The device must be classified and, depending on the level of risk, registered as a Class I or Class II low risk device not requiring pre-market notification, cleared via 510(K) for a Class II medium risk device, or approved through a PMA process for Class III high risk devices. The device is registered with the FDA and indications for use as well as contra-indications are defined. Once FDA regulatory work is completed, it is necessary to identify the applicable reimbursement code and benefit category.
 Companies marketing medical devices that fit into existing codes are able to submit an application and sample to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, Working Workgroup for device reimbursement and gain confirmation that it can be billed using that an existing code or be advised that another a new code is to be used established for coverage and classification. Devices that do not fit into an existing device code must establish sufficient operating volume, as determined by the CMS Working group, to justify a Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, or, HCPCS code and submit an application showing that it meets the evidence requirements for “medical necessity” based on claims & reimbursement policy (Chapter 13 of the Medicare Program Integrity Manual for Reasonable and Necessary). During the interim period between regulatory registration and a new code, there is a process enabling providers to bill for the medical device using a general purpose or Not Otherwise Classified, or NOC, code that results in the case by case review of claims by payers. When a new code is assigned, it is often accompanied by a reimbursement coverage policy associated with the device as well as a fee schedule for Medicare reimbursement by state.
 In terms of reimbursement, contractors for CMS have previously issued erroneous coding guidance suggesting that the MyoPro should be provided on a rental basis to standard, part B Medicare beneficiaries using the code E1399. In response to an application we filed in December 2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued two new codes describing different versions of the MyoPro. We expect decisions relating to coverage policy determination and allowable reimbursement amounts for our MyoPro products from CMS in the first half of 2019, which may offer greater access to the MyPro for Medicare beneficiaries. However, there is no specified timetable for such a CMS decision, nor is there any guarantee that any such decisions will actually increase access. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of any such decision on the amounts, if any, that we may be reimbursed by private insurance companies.

Currently, we set the price to distributors for our products. A distributor will only be willing to order a product from us if the level of reimbursement from third party payers is sufficient to provide a reasonable profit to the distributor after paying our price. The process of obtaining reimbursement is handled entirely by the distributor with clinical support from us in some cases. Historically, the reimbursement level has generally been sufficient to lead to sales providing reasonable gross margins to us. However, there can be no assurance that future reimbursement levels will continue to provide acceptable gross margins to us.
 We sell our products directly as well as indirectly through our distributors to the VA. In direct sales, we provide a quote for our products, and if accepted, the VA issues a purchase order directly to us. Indirect sales generally are handled in the same manner as other sales of our products to distributors.
 We believe the receipt of a HCPCS code could expand the pool of potential users of our products because Medicare eligible patients would have greater access to our products, especially those patients who are not able to afford our products without Medicare reimbursement. To our knowledge, as of December 31, 2018, fewer than ten units have been self-paid or funded by non-profit foundations. As described above, the process of obtaining a HCPCS code is long and often requires clinical experience to validate the need for a new code specific to the MyoPro. We cannot make any assurance that a HCPCS code will be issued or that the amount of reimbursement offered will be sufficient to provide a reasonable profit to us or to our distributors.
 Research and Development
 We are committed to investing in a robust product development program and to supporting a variety of clinical research studies to enhance our products, increase the body of evidence to support prescribing and reimbursing our devices, and to grow our range of product offerings. Our R&D team is comprised of eight engineers with a mix of BS, MS and PhD degrees in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering and computer science and augmented by outside resources as needed. The R&D team seeks to combine innovative research conducted over the last 50 years with cutting edge innovations in robotics, machine learning, and material science to continue to enhance our products and product offerings. Our regulatory, clinical, and customer service personnel work closely with our suppliers and providers to promote compliance with quality standards and good manufacturing processes, which we believe result in a high-quality product and limited customer issues.
 We plan, depending on available resources, to increase our investment in research, development, and customer service in the future in order to continually improve our system architecture and develop new product innovations that increase the value and breadth of our product offerings. Additional product enhancements in the future may be focused on incremental offerings for individual body parts such as the shoulder, wrist, leg and ankle, along with more compact and lighter weight components more appropriate for the needs of children, along with potential non-medical applications for industrial and military markets.
 Clinical Research Studies
 Evidence of efficacy involving myoelectric orthotics dates back to 1967. We have partnered with leading researchers to study the impact of its technology to restore function to a paralyzed joint as well as the real world benefit that comes from being able to independently perform ADLs in the home, vocational tasks at work, and community activities such as shopping. A study was published in January 2017 that demonstrated the instantaneous reduction in upper limb impairment and increase in ability to complete functional tasks for chronic stroke patients. In addition to the previous published research, Myomo also has an active grant-funded research program. Currently funded studies include a study of the MyoPro device for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) induced arm impairment with the Cleveland VA and Northwestern University and a recently-funded study of the device for patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) at Kessler Rehabilitation Center in New Jersey. The preliminary results from the TBI study are very promising and have been presented at research conferences. We anticipate the first paper from this study to be published in 2019. These studies focused on the ability of MyoPro users to initiate movement of their affected limbs and perform ADLs such as picking up objects so that they may feed themselves and live more independently. In addition to the studies Myomo is directly involved in, various clinical facilities are undertaking their own research projects on the outcomes of MyoPro users.

Sales and Marketing
 Our strategic goal is to develop and commercialize products that become the standard of care for individuals with paralysis who cannot be successfully treated with less costly interventions such as rehabilitation therapy. Our strategy is to establish ourselves as a market leader in myoelectric-controlled orthotics by building a set of products, software applications, and value-added services based upon our patented technology platform. We recently introduced the first powered grasp orthosis for the hand and anticipate that our future products may include devices for the shoulder, leg, knee, and ankle, sized for both adults and children, along with potential non-medical applications for industrial and military markets. After developing a larger base of operations in the U.S., we plan to expand into international markets via local and global partnerships and distribution arrangements to meet the large global need that we believe exists for individuals with paralysis.
 Our current commercialization model includes a direct sales force targeting hospitals and O&P practices that provide our products to their patients as well as indirect sales through distributors. To date, we have had insignificant sales overseas. The MyoPro product line has been approved by the VA system for impaired veterans, and over thirty VA facilities have already ordered devices for their patients. In January 2017, we entered into an agreement with Ottobock, a global leader in the field of O&P devices, to market the MyoPro product line in the U.S., followed by Canada and certain EU countries upon receiving regulatory approval. We plan to expand our direct sales force and other distribution agreements to increase our penetration into these markets.
 Of the 3,000 O&P clinical offices in the U.S., we expect to recruit and train professionals at select locations with proven experience working with sophisticated prosthetic products to provide MyoPro devices for their patients.  In response to an application we filed in December 2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued two new codes describing different versions of the MyoPro. We expect decisions relating to coverage policy determination and allowable reimbursement amounts for our MyoPro products from CMS in the first half of 2019, which may offer greater access to the MyPro for Medicare beneficiaries. However, there is no specified timetable for such a CMS decision, nor is there any guarantee that any such decisions will actually increase access. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of any such decision on the amounts, if any, that we may be reimbursed by private insurance companies.
 To bring the MyoPro to what we believe is the large number of potential patients outside of the U.S., we have begun discussions with regional companies that have established distribution channels in these markets and entered into an agreement with Ottobock for distribution in certain EU countries. In July 2017, we obtained CE Mark, which is a manufacturer’s declaration that the product complies with the essential requirements of the relevant European health, safety and environmental protection legislation for the MyoPro so that it can be marketed in Europe, and to seek regulatory approval via local partners in select other markets. In October 2017 we obtained our medical device license for Canada, enabling us to provide the MyoPro to patients in that country.
 We plan to increase our marketing and advertising expenditures to raise awareness and educate clinicians and patients about the MyoPro.
 Competition
 An individual with difficulty walking has a wide range of technology alternatives from canes and crutches to powered wheelchairs and exoskeleton suits. However, those with paralysis of the arm, wrist, and hand, whose physical challenges that we seek to address, have few options.
Rehabilitation Therapy
 Rehabilitation therapy is the standard of care for upper extremity paralysis and a prerequisite to qualifying for a myoelectric orthosis such as the MyoPro. After a stroke or other traumatic injury, a large portion of survivors are able to regain much or all of their function. However, every year there are many survivors whose upper extremities remain paralyzed despite best efforts of rehabilitation therapists.

Non-Powered Braces
 Some individuals are able to accomplish their functional goals with braces that are non-powered or use springs to offset forces of gravity or muscle tightness, referred to as spasticity. Medical professionals who evaluate patients for myoelectric orthotics screen out individuals who could accomplish their goals with a simpler, less costly intervention such as these braces.
 Experimental Surgery: Battelle — Brain Implants
 An array of experimental interventions currently is being researched at universities and non-profit research facilities around the world. One such innovation recently announced by Battelle Memorial Institute in Ohio involves a craniotomy, which is a surgical opening into the skull performed to implant a sensor chip in the brain. An electrical cable is connected to the top of the head connecting to a system that sends pulses of electrical stimulation to activate muscles in the forearm. The procedure is experimental, invasive, and costly, but may be offered as an alternative to a myoelectric orthosis.
Exoskeleton Suits
 During the last few years, a number of companies have emerged to provide exoskeleton suits that enable those with lower extremity paralysis to stand and walk again. Companies in this space include ReWalk, Ekso Bionics, and Cyberdyne. It is possible that companies may begin to compete with solutions such as ours for the upper extremity. Although we are not aware that any of these companies is currently considering upper extremity products, we can provide no assurance that they are not currently developing competing products.
Potential New Products from O&P Manufacturers
 If our business grows, interest may develop among existing manufacturers of other O&P devices that compete with the MyoPro, which may or may not challenge the validity of our intellectual property.
Intellectual Property
 The MyoPro is protected by two core patents exclusively licensed from MIT for the life of the patents. The first patent (U.S. Pat. No. 7,396,337) covers a powered orthotic device, worn over a patient’s elbow or other joint that senses relatively low-level muscle signals in the vicinity of the joint generated by a patient. In response to the relatively low level signals, the powered orthotic device moves, causing the patient’s body part to move about the joint accordingly with adjustable force and assistance settings. The patent expires on December 1, 2023. The second patent (U.S. Pat. No. 7,367,958) covers a method of providing rehabilitation movement training for a person suffering from nerve damage, stroke, spinal cord injury, neurological trauma or neuromuscular disorder by moving a body part about a joint using a powered orthotic device. The patent claims methods that include moving the body part about the joint in two directions based on an EMG signal from a muscle associated with that body part or moving the body part about the joint in one direction based on the EMG signal and in another direction based on a return force in the absence of a sensed EMG signal. This patent expires on November 21, 2023, which represents the earliest patent expiration among Myomo’s intellectual property portfolio.
 The two patent licenses discussed above were granted pursuant to a certain exclusive licensing agreement, as amended, or the License Agreement. Under the License Agreement, we have been granted access to those certain patent rights in exchange for the payment of royalties, which vary based on the level of our net sales. As part of the License Agreement, we must pay a nonrefundable annual license maintenance fee which may be credited to any royalty amounts due in that same year. The License Agreement can be terminated if certain sales targets are not achieved.

The future minimum amounts due under this agreement for the next five years are as follows:
 
 
2019 | $ | 25,000
-------------------------+---+-------
2020 | | 25,000
2021 | | 25,000
2022 | | 25,000
2023 year patents expire | | 25,000

 
Under the Licensing Agreement, we issued 6,172 shares of our common stock to MIT. They have the right to purchase additional shares of our common stock to maintain their pro rata ownership.
 On November 15, 2016, we entered into a waiver agreement with MIT with regard to certain obligations, or the Obligations Waiver, under the License Agreement. The Obligations Waiver contemplates that we have not met certain revenue obligations, or the Revenue Obligations, and certain commercialization obligations, or the Commercial Obligations, which are required under the License Agreement. Pursuant to the Revenue Obligations, we were originally obligated to have net sales of at least $200,000, $250,000, $500,000 and $750,000 in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 (and each year thereafter), respectively. Pursuant to the Commercialization Obligations, we were originally obligated to introduce a home version of a “licensed product” on or before December 31, 2010, expand distribution of a licensed product to 10 major metropolitan areas on or before December 31, 2011 and expand distribution to at least one country outside of the United States on or before December 31, 2012. The Obligations Waiver waives any and all Revenue Obligations up to the date of the waiver agreement and waives the Commercialization Obligations up to and through the date of the waiver agreement. The Obligations Waiver cannot be terminated by any other parties.
 Myomo has its own issued patents as well. In January 2013, Myomo’s patent entitled Powered Orthotic Device was granted in Europe (European Patent No. 2079361), which is validated (currently in force) in six European countries. In June 2014, a substantially similar patent was granted in Japan (Japanese Patent No. 5557529). In November 2013 and January 2015, Myomo’s two U.S. patents issued entitled Powered Orthotic Device and Method of Using Same (U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,585,620 and 8,926,534, respectively). On July 26, 2016, Myomo’s third U.S. patent was issued (U.S. Pat. No. 9,398,994).
 In terms of trademarks, the terms Myomo and MyoPro are registered as trademarks with the US Patent & Trademark Office. Within the first ten years from the registration dates shown above, we will be required to complete two (2) “maintenance” filings, one between the 5th and 6th years and the second between the 9th and 10th years. Each successive 10 year period thereafter we will be required to complete a “maintenance” filing between every 9th and 10th year. Our trademarks were registered in 2013 and 2014.
 Government Regulation
 The MyoPro device and our operations including our supply chain and distribution channels are subject to regulation by the FDA and various other U.S. federal and state agencies. We are also subject to regulation by foreign governmental agencies in connection with international sales. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of our medical device products. These agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us, such as product recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions.
 Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or, FFDCA, medical devices are classified as Class I, Class II or Class III, depending on the degree of risk and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. As the FDA is now giving more attention to the differentiated performance of myoelectric controlled orthotics, we elected to change our classification registration to Class II for the MyoPro 2 family of products. These are generally low risk devices for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by safety and testing adherence to a set of guidelines, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials.

We, together with Cogmedix, actively maintain FDA 21 CFR Part 820 QSR and ISO 13485 Quality Management Systems for product design, manufacturing, distribution, and customer feedback processes. Following the introduction of a product, the FDA and foreign agencies engage in periodic reviews of our quality systems, the product performance, and the advertising and promotional materials. These regulatory controls, as well as any changes in FDA policies, can affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction and continued availability of new products. We work to anticipate these factors in our product development processes.
 Manufacturing
 Myomo’s custom fabricated orthosis is comprised of two elements. The first is the electromechanical kit. The kit consists of the motor units, processor, sensors, and battery. Manufacturing for the electromechanical kit is provided by our supplier Cogmedix, a wholly owned subsidiary of Coughlin Companies in Worcester, MA. The second element is the custom fabrication of the orthosis itself from a model of the patient’s arm. Custom fabrication is provided by GRE, privately owned by Jonathan Naft, an executive of Myomo. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”
 If the volume and geographic reach of our sales expand, we may seek additional sources for manufacturing and custom fabrication of the devices as our needs may require.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed a total of 45 full time and 1 part time employees.
