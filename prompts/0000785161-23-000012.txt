Item 1.Business 
Overview of the Company
General
We are a national leader in post-acute healthcare services and the nation’s largest owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in terms of patients treated, revenues, and number of hospitals. We provide specialized rehabilitative treatment on an inpatient basis. We operate hospitals in 36 states and Puerto Rico, with concentrations in the eastern half of the United States and Texas. As of December 31, 2022, we operate 153 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. We are committed to delivering high-quality, cost-effective, integrated patient care.
 Effective January 1, 2018, we changed our corporate name from HealthSouth Corporation to Encompass Health Corporation and the NYSE ticker symbol for our common stock from “HLS” to “EHC.” Our principal executive offices are located at 9001 Liberty Parkway, Birmingham, Alabama 35242, and the telephone number of the principal executive offices is (205) 967-7116. Our website address is www.encompasshealth.com.
On July 1, 2022, we completed the previously announced separation of our home health and hospice business through the distribution (the “Spin Off”) of all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Enhabit, Inc. (“Enhabit”) to the stockholders of record of Encompass Health as of the close of business on June 24, 2022 (the “Record Date”). The Spin Off was effective at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on July 1, 2022. The Spin Off was structured as a pro rata distribution of one share of Enhabit common stock for every two shares of Encompass Health common stock held of record as of the Record Date. No fractional shares were distributed. A cash payment was made in lieu of any fractional shares. As a result of the Spin Off, Enhabit is now an independent public company and its common stock is listed under the symbol “EHAB” on the New York Stock Exchange.
In addition to the discussion here, we encourage the reader to review Item 1A, Risk Factors, Item 2, Properties, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which highlight additional considerations about our company.

Our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals offer specialized rehabilitative care across an array of diagnoses and deliver comprehensive, high-quality, cost-effective patient care services. As participants in the Medicare program, our hospitals must be licensed and certified and otherwise comply with various requirements that are discussed below in the “Sources of Revenues—Medicare Reimbursement” section. Substantially all (91%) of the patients we serve are admitted from acute-care hospitals following physician referrals for specific acute inpatient rehabilitative care. Most of those patients have experienced significant physical or cognitive disabilities or injuries due to medical conditions, such as strokes, hip fractures, and a variety of debilitating neurological conditions, that are generally nondiscretionary in nature and require rehabilitative healthcare services in a facility-based setting. During the COVID-19 Pandemic (the “pandemic”), our hospitals treated thousands of patients with or recovering from the COVID-19 virus. Our focus on specialized rehabilitative care has meant that in many cases our hospitals have been ideal settings for treating the debilitating effects of the COVID-19 virus, such as significant muscle weakness, cognitive impairments, shortness of breath with activity, and malnutrition. Our teams of highly skilled nurses and physical, occupational, and speech therapists utilize proven technology and clinical protocols with the objective of restoring our patients’ 
physical and cognitive abilities. Patient care is provided by nursing and therapy staff as directed by physician orders while case managers monitor each patient’s progress and provide documentation and oversight of patient status, achievement of goals, discharge planning, and functional outcomes. Our hospitals provide a comprehensive interdisciplinary clinical approach to treatment that leverages innovative technologies and advanced therapies and leads to superior outcomes.
Competitive Strengths
We believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors based on, among other things, the quality of our clinical outcomes, our cost-effectiveness, our financial strength, and our extensive application of technology. We also believe our competitive strengths discussed below give us the ability to adapt and succeed in a healthcare industry facing regulatory uncertainty around attempts to improve outcomes and reduce costs.
•People. We believe our employees share a steadfast commitment to providing outstanding care to our patients. We undertake significant efforts to ensure our clinical and support staff receives the education and training necessary to provide the highest quality care in the most cost-effective manner. We also have hospital staff trained for all patient acuity levels faced in the post-acute setting. We embrace the Encompass Health Way, our core set of values developed through input from a broad cross section of our employees. The Encompass Health Way calls on each of our employees to set the standard, lead with empathy, do what’s right, focus on the positive, and ensure we are stronger together. We believe our award-winning culture is essential to attracting and retaining talent. For further discussion of our human capital management and our award-winning culture, see the section titled “Human Capital Management” below.
•Change Agility. We have a demonstrated ability to adapt in the face of numerous and significant regulatory, legislative, and operating environment changes. We believe our consistent and disciplined operating model allows us to be nimble and responsive to change. Examples of regulatory and other changes through which we have successfully managed include:
▪The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) adopted a rule, effective beginning in 2007, that conditioned the reimbursement rate for an inpatient rehabilitation facility, or “IRF,” on at least 60% of a facility’s patients having at least one of 13 qualifying medical conditions.
▪The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) enacted in 2010 instituted several mandatory Medicare payment reforms, including reimbursement reductions for IRFs, and created the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (“CMMI”) to develop, test, and promote innovative payment and delivery models.
▪The ACA created the IRF Quality Reporting Program. This program requires IRFs to report quality data, the elements of which are updated annually, and imposes a financial penalty for noncompliance.
▪The 2010 CMS reimbursement rule for IRFs implemented new IRF coverage requirements, or specifications as to what conditions must be met to qualify for reimbursement, that were effective for all Medicare discharges on or after January 1, 2010. Those IRF coverage requirements replaced coverage criteria that were in place for 25 years.
▪The Budget Control Act of 2011 implemented an automatic 2% reduction, or “sequestration,” of Medicare program payments for all healthcare providers beginning in 2013.
▪The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 directed CMS to promulgate rules requiring the collection and reporting of standardized patient assessment data across post-acute care providers.
▪In 2019, CMS replaced the long-standing patient assessment measure, a component of Medicare reimbursement, with new assessment measures requiring significant training and operational changes.
▪In October 2022, CMS significantly changed the extensive admission and discharge interdisciplinary data elements required to be collected in connection with Medicare reimbursement claims.
Additionally, the pandemic posed a number of challenges in the operating environment. We demonstrated our ability to change and remain resilient by implementing protocols for the safety of our employees and our patients while managing supply chain constraints, specifically with personal protective equipment, in a timely and effective manner. The formation of our COVID Task Force allowed us to centralize decision-making while 
empowering the hospitals to enact the protocols needed as the pandemic cycled through the country. Our therapy teams developed plans for COVID patients while maintaining our expected high-quality outcomes.
•Strategic Relationships. We have a long and successful history of building strategic relationships with major healthcare systems. More than a third of our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals currently operate as joint ventures with acute-care hospitals or systems. Joint ventures with market leading acute-care hospitals establish a solid foundation for providing integrated patient care that can improve the quality of outcomes and reduce the total cost of care.
Many patients continue to need nursing and therapy services after they leave the IRF setting to continue their recovery at home. Care collaboration between our hospitals and the home health agencies selected by our patients offers an excellent means to improve patient experience and outcomes and reduce the total cost of care across a post-acute episode.
The post-acute innovation tools we have developed, and will continue to develop, support our strategic relationship initiatives by enhancing the effective and efficient management of patients across multiple post-acute care settings and facilitating high-quality patient care, improved care coordination, and network provider performance and cost management.
Additionally, we have a strategic sponsorship with the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association on a nationwide basis to increase patient independence after a stroke and reduce stroke mortality through community outreach and information campaigns.
•Clinical Expertise and High-Quality Outcomes. We have extensive clinical experience from which we have developed standardized best practices and protocols. We believe these clinical best practices and protocols, particularly as leveraged with our well-trained clinicians and industry-leading technology, help ensure the delivery of consistently high-quality healthcare services, reduced inefficiencies, and improved performance across a spectrum of operational areas. Currently, we operate 131 hospitals that hold one or more Joint Commission Disease-Specific Care Certifications, such as stroke rehabilitation, hip fracture rehabilitation, brain injury rehabilitation, amputee rehabilitation, Parkinson’s Disease rehabilitation, and spinal cord injury rehabilitation certification. Our hospitals account for 61% of all stroke rehabilitation accreditations, 97% of hip fracture rehabilitation accreditations, and 78% of all brain injury rehabilitation accreditations.
•Cost Effectiveness. Our scale, data-driven business practices, consistent and disciplined operating model, and culture help us provide healthcare services on a cost-effective basis. We leverage centralized administrative functions, use data analytics to identify trends and respond on a timely basis, and identify best practices and implement them across our platform of hospitals. Our de novo and bed addition strategies incorporate pre-fabrication construction technology to create efficiencies by reducing reliance on subcontractors, improving supply chain efficiencies, providing a consistent construction quality and realizing a speed-to-market benefit.
•Financial Resources. We have a proven track record of generating strong cash flows from operations that have allowed us to successfully pursue our growth strategy, manage our financial leverage, and make complementary shareholder distributions. We did not accept any pandemic relief funds under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the “CARES Act”) or any other program or legislation. As of December 31, 2022, we have a strong, well-capitalized balance sheet, including ownership of approximately 76% of our hospital real estate, no significant debt maturities prior to 2025, and ample availability under our revolving credit facility, which along with the cash flows generated from operations should, we believe, provide sufficient support for our business strategy.
•Advanced Technology and Innovation. We are focused on developing technology-enabled strategies to further improve our effectiveness at providing integrated healthcare. Our post-acute innovation strategy is based on using our clinical expertise, our large post-acute datasets, and our proven capabilities in enterprise-level electronic medical record technologies, data analytics, data integration, and predictive analytics to drive value-based performance across the healthcare continuum for our patients, our partners, and our payors. We believe our information systems and post-acute innovation solutions, in addition to improving patient care and operating efficiencies, allow us to collect, analyze, and share information on a timely basis making us an ideal partner for other healthcare providers in a coordinated care delivery environment. Our systems also emphasize interoperability with referral sources and other providers coordinating care. We have devoted substantial resources, effort and expertise to leveraging technology to create post-acute solutions that improve patient care and operating efficiencies.
Patients and Demographic Trends
Demographic trends, such as population aging, should continue to increase long-term demand for the services we provide. While we treat patients of all ages, most of our patients are 65 and older, and the number of Medicare enrollees is expected to grow approximately 3% per year for the foreseeable future, reaching approximately 73 million people over the age of 65 by 2030. More specifically, the average age of our Medicare patients is approximately 76, and the population group ranging in ages from 75 to 79 is expected to grow at approximately 5% per year through 2026. We believe the demand for the services we provide will continue to increase as the U.S. population ages. We believe these factors align with our strengths in, and focus on, inpatient rehabilitation services.
Despite the growing demand for inpatient rehabilitation services, the number of inpatient rehabilitation facilities has remained relatively stable — decreasing modestly from 1,182 in 2015 to 1,180 in 2021. This supply-demand imbalance is partly responsible for the relatively low conversion rate of inpatient rehabilitation eligible patients. We believe the percentage of patients who are discharged from acute-care hospitals with one or more of 13 specified medical conditions that CMS ties to IRF eligibility and subsequently admitted to an IRF is approximately 13% based on Medicare fee-for-service data, which is the only publicly available data on the subject. To respond to the strong demand for our services, we continue to develop our current markets through bed additions and to construct or acquire hospitals in new markets. Since 2012, we have opened or acquired 53 new hospitals and increased the number of licensed beds we operate by approximately 56%, or 3,700 beds.
Strategy and 2023 Strategic Priorities
Our overall strategy is to expand our network of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, add capacity to existing hospitals, further strengthen our relationships with healthcare systems, provider networks, and payors in order to connect patient care across the healthcare continuum, and to deliver superior patient outcomes in a cost-effective manner. We believe this strategy, along with our demonstrated ability to adapt to changes in healthcare, positions us for success in the evolving healthcare delivery system. In pursuit of our strategy, we established the following priorities for 2023.
•Growth. We target the addition of 6 to 10 new inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and 80 to 120 beds to existing hospitals per year. In 2021, we opened 8 new hospitals (350 beds total) and added 117 beds to existing hospitals. In 2022, we opened 9 new hospitals (410 beds total) and added 87 beds to existing hospitals. In 2023, we plan to open 8 hospitals (approximately 395 beds) and add 80 to 100 beds to existing hospitals. We also believe we will continue to have organic growth opportunities based on our track record of growth, planned bed additions at a number of existing hospitals, and the maturation of newly opened locations.
•Operational Initiatives. Our priorities include operational initiatives that build on momentum from recent years. We believe our care coordination efforts have and will continue to contribute to reductions in discharges to skilled nursing facilities, higher discharges to community, and improved patient experience. Our care coordination program is the integrative approach to a patient’s care that includes coordination with physicians, acute-care hospitals, and other post-acute providers to ensure the best overall care is provided to the patient.
We will continue to demonstrate our value proposition to Medicare Advantage payors by providing superior patient outcomes, including higher discharge to community rates and lower lengths of stay, compared to alternative sites of care. The Medicare Advantage enrollment growth rate is greater than that of traditional Medicare fee-for-service, and our payor mix has shifted accordingly. Medicare Advantage payors represented 8.4% of our net operating revenues in 2017 and 15.1% in 2022. We believe our outcomes and quality of care data have helped drive a significant improvement in the payments we receive from Medicare Advantage payors. For example, reimbursement based on the type of patient/treatment required, commonly referred to as the case mix group basis (“CMG”), is typically greater than reimbursement on a per-diem rate basis, and we increased the percentage of our Medicare Advantage revenue paid based on CMG from approximately 58% in 2017 to approximately 88% in 2022.
Given the significant number of stroke patients in need of post-acute care, we will continue working to build our stroke market share through our strategic sponsorship of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, the IRF treatment recommendations published by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and the Journal of the American Medical Association, our care coordination, and our hospitals’ participation in The Joint Commission’s Disease-Specific Care Certification Program. As of December 31, 2022, 130 of our 153 hospitals held stroke-specific certifications that required us to demonstrate effective use of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines to manage and optimize stroke care and an organized approach to performance measurement and evaluation of clinical outcomes. In 
2022, approximately 6% of patients recovering from a stroke in the U.S. were treated at our hospitals, accounting for approximately 19% of our overall patient mix.
We will continue to develop and implement post-acute solutions that allow us to apply our clinical expertise, large post-acute datasets, electronic medical record technologies, and strategic partnerships to drive improved patient outcomes and lower the cost of care across the entire post-acute episode, such as our fall prevention model rolled out to hospitals in late 2021.
We will seek to expand efforts and initiatives to recruit and retain a qualified clinical workforce. In 2022, we implemented a centralized nurse recruiting model to create recruiting efficiencies, shorten the hiring process, and improve the candidate experience.
We will continue to install in our hospitals a hemodialysis system with which we are now able to provide inpatient dialysis to our patients without relying on third-parties. Historically, our patients have received dialysis from third-party vendors, either onsite or offsite as available, often resulting in interruptions to their therapy schedules. With this new onsite hemodialysis system, we can provide our patients dialysis without interrupting therapy or requiring patient travel, which lowers our cost of treatment and improves patient satisfaction. As of December 31, 2022, we had installed these systems in 41 of our hospitals.
•Capital Structure. We seek to maintain balance sheet flexibility, consider opportunistic refinancings and augment returns from investments in operations with shareholder distributions via common stock dividends and repurchases of our common stock. Our debt portfolio is concentrated in long-dated fixed-rate debt. Our free cash flow is the primary source of funding for the considerable investment in our de novo and bed addition growth plans. As an additional source of liquidity, we can access our $1 billion revolving credit facility of which $912 million was available for borrowing as of December 31, 2022. Our strong balance sheet as well as our leverage and liquidity profiles mitigate exposure to interest rate volatility and near-term refinancing risks.
For additional discussion of our strategic priorities as well as our progress toward our priorities in 2022, including operating results, growth, and shareholder distributions, and our business outlook, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview,” “Results of Operations,” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Human Capital Management
Overview of Our Employees. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 35,000 individuals. In the healthcare services sector, many professionals, such as nurses, desire flexible work arrangements. Accordingly, part-time and per diem employees represent a large percentage of our employee population. Except for 50 employees at one hospital (approximately 15% of that hospital’s workforce), none of our employees are represented by a labor union as of December 31, 2022. The chart below includes a breakdown of our employees.

Type | Employees
Total Employees | 34,519 
Full-time Employees | 20,839 
Part-time Employees | 2,559 
Pool/Per-diem Employees | 11,121 

In some markets, the shortage of clinical personnel is a significant operating issue facing healthcare providers. Shortages of nurses and other clinical personnel, including therapists, may, from time to time, require us to increase use of more costly temporary personnel, which we refer to as “contract labor,” and other types of premium pay programs. In order to recruit and retain those clinical employees, we maintain a total rewards program that we view as a combination of the tangible components of pay and benefits with the intangible components of a culture that encourages learning, development, and a supportive work environment. We believe our outstanding employee engagement scores, discussed below, evidence that our human capital management efforts have been successful. We also believe our recognition as one of Modern Healthcare’s “Best Places to Work” is further evidence of that success. We focus on the following strategic human capital imperatives:
•Maintaining competitive compensation and benefit programs that reward and recognize employee performance;
•Fostering a strong culture that values diversity, equity, and inclusion; and
•Emphasizing employee development and engagement to attract talent and reduce turnover.
Compensation and Benefits. Maintaining competitive compensation and benefit programs that reward and recognize employee performance furthers our goal to attract, retain, and motivate employees who will help us deliver high-quality patient care. We are also committed to providing comprehensive benefit options that will allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. In our compensation and benefit programs:
•we provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location.
•we engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry and by specific market, and to recommend design elements for those programs.
•we base annual increases and incentive compensation on merit, which is communicated to employees through our talent management process as part of our annual review procedures.
•all full-time and most part-time employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a retirement plan, a wellness program, telemedicine, tuition reimbursement, an employee assistance program, and life and disability/accident coverage.
•we provide an employer match on retirement plan contributions.
•we also offer a wide variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including pre-paid legal services, dental insurance, vision insurance, hospital indemnity insurance, accident insurance, critical illness insurance, supplemental life insurance, disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, auto/home insurance, and identity theft insurance.
•we have various short-term incentive plans for field leadership, most marketing/sales employees, and executives.
•we make annual grants of restricted stock to employees at various levels, including non-executive management, to foster a strong sense of ownership and align the interests of management with those of our stockholders.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We believe fostering a strong culture that values diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DE&I, allows us to recruit and retain diverse employees and provide high-quality care to our diverse patients. We maintain a DE&I program that is overseen by a DE&I department and supported by Hospital Diversity Committees. Together, they design and execute initiatives that strengthen relationships, improve communication, and increase understanding, so we can better serve each other, our patients, and our communities. We believe our DE&I program furthers our efforts to provide culturally competent care. The key components of our DE&I program are:
•Workforce Attraction and Development – We seek to build our workforce to represent and reflect the communities we serve, which allows us to provide culturally competent care. In addition, we are committed to ensuring that all our employees are trained on DE&I topics as a foundational element of our employee and leadership development curriculum. Our other DE&I initiatives include scholastic partnerships with historically black colleges, recruitment tools to help identify and attract diverse talent, a website career tool to help veterans find jobs that closely align with their specific skills, and ongoing policy and procedure reviews to incorporate guidance and practices that align with our DE&I mission.
•Community Partnership – We establish and maintain relationships with local organizations to improve health outcomes in our communities. An example of this type of partnership is our arrangement with Holy Family Cristo Rey Catholic High School in Birmingham. This partnership allows adolescents from disadvantaged groups to gain tangible work experience in our corporate office while earning funds for school tuition. In 2022, we sponsored six students. Our other community initiatives include an annual report that provides information on our DE&I initiatives to people outside the company. We also have memberships and active involvement in local chapters of the National Association of Health Service Executives, an organization that promotes the advancement and development of minority healthcare leaders. We provide training and mentorship to the next generation of healthcare leaders with the goal of helping them develop the skills and passion for inpatient rehabilitation. In addition, we are active participants in a regional working group of Alabama-based businesses convened to discuss and share DE&I best practices.
•Supplier Diversity – We maintain a supplier base program that offers contracting opportunities with manufacturers, distributors and service providers that are certified as minority-owned, veteran-owned and small disadvantage-owned businesses, and we continue to research and identify additional diverse supplier certifying organizations.
We have undertaken other initiatives to emphasize the importance of DE&I in the workplace and its role in providing the best quality patient care. For example, we participate in the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Pledge. This coalition of chief executive officers is dedicated to advancing DE&I in the workplace. Every three to five years, we engage a third-party consulting agency to help us evaluate our program and explore possible enhancements. We then provide the feedback to our board of directors. We have published a series of video conversations with various employees and members of executive management to highlight personal experience to promote DE&I throughout the organization. In addition, the DE&I department works closely with the quality, clinical and case management departments to improve health equity and ensure our interprofessional health care teams have the resources they need to provide culturally competent care.
Employee Development and Engagement. We believe promoting employee development and engagement furthers our ability to attract and retain nurses, therapists, and other healthcare professionals in a highly competitive environment where staffing shortages are not uncommon. We track and measure therapist and nurse turnover for our full-time employees (excluding those at new stores and most at the corporate office) on a quarterly and annual basis for significant trends and outliers, but we do not believe comparisons to benchmarks are material given the variations in survey data across markets, hospital sizes, practice settings, and practice specialties. The table below shows those turnover rates for 2022 and 2021.

 | 2022 | 2021 
Therapist | 9.1% | 7.9% 
Nurse | 28.1% | 27.4%

We support the long-term career aspirations of our employees through education and personal development.
•Education Opportunities. We offer our nurses an opportunity to advance their academic degrees at a reduced tuition rate of 20% to 50% of the total program cost. To date, approximately 1,521 of our nurses have taken advantage of this opportunity. Additionally, our full-time inpatient nursing and therapy staff have unlimited access to online education and training to ensure continuing education units are available at no cost.
•Tuition Reimbursement/Scholarship Programs. Employees also have the opportunity to advance their education through our tuition reimbursement and scholarship programs. We reimbursed over $1.2 million in tuition and paid over $2.8 million toward employees’ student loan debt in 2022. 
•Academic Endowments. We endowed five scholarships for deserving students from underrepresented groups pursuing degrees in nursing and allied health fields.
•Therapy Grants. We fund research projects to investigate the impact and effectiveness of therapy in the inpatient rehabilitation setting. In recent years, we have funded studies and research on topics ranging from caregiver education to the effectiveness of occupation-centered interventions. The program is open to qualified candidates, including employees.
•Other Employee Development Programs:
*career ladders that offer paths to develop, demonstrate, and be rewarded for expanded responsibility in nursing, therapy and case management;
*formal coaching online development library that provides access to a wide range of readily available internal and external content on many topics important for success in current or desired jobs;
*developing future leaders program that develops nurses and therapists for supervisory positions and develops nurse and therapy supervisors for higher level positions;
*leadership precepting that provides new leaders 6-12 months of structured mentoring from experienced, high-performing peers;
*leadership coaching that provides six months of executive coaching to high performing leaders;
*developing future chief nursing officers program that provides 12-18 months of intensive on-the-job experience to develop participants for future chief nursing officer job openings; and
*developing future chief executive officers program that provides 18-24 months of intensive on-the-job experience to develop participants for future hospital chief executive officer openings.
To further aid in employee development, we have invested money in best-in-class technology to offer on-demand learning and development programs, and leadership coaching programs. Another important aspect of employee development is succession planning. We annually review our talent to identify potential successors for key positions and to identify candidates for accelerated development based on their performance and potential. The annual process includes an assessment of each employee’s promotability based on a set of leadership core competencies defined as part of the company’s talent strategy.
We believe employee engagement is another important driver of employee retention. We conduct an annual employee engagement survey open to all of our employees. In 2022, 80% of our employees participated in the survey, which measures perceptions based on responses to 38 questions. In 2022, we scored above healthcare benchmarks as a company in each of the following categories on the survey:

•ethics and compliance | •teamwork 
•culture of safety | •engagement 
•diversity, equity, and inclusion | •culture of trust
•work environment | •individual value
•leadership | •communication 

Competition
The inpatient rehabilitation industry, outside of our leading position, is highly fragmented. Our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals compete primarily with rehabilitation units, most of which are within acute-care hospitals, in the markets we serve. An acute-care hospital operating its own unit, particularly one owned or operated by a large public company or not-for-profit that has a dominant position in the local market, can be a formidable competitor because 91% of our patients come from acute-care hospitals. There are several privately held companies offering post-acute rehabilitation services that compete with us primarily in select geographic markets. In addition, there is a public company that is primarily focused on other post-acute care services but also operates 31 freestanding inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. Other providers of post-acute care services compete for some rehabilitation patients. For example, nursing homes may market themselves as offering certain rehabilitation services, particularly to patients not in need of intensive rehabilitation therapy, even though those nursing homes are not required to offer the same level of care, and are not licensed, as hospitals. The primary competitive factors in any given market include the quality of care and service provided, the treatment outcomes achieved, the relationship and reputation with managed care and other private payors and the acute-care hospitals, physicians, or other referral sources in the market, and the regulatory barriers to entry in certificate of need states. The ability to work as part of an integrated delivery payment model with other providers, including the ability to deliver quality patient outcomes and cost-effective care, could become an increasingly important factor in competition if a significant number of people in a market are participants in one or more of these models. See the “Regulation—Relationships with Physicians and Other Providers” and “Regulation—Certificates of Need” sections below for further discussion of some of these factors. For a list of our inpatient rehabilitation markets by state, see the table in Item 2, Properties.
Regulatory and Reimbursement Challenges
Healthcare is a highly regulated industry facing many well-publicized regulatory and reimbursement challenges driven by escalating costs and the pursuit of better quality of care. The Medicare reimbursement system for inpatient rehabilitation has changed significantly over the years. The future of many aspects of healthcare regulation remains uncertain. Any regulatory or legislative changes impacting the healthcare industry ultimately may affect, among other things, reimbursement of healthcare providers, consumers’ access to coverage of health services, including among non-Medicare aged population segments within commercial insurance markets and Medicaid enrollees, and competition among providers. Changes may also affect the delivery of healthcare services to patients by providers and the regulatory compliance obligations associated with those services.
Successful healthcare providers are those able to adapt to changes in the regulatory and operating environments, build strategic relationships across the healthcare continuum, and consistently provide high-quality, cost-effective care. We believe 
we have the necessary capabilities — change agility, strategic relationships, quality of patient outcomes, cost effectiveness, and ability to capitalize on growth opportunities — to adapt to and succeed in a dynamic, highly regulated industry, and we have a proven track record of doing so. For more in-depth discussion of the primary challenges and risks related to our business, particularly the changes in Medicare reimbursement, increased compliance and enforcement burdens, and changes to our operating environment resulting from healthcare reform, see “Sources of Revenues—Medicare Reimbursement” and “Regulation” below in this section as well as Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”
Sources of Revenues
We receive payment for patient care services from the federal government (primarily under the Medicare program), managed care plans and private insurers, and, to a considerably lesser degree, state governments (under their respective Medicaid or similar programs) and directly from patients. Revenues and receivables from Medicare are significant to our operations. The federal and state governments establish payment rates as described in more detail below. We negotiate the payment rates with non-governmental group purchasers of healthcare services that are included in “Managed care” in the tables below, including private insurance companies, employers, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”), and other managed care plans. Patients are generally not responsible for the difference between established gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, and other private insurance plans, HMOs, or PPOs but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance features of their coverage. Medicare, through its Medicare Advantage program, offers Medicare-eligible individuals an opportunity to participate in managed care plans. Revenues from Medicare and Medicare Advantage represent approximately 80% of total revenues.
The sources and relative mix of our revenues for the last three years are:

 | For the Year Ended December 31,

Medicare Reimbursement
Medicare is a federal program that provides hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, qualified disabled persons, and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicare, through statutes and regulations, establishes reimbursement methodologies and rates for various types of healthcare providers, facilities, and services. Each year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (“MedPAC”), an independent agency that advises the United States Congress on issues affecting Medicare, makes payment policy recommendations to Congress for a variety of Medicare payment systems including, among others, the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system (the “IRF-PPS”). MedPAC also makes recommendations on regulatory actions to CMS. Neither Congress nor CMS is obligated to adopt MedPAC recommendations, and, based on outcomes in previous years, there can be no assurance either will adopt MedPAC’s recommendations in a given year. However, MedPAC’s recommendations have, and could in the future, become the basis for subsequent legislative or, as discussed below, regulatory action.
The Medicare statutes are subject to change from time to time. With respect to Medicare reimbursement, the ACA provides for specific reductions to healthcare providers’ annual market basket updates and other payment policy changes. In August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011 providing for an automatic 2% reduction, or “sequestration,” of Medicare program payments for all healthcare providers. Sequestration took effect April 1, 2013 and, as a result of subsequent legislation, will continue through mid-fiscal year 2032 unless Congress and the President take further action. In response to the public health emergency associated with the pandemic, Congress and the President suspended sequestration through March 31, 2022. Additional Medicare payment reductions are also possible under the Statutory Pay-As-
You-Go Act of 2010 (“Statutory PAYGO”). Statutory PAYGO requires, among other things, that mandatory spending and revenue legislation not increase the federal budget deficit over a 5- or 10-year period. If the Office of Management and Budget (the “OMB”) finds there is a deficit in the federal budget, Statutory PAYGO requires OMB to order sequestration of Medicare. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 would result in budget deficits necessitating a 4% reduction in Medicare program payments under the Statutory PAYGO, but subsequent legislation enacted by Congress suspended until 2025 the Statutory PAYGO reductions that would have gone into effect. In the future, concerns about the federal deficit, national debt levels and the solvency of the Medicare trust fund could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the Medicare program, or both. Healthcare will almost certainly be the subject of significant regulatory and legislative changes regardless of the party in control of the executive and legislative branches of state and federal governments.
From time to time, Medicare regulations, including reimbursement methodologies and rates, can be further modified by CMS. Subject to its statutory authority, CMS may make some prospective payment system changes. For example, CMS changed the IRF-PPS, effective October 1, 2019, to replace the FIM™ assessment instrument with new patient assessment measures, which we refer to as “Section GG functional measures” or “Section GG” based on the designation CMS assigned to them. Section GG affects patients’ classification into case-mix groupings, relative weights, and length-of-stay values under the IRF-PPS, which in turn affect our reimbursement amounts. In some instances, CMS’s modifications can have a substantial impact on healthcare providers. In accordance with Medicare laws and statutes, CMS makes annual adjustments to Medicare payment rates in prospective payment systems, including the IRF-PPS, by what is commonly known as a “market basket update.” CMS may take other regulatory action affecting rates as well. For example, under the ACA, CMS requires IRFs to submit data on certain quality of care measures for the IRF quality reporting program. A facility’s failure to submit the required quality data results in a two percentage point reduction to that facility’s annual market basket increase factor for payments made for discharges in a subsequent Medicare fiscal year. IRFs began submitting quality data to CMS in October 2012. All of our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals have met the reporting deadlines to date resulting in no corresponding reimbursement reductions.
We cannot predict the adjustments to Medicare payment rates Congress or CMS may make in the future. Congress, MedPAC, and CMS will continue to address reimbursement rates for a variety of healthcare settings. Any additional downward adjustment to rates or limitations on reimbursement for the types of facilities we operate and services we provide could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For additional discussion of the risks associated with our concentration of revenues from the federal government or with potential changes to the statutes or regulations governing Medicare reimbursement, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”
Although reductions or changes in reimbursement from governmental or third-party payors and regulatory changes affecting our business represent one of the most significant challenges to our business, our operations are also affected by other rules and regulations that indirectly affect reimbursement for our services, such as data coding rules and patient coverage rules and determinations. For example, Medicare providers like us can be negatively affected by the adoption of coverage policies, either at the national or local level, that determine whether an item or service is covered and under what clinical circumstances it is considered to be reasonable and necessary. Current CMS coverage rules require inpatient rehabilitation services to be ordered by a physician and be coordinated by an interdisciplinary team and the admission to the IRF must be reviewed and approved by a specialized rehabilitation physician. The interdisciplinary team must meet weekly to review patient status and make any needed adjustments to the individualized plan of care. Qualified personnel must provide the rehabilitation nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, social services, psychological services, and prosthetic and orthotic services that may be needed. Medicare contractors processing claims for CMS make coverage determinations regarding medical necessity that can represent novel or restrictive interpretations of the CMS coverage rules. Those interpretations are not made through a notice and comment review process. We cannot predict how future CMS coverage rule interpretations or any new local coverage determinations will affect us. However, more restrictive coverage interpretations can limit or delay our reimbursement for services provided to potentially large pools of patients with similar medical conditions.
In the ordinary course, Medicare reimbursement claims made by healthcare providers, including inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, are subject to audit from time to time by governmental payors and their agents, such as the Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”) that act as fiscal intermediaries for all Medicare billings, as well as the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (the “HHS-OIG”), CMS, and state Medicaid programs. In addition to those audits conducted by existing MACs, CMS has developed and instituted various Medicare audit programs under which CMS contracts with private companies to conduct claims and medical record audits. Some contractors are paid a percentage of the overpayments recovered. The Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”) conduct payment reviews of claims, which can examine coding, overall billing accuracy, and medical necessity. When conducting an audit, the RACs receive claims data directly from MACs on a monthly or quarterly basis.
CMS has also established Unified Program Integrity Contractors (“UPICs”), previously known as Zone Program Integrity Contractors, to perform fraud, waste, and abuse detection, deterrence and prevention activities for Medicare and Medicaid claims. Like the RACs, the UPICs conduct audits and have the ability to refer matters to the HHS-OIG or the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”). Unlike RACs, however, UPICs do not receive a specific financial incentive based on the amount of the payment errors they identify.
As a matter of course, we undertake significant efforts through training, education, and documentation to ensure compliance with coding and medical necessity coverage rules. Despite our efforts to ensure accurate coding and assessment of patients, audits may lead to assertions that we have been underpaid or overpaid by Medicare or that we have submitted improper claims in some instances. Audits may also require us to incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and defend the validity of payments and claims, and ultimately require us to refund any amounts determined to have been overpaid. We cannot predict when or how these audit programs will affect us. Any denial of a claim for payment, either as a result of an audit or ordinary course payment review by the MAC, is subject to an appeals process that can take years to complete. For additional discussion of these audits and the risks associated with them, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”
In response to the public health emergency associated with the pandemic, Congress and CMS adopted several statutory and regulatory measures intended to provide relief to healthcare providers in order to ensure patients would continue to have adequate access to care. On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the CARES Act, which authorized the cash distribution of pandemic relief funds from the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to healthcare providers. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the “2021 Budget Act”), signed into law on December 27, 2020, provided for additional provider relief funds. We did not accept any provider relief funds.
As noted above, our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals receive a fixed payment reimbursement amount per discharge under the IRF-PPS based on the patient’s rehabilitation impairment category and other characteristics and conditions identified by the attending clinicians. In order to qualify for reimbursement under the IRF-PPS, our hospitals must comply with various Medicare rules and regulations including documentation and coverage requirements, or specifications as to what conditions must be met to qualify for reimbursement. These requirements relate to, among other things, pre-admission screening, and individual treatment planning that all delineate the role of physicians in ordering and overseeing patient care. For example, a physician must approve admission of each patient and in doing so determine that the treatment of the patient in an IRF setting is reasonable and necessary. In addition, to qualify as an IRF under Medicare rules, a facility must be primarily focused on treating patients with one of 13 specified medical conditions that typically require intensive therapy and supervision, such as stroke, brain injury, hip fracture, certain neurological conditions, and spinal cord injury. Specifically, at least 60% of a facility’s patients must have a diagnosis or qualifying comorbidity from at least one of these 13 conditions, which requirement is known as the “60% Rule.” Also, each patient admitted to an IRF must be able to tolerate a minimum of three hours of therapy per day for five days per week and must have a registered nurse available 24 hours, each day of the week.
Under IRF-PPS, CMS is required to adjust the payment rates based on an IRF-specific market basket index. The annual market basket update is designed to reflect changes over time in the prices of a mix of goods and services used by IRFs. In setting annual market basket updates, CMS uses data furnished by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for price proxy purposes, primarily in three categories: Producer Price Indexes, Consumer Price Indexes, and Employment Cost Indexes. With IRF-PPS, our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals retain the difference, if any, between the fixed payment from Medicare and their operating costs. Accordingly, our hospitals benefit from being cost-effective providers.
On July 29, 2021, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for fiscal year 2022 IRF-PPS (the “2022 IRF Rule”). The 2022 IRF Rule implemented a net 1.9% market basket increase (market basket update of 2.6% reduced by a productivity adjustment of 0.7%) effective for discharges between October 1, 2021 and September 30, 2022. The productivity adjustment equals the trailing 10-year average of changes in annual economy-wide private nonfarm business multi-factor productivity. The 2022 IRF Rule also included changes that impacted our hospital-by-hospital base rate for Medicare reimbursement. Such changes included, but were not limited to, revisions to the wage index and labor-related share values, updates to outlier payments and updates to the case-mix group relative weights and average lengths of stay values. The 2022 IRF Rule also added one new quality reporting measure and updated the denominator of another measure.
On July 27, 2022, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for fiscal year 2023 IRF-PPS (the “2023 IRF Rule”). The 2023 IRF Rule implements a net 3.9% market basket increase (market basket update of 4.2% reduced by a productivity adjustment of 0.3%) effective for discharges between October 1, 2022 and September 30, 2023. The 2023 IRF Rule also includes changes that impact our hospital-by-hospital base rate for Medicare reimbursement. Such changes include, but are not limited to, revisions to the wage index and labor-related share values, updates to outlier payments and updates to the case-mix group relative weights and average lengths of stay values. Based on our analysis, which utilizes, among other things, the acuity of our patients annualized over the twelve-month prior period ended June 30, 2022, our experience with outlier payments over 
that same time frame, and other factors, we believe the 2023 IRF Rule will result in a net increase to our Medicare payment rates of approximately 4.0% effective October 1, 2022.
The proposed rulemaking for fiscal year 2023 for the IRF-PPS included a request for comment on a potential change that could be included in future rulemaking. Based on a recent HHS-OIG report, CMS is considering whether to modify the IRF “transfer” payment policy to reduce reimbursement for early discharges to home health, similar to how early discharges to acute-care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, long-term acute-care hospitals, or another IRF, are currently treated under the IRF-PPS. HHS-OIG estimated that its recommended change to the policy could reduce total IRF industry reimbursements by approximately 6% based on 2017 and 2018 data. In the 2023 IRF Rule, CMS acknowledged industry comments on the policy and noted those comments would be taken under advisement for future rulemaking.
Unlike our inpatient services, our outpatient services are primarily reimbursed under the Medicare Part B physician fee schedule. On November 1, 2022, CMS released its final notice of rulemaking for the payment policies under the physician fee schedule and other revisions to Part B policies for calendar year 2023. The updates to the fee schedule are not expected to be material to us.
For additional discussion of the Medicare payment rules and other regulatory and legislative initiatives affecting Medicare reimbursement that could impact our businesses, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”
Medicare Advantage, Managed Care and Other Discount Plans
We negotiate payment rates with certain large group purchasers of healthcare services, including Medicare Advantage plans, managed care plans, private insurance companies, and third-party administrators. Managed care contracts typically have terms between one and three years, although we have a number of managed care contracts that automatically renew each year (with pre-defined rate increases) unless a party elects to terminate the contract. In 2022, typical rate increases for our contracts ranged from 2-4%. We cannot provide any assurance we will continue to receive increases in the future. Our managed care staff focuses on establishing and re-negotiating contracts that provide equitable reimbursement for the services provided.
As the percentage of Medicare-eligible beneficiaries choosing Medicare Advantage over traditional Medicare has grown, we have seen the percentage of our revenue derived from Medicare Advantage payors grow. In 2022, approximately 48% of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans. This percentage has steadily increased over time since 2003. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the share of all Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans will rise to about 61% by 2032. We expect the percentage of our total revenues attributable to Medicare Advantage plans to continue to grow as well. Typically, Medicare Advantage and other managed care plans reimburse us less than traditional Medicare for the same type of care and patient, but that differential has been shrinking in recent years.
Medicaid Reimbursement
Medicaid is a jointly administered and funded federal and state program that provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying individuals who are deemed unable to afford healthcare. As the Medicaid program is administered by the individual states under the oversight of CMS in accordance with certain regulatory and statutory guidelines, there are substantial differences in reimbursement methodologies and coverage policies from state to state. Many states have experienced shortfalls in their Medicaid budgets and are implementing significant cuts in Medicaid reimbursement rates. Additionally, certain states control Medicaid expenditures through restricting or eliminating coverage of some services. Continuing downward pressure on Medicaid payment rates could cause a decline in that portion of our Net operating revenues. However, for the year ended December 31, 2022, Medicaid payments represented only 4.2% of our consolidated Net operating revenues. In certain states in which we operate, we are experiencing an increase in Medicaid patients, partially the result of expanded coverage consistent with the intent of the ACA and expanded coverage resulting from regulatory actions during the COVID-19 public health emergency. For additional discussion, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, “Changes in our payor mix or the acuity of our patients could adversely affect our Net operating revenues or our profitability.”
Cost Reports
Because of our participation in Medicare and Medicaid, we are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenue, costs, and expenses associated with the services provided by healthcare providers to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. These annual cost reports are subject to routine audits which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. These audits are used for determining if any under- or over-payments were made to these programs and to set payment levels for future years. Medicare also makes retroactive 
adjustments to payments for certain low-income patients after comparing subsequently published statistical data from CMS to the cost report data. We cannot predict what retroactive adjustments, if any, will be made, but we do not anticipate these adjustments will have a material impact on us.
Regulation
The healthcare industry is subject to significant federal, state, and local regulation that affects our business activities by controlling the reimbursement we receive for services provided, requiring licensure or certification of our operations, regulating our relationships with physicians and other referral sources, regulating the use of our properties, and controlling our growth. State and local healthcare regulation may cover additional matters such as nurse staffing ratios, healthcare worker safety, marijuana legalization, and assisted suicide. We are also subject to the broader federal and state regulations that prohibit fraud and abuse in the delivery of healthcare services. Congress, HHS-OIG, and the DOJ have historically focused on fraud and abuse in healthcare. Since the 1980s, a steady stream of changes have stiffened penalties or made it easier for DOJ to impose liability on companies and individuals, and the pace of these changes has only been increasing. The 2018 Budget Act continues this emphasis by increasing the criminal and civil penalties that can be imposed for violating federal health care laws. As a healthcare provider, we are subject to periodic audits, examinations and investigations conducted by, or at the direction of, government investigative and oversight agencies. Failure to comply with applicable federal and state healthcare regulations can result in a provider’s exclusion from participation in government reimbursement programs and in substantial civil and criminal penalties.
We undertake significant effort and expense to provide the medical, nursing, therapy, and ancillary services required to comply with local, state, and federal regulations, as well as, for most hospitals, accreditation standards of The Joint Commission and, for some hospitals, the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities. Accredited hospitals are subject to periodic resurvey to ensure the standards are being met.
Beyond healthcare specific regulations, we face increasing state and local regulation in areas, such as labor and employment and data privacy, traditionally subject to only or primarily federal regulation. In addition to the risk and burden of new, additional, or more stringent regulatory standards, these state and local regulations often conflict with federal regulation, and with each other. Given the number of locations in which we operate, increasing state and local regulation, which may be more stringent than federal regulation and may even conflict with federal or other state or local regulation, represents a significant burden and risk to us.
We maintain a comprehensive ethics and compliance program to promote conduct and business practices that meet or exceed requirements under laws, regulations, and industry standards. The program monitors the Company’s performance on, and raises awareness of, various regulatory requirements among employees and emphasizes the importance of complying with governmental laws and regulations. As part of the compliance program, we provide annual compliance training to our employees, Board members, medical directors, vendors, and other non-employees that operate within our hospitals, and require all employees to report any violations to their supervisor or another person of authority or through a toll-free telephone hotline. Another integral part of our compliance program is a policy of non-retaliation against employees who report compliance concerns.
Licensure and Certification
Healthcare facility construction and operation are subject to numerous federal, state, and local regulations relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, acquisition and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, infection control, maintenance of adequate records and patient privacy, fire prevention, and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. Our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals are subject to periodic inspection and other reviews by governmental and non-governmental certification authorities to ensure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for facility licensure. All of our hospitals are required to be licensed.
In addition, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals must be certified by CMS to participate in the Medicare program and generally must be certified by Medicaid state agencies to participate in Medicaid programs. Certification and participation in these programs involve numerous regulatory obligations. For example, hospitals must treat at least 20 patients without reimbursement prior to certification and eligibility for Medicare reimbursement. Once certified by Medicare, hospitals undergo periodic on-site surveys and revalidations in order to maintain their certification. All of our inpatient hospitals participate in the Medicare program.
Failure to comply with applicable certification requirements may make our hospitals ineligible for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement. In addition, Medicare or Medicaid may seek retroactive reimbursement from noncompliant hospitals 
or otherwise impose sanctions for noncompliance. Non-governmental payors often have the right to terminate provider contracts if the provider loses its Medicare or Medicaid certification.
All Medicare providers are subject to employee screening requirements and associated fees. The screening of employees with patient access must include a licensure check and may include other procedures such as fingerprinting, criminal background checks, unscheduled and unannounced site visits, database checks, and other screening procedures prescribed by CMS. If a healthcare provider arranges or contracts with an individual or entity who is excluded by HHS-OIG from participation in a federal healthcare program, the provider may be subject to civil monetary penalties if the excluded person renders services reimbursed, directly or indirectly, by a program.
We have developed operational systems to facilitate compliance with the various standards and requirements of the Medicare program and have established ongoing quality assurance activities; however, given the complex nature of governmental healthcare regulations, there can be no assurance Medicare, Medicaid, or other regulatory authorities will not allege instances of noncompliance. A determination by a regulatory authority that a hospital is not in compliance with applicable requirements could also lead to the assessment of fines or other penalties, loss of licensure, exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid, and the imposition of requirements that the offending hospital must take corrective action.
Certificates of Need
In some states and U.S. territories where we operate, the construction or expansion of facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities, or the introduction of new beds or inpatient services may be subject to review by and prior approval of state regulatory bodies under a “certificate of need,” or “CON,” law. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 40% of our licensed beds are in states or U.S. territories that have CON laws. CON laws require a reviewing authority or agency to determine the public need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities and services. These laws also generally require approvals for capital expenditures involving inpatient rehabilitation hospitals if such capital expenditures exceed certain thresholds. In addition, CON laws in some states require us to abide by certain charity care commitments as a condition for approving a CON. Any instance where we are subject to a CON law, we must obtain it before acquiring, opening, reclassifying, or expanding a healthcare facility or starting a new healthcare program.
We potentially face opposition any time we initiate a project requiring a new or amended CON or seek to acquire an existing CON. This opposition may arise either from competing national or regional companies or from local hospitals or other providers which file competing applications or oppose the proposed CON project. Opposition to our applications may delay or prevent our future addition of beds or hospitals in given markets or increase our costs in seeking those additions. The necessity for these approvals serves as a barrier to entry and has the potential to limit competition for us (in markets where we hold a CON) and for other providers (in markets where we are seeking a CON). We have generally been successful in obtaining CONs or similar approvals, although there can be no assurance we will achieve similar success in the future, and the likelihood of success varies by locality and state.
In an attempt to reduce regulation and increase competition, lawmakers in several states have recently proposed modification or even full repeal of CON laws. In 2019, Florida enacted legislation to repeal CON laws for several provider types, including IRFs. We believe CON-related legislation and regulation changes, including both repeal and expansion of CON requirements, will continue to be proposed in various states for the foreseeable future.
False Claims
The federal False Claims Act (the “FCA”) imposes liability for the knowing presentation of a false claim to the United States government and provides for penalties equal to three times the actual amount of any overpayments plus up to approximately $25,000 per claim. Federal civil penalties will be adjusted to account for inflation each year. In addition, the FCA allows private persons, known as “relators,” to file complaints under seal and provides a period of time for the government to investigate such complaints and determine whether to intervene in them and take over the handling of all or part of such complaints. The government and relators may also allege violations of the FCA for the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government in a timely manner following identification of an overpayment. This is known as a “reverse false claim.” The government deems identification of the overpayment to occur when a person has, or should have through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment.
Because we have hundreds of thousands of claims a year for which we are reimbursed by Medicare and other federal payors and there is a relatively long statute of limitations, a billing error, cost reporting error or disagreement over physician medical judgment could result in significant damages and civil and criminal penalties under the FCA. Many states have also adopted similar laws relating to state government payments for healthcare services. The ACA amended the FCA to expand the 
definition of false claim, to make it easier for the government to initiate and conduct investigations, to enhance the monetary reward to relators where prosecutions are ultimately successful, and to extend the statute of limitations on claims by the government. The federal government has become increasingly aggressive in asserting that incidents of erroneous billing or record keeping represent FCA violations and in challenging the medical judgment of independent physicians as the basis for FCA allegations. Furthermore, well-publicized enforcement actions indicate that the federal government has increasingly sought to use statistical sampling to extrapolate allegations to larger pools of claims or to infer liability without proving knowledge of falsity of individual claims. A violation of the FCA by us could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Even the assertion of a violation could have an adverse effect upon our stock price or reputation. For additional discussion, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Note 18, Contingencies and Other Commitments, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Relationships with Physicians and Other Providers
Anti-Kickback Law. Various state and federal laws regulate relationships between providers of healthcare services, including management or service contracts and investment relationships. Among the most important of these restrictions is a federal law prohibiting the offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of remuneration by individuals or entities to induce referrals of patients for services reimbursed under the Medicare or Medicaid programs (the “Anti-Kickback Law”). The ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Law to provide that proving violations of this law does not require proving actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation. Another amendment made it clear that Anti-Kickback Law violations can be the basis for claims under the FCA. These changes and those described above related to the FCA, when combined with other recent federal initiatives, are likely to increase investigation and enforcement efforts in the healthcare industry generally. In addition to standard federal criminal and civil sanctions, including imprisonment and penalties of up to $100,000 for each violation plus tripled damages for improper claims, violators of the Anti-Kickback Law may be subject to exclusion from the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs. Federal civil penalties will be adjusted to account for inflation each year. HHS-OIG regulations itemize compensation arrangements that are not viewed as illegal remuneration under the Anti-Kickback Law. Those regulations provide for certain safe harbors for identified types of compensation arrangements that, if fully complied with, assure participants in the particular arrangement that HHS-OIG will not treat that participation as a criminal offense under the Anti-Kickback Law or as the basis for an exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs or the imposition of civil sanctions. 
On November 20, 2020, HHS-OIG finalized a rule to modernize the Anti-Kickback Law by reducing regulatory barriers to care coordination and accelerating adoption of value-based delivery and payment models (the “2020 AKL Rule”). The 2020 AKL Rule adds several new safe harbors for value-based arrangements and modifies several existing safe harbors with the goal of encouraging innovations that are beneficial to patients while maintaining necessary safeguards to protect against fraud and abuse. The 2020 AKL Rule also expands the safe harbor for cybersecurity technology by covering remuneration in the form of cybersecurity technology and services. The new and modified value-based safe harbors are available to inpatient rehabilitation providers if the applicable conditions are met. 
Failure to fall within a safe harbor does not constitute a violation of the Anti-Kickback Law, but HHS-OIG has indicated failure to fall within a safe harbor may subject an arrangement to increased scrutiny. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Law by us or one or more of our joint ventures could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Even the assertion of a violation could have an adverse effect upon our stock price or reputation.
We operate a number of our rehabilitation hospitals through joint ventures with institutional healthcare providers that may be in a position to make or influence referrals to us. In addition, we have a number of relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers, including management or service contracts. Some of these investment relationships and contractual relationships may not fall within the protection offered by a safe harbor. Despite our compliance and monitoring efforts, there can be no assurance violations of the Anti-Kickback Law will not be asserted in the future, nor can there be any assurance our defense against any such assertion would be successful.
For example, we have entered into agreements to manage our hospitals that are owned by joint ventures. Most of these agreements incorporate a percentage-based management fee. Although there is a safe harbor for personal services and management contracts, this safe harbor requires, among other things, the aggregate compensation paid to the manager over the term of the agreement be set in advance. Because our management fee may be based on a percentage of revenues, the fee arrangement may not meet this requirement. However, we believe our management arrangements satisfy the other requirements of the safe harbor for personal services and management contracts and comply with the Anti-Kickback Law.
Physician Self-Referral Law. The federal law commonly known as the “Stark law” and CMS regulations promulgated under the Stark law prohibit physicians from making referrals for “designated health services” including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physical therapy, occupational therapy, radiology services, and home health services, to an entity in 
which the physician (or an immediate family member) has an investment interest or other financial relationship, subject to certain exceptions. The Stark law also prohibits those entities from filing claims or billing Medicare for those referred services. Violators of the Stark law and regulations may be subject to recoupments, civil monetary sanctions (up to $27,750 for each violation and assessments up to three times the amount claimed for each prohibited service) and exclusion from any federal, state, or other governmental healthcare programs. The statute also provides a penalty of up to $185,000 for a circumvention scheme. Federal civil penalties will be adjusted to account for inflation each year. There are statutory exceptions to the Stark law for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including personal services contracts and leases. However, in order to be afforded protection by a Stark law exception, the financial arrangement must comply with every requirement of the applicable exception.
Under the ACA, the exception to the Stark law that currently permits physicians to refer patients to hospitals in which they have an investment or ownership interest has been dramatically limited by providing that only physician-owned hospitals with a provider agreement in place on December 31, 2010 are exempt from the general ban on self-referral. Existing physician-owned hospitals are prohibited from increasing the physician ownership percentage in the hospital after March 23, 2010. Additionally, physician-owned hospitals are prohibited from increasing the number of licensed beds after March 23, 2010, except when certain market and regulatory approval conditions are met. We have no hospitals that would be considered physician-owned under this law.
On November 20, 2020, CMS finalized a rule implementing various changes to the Stark law to provide better access and outcomes for patients by creating clearer paths for providers to serve patients through enhanced coordinated care agreements (the “2020 Stark Rule”). Notably, the 2020 Stark Rule creates permanent exceptions for value-based compensation arrangements that provide at least one value-based activity, which arrangements must further one value-based purpose, which may include: (1) coordinating and managing patient care; (2) improving quality of care for a target population; (3) reducing costs or expenditure growth without reducing quality of care; and (4) transitioning from health care delivery and payment mechanisms that are based on volume to outcome-based delivery and payment systems. In addition, the 2020 Stark Rule adopts a new exception regarding the provision of cybersecurity items to physicians and makes permanent the electronic health record exception under the Stark law. 
The complexity of the Stark law and the associated regulations and their associated strict liability provisions are a challenge for healthcare providers, who do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet one or more exceptions to the Stark law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex. Accordingly, we cannot assure that every relationship complies fully with the Stark law.
Additionally, no assurances can be given that any agency charged with enforcement of the Stark law and regulations might not assert a violation under the Stark law, nor can there be any assurance our defense against any such assertion would be successful or that new federal or state laws governing physician relationships, or new interpretations of existing laws governing such relationships, might not adversely affect relationships we have established with physicians or result in the imposition of penalties on us. A violation of the Stark law by us could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Even the assertion of a violation could have an adverse effect upon our stock price or reputation.
HIPAA
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, commonly known as “HIPAA,” broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for healthcare fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs. HIPAA also added a prohibition against incentives intended to influence decisions by Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries as to the provider from which they will receive services. In addition, HIPAA created new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse, including the Medicare Integrity Program, and an incentive program under which individuals can receive a monetary reward for providing information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of Medicare funds. Penalties for violations of HIPAA include civil and criminal monetary penalties. The HHS Office of Civil Rights (“HHS-OCR”) implemented a permanent HIPAA audit program for healthcare providers nationwide in 2016. As of December 31, 2022, we have not been selected for audit.
HIPAA and related HHS regulations contain certain administrative simplification provisions that require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for certain healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. HIPAA regulations also regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health-related information, whether communicated electronically, on paper, or orally. The regulations provide patients with significant rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used or disclosed and require healthcare providers to implement administrative, physical, and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information.
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act modifies and expands the privacy and security requirements of HIPAA. The HITECH Act applies certain of the HIPAA privacy and security requirements directly to business associates of covered entities. The modifications to existing HIPAA requirements include: expanded accounting requirements for electronic health records, tighter restrictions on marketing and fundraising, and heightened penalties and enforcement associated with noncompliance. Significantly, the HITECH Act also establishes new mandatory federal requirements for notification of breaches of security involving protected health information. HHS-OCR rules implementing the HITECH Act expand the potential liability for a breach involving protected health information to cover some instances where a subcontractor is responsible for the breaches and that individual or entity was acting within the scope of delegated authority under the related contract or engagement. These rules generally define “breach” to mean the acquisition, access, use or disclosure of protected health information in a manner not permitted by the HIPAA privacy standards, which compromises the security or privacy of protected health information. Under these rules, improper acquisition, access, use, or disclosure is presumed to be a reportable breach, unless the potentially breaching party can demonstrate a low probability that protected health information has been compromised.
In December 2020, HHS-OCR proposed a new rule that would modify HIPAA regulations. According to HHS-OCR, the proposed rule is intended to promote care coordination and value-based care. The proposed changes to the HIPAA rules also provide for strengthening individuals’ rights to access their own health information, including electronic information; improving information sharing for care coordination and case management for individuals; facilitating greater family and caregiver involvement in the care of individuals experiencing emergencies or health crises; enhancing flexibilities for disclosures in emergency or threatening circumstances, such as the opioid and COVID-19 public health emergencies; and reducing administrative burdens on HIPAA covered healthcare providers and health plans, while continuing to protect individuals’ health information privacy interests. Although one of the stated purposes of the proposed rules is to reduce healthcare providers burdens, providers would have to engage in a number of activities to come into compliance if the changes are finalized, including changing policies and procedures, changing patient privacy notices and business associate agreements and training workforce members in the new requirements. 
HHS-OCR is responsible for enforcing the requirement that covered entities notify HHS and any individual whose protected health information has been improperly acquired, accessed, used, or disclosed. In certain cases, notice of a breach is required to be made to media outlets. The heightened penalties for noncompliance range from $100 to $50,000 per violation for most violations. In the event of violations due to willful neglect that are not corrected within 30 days, penalties start at approximately $64,000 per violation and are not subject to a per violation statutory maximum. Penalties are also subject to an annual cap for multiple identical violations in a single calendar year. Pursuant to guidance from HHS-OCR, this enforcement cap ranges from a minimum of $25,000 per year to a maximum of $1,500,000 per year depending on an entity’s level of culpability. Importantly, HHS-OCR has indicated that the failure to conduct a security risk assessment or adequately implement HIPAA compliance policies could qualify as willful neglect.
In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing patient privacy concerns. Healthcare providers will continue to remain subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws, including but not limited to the California Consumer Privacy Act, that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. HHS-OIG and other regulators have also increasingly interpreted laws and regulations in a manner as to increase exposure of healthcare providers to allegations of noncompliance. Any actual or perceived violation of privacy-related laws and regulations, including HIPAA and the HITECH Act, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
Civil Monetary Penalties Law
Under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, HHS may impose civil monetary penalties on healthcare providers that present, or cause to be presented, ineligible reimbursement claims for services. The 2018 Budget Act increased the civil monetary penalties, which vary depending on the offense from $5,000 to $100,000 per violation, plus treble damages for the amount at issue and may include exclusion from federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The penalties are adjusted annually to account for inflation. HHS may seek to impose monetary penalties under this law for, among other things, offering inducements to beneficiaries for program services and filing false or fraudulent claims.
