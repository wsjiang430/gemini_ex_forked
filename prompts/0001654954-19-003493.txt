This module can also be used to create a line-up of similar facial images from which a witness may identify the suspect.
  
 Facial Recognition.  This software module uses biometric facial recognition and retrieval technology to help authorities identify possible suspects. Images taken from surveillance videos or photographs can be searched against a digital database of facial images to retrieve any desired number of faces with similar characteristics. This module can also be used at the time of booking to identify persons using multiple aliases. Using biometrics-based technology, the application can search through thousands of facial images in a matter of seconds, reducing the time it would otherwise take a witness to flip through a paper book of facial images that may or may not be similar to the description of the suspect. The Facial Recognition module then creates a selection of possible matches ranked in order of similarity to the suspect, and a percentage confidence level is attributed to each possible match. The application incorporates search engine technology, which we license from various facial recognition algorithm providers.
  
 LE Web.  This software module enables authorized personnel to access and search agency booking records stored in IWS Law Enforcement through a standard web browser from within the agency’s intranet. This module allows remote access to the IWS Law Enforcement database without requiring the user to be physically connected to the customer’s network. This application requires only that the user have access to the Internet and authorization to access the law enforcement agency’s intranet.
  
 EPI Designer for Law Enforcement.  The EPI Designer for LE software is a design solution created for the IWS Law Enforcement databases based on the IWS EPI Suite program. This program allows integration with various IWS databases for the production of unique booking/inmate reports, wristbands, photo ID cards, Wanted or BOLO fliers, etc., created from the information stored in booking records. Designs can be created in minutes and quickly added to the IWS Law Enforcement system, allowing all users with appropriate permissions immediate access to the newly added form.

  Maintenance and Customer Support
  
 We offer software and hardware support to our customers. Customers can contract with us for technical support that enables them to use a toll-free number to speak with our technical support center for software support and general assistance 24 hours a day, seven days a week. As many of our government customers operate around the clock and perceive our systems as critical to their day-to-day operations, a very high percentage contract for technical support.  For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, maintenance revenue accounted for approximately 60% and 62% of our total revenue, respectively.
 Software Customization and Fulfillment
  
 We directly employ computer programmers and retain independent programmers to develop our software and perform quality control. We provide customers with software that we specifically customize to operate on their existing computer system. We work directly with purchasers of our system to ensure that the system they purchase will meet their unique needs. We configure and test the system either at our facilities or on-site and conduct any customized programming necessary to connect the system with any legacy systems already in place. We can also provide customers with a complete computer hardware system with our software already installed and configured. In either case, the customer is provided with a complete turnkey solution, which can be used immediately. When we provide our customers with a complete solution including hardware, we use off-the-shelf computers, cameras and other components purchased from other companies such as Dell or Hewlett Packard. Systems are assembled and configured either at our facilities or at the customer’s location.
 Customers
  
 We have a wide variety of domestic and international customers. Most of our IWS Law Enforcement customers are government agencies at the federal, state and local levels in the United States. Our secure credential products are also being used in Australia, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines. For the year ended December 31, 2018, one customer accounted for approximately 36% or $1,573,000 of total revenue and had $0 trade receivables as of the end of the year, as compared to one customer that accounted for approximately 25% or $1,089,000 of total revenue and had $201,000 trade receivables as of the end of the December 31, 2017.
 Our Strategy
  
 Our strategy is to provide patented open-architected identity management solutions including multi-biometric, secure credential and law enforcement technologies that are stand alone, integrated and/or bundled with key partners including channel relationships and large systems integrators such as United Technology Security, GCR, Unisys, Lockheed Martin, IBM and Fujitsu, among others. Key elements of our strategy for growth include the following:
 Fully Exploit the Biometrics, Access Control and Identification Markets
  
 The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security coupled with the movement by governments around the world to authenticate the identity of their citizens, employees and contractors has accelerated the adoption of biometric identification systems that can provide secure credentials and instant access to centrally maintained records for real-time verification of identity and access (physical and logical) privileges. Using our products, an organization can create secure credentials that correspond to records, including images and biographic data, in a digital database. A border guard or customs agent can stop an individual to quickly and accurately verify his identity against a database of authorized persons, and either allow or deny access as required. Our technology is also standards based and applied to facilitate activities such as federal identification mandates while complying with personal identification verification standards such as HSPD-12, International Civil Aviation Organization standards, American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators driver licenses, voter registration, immigration control and welfare fraud identification. We believe that these or very similar standards are applicable in markets throughout the world.
  
 With the identity management market growing at a rapid pace, biometric identifiers are becoming recognized and accepted as integral components to the identification process in the public and private sectors. As biometric technologies (facial recognition, fingerprint, iris, etc.) are adopted, identification systems must be updated to enable their use in the field. We have built our solutions to enable the incorporation of one or multiple biometrics, which can be associated with a record and stored both in a database and on a card for later retrieval and verification without regard to the specific hardware employed. We believe the increasing demand for biometric technology will drive demand for our solutions. Our identity management products are built to accommodate the use of biometrics and meet the demanding requirements across the entire identity life cycle.

  Expand Law Enforcement and Public Safety Markets
  
 We intend to use our successful installations with customers such as the Arizona Department of Public Safety and the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department as reference accounts, and to market IWS Law Enforcement as a superior technological solution. Our recent addition of the LiveScan module and support for local AFIS to our IWS Law Enforcement will enhance its functionality and value to the law enforcement customer as well as increase the potential revenue the Company can generate from a system sale. We primarily sell directly to the law enforcement community. Our sales strategy is to increase sales to new and existing customers, including renewing supporting maintenance agreements. We have also established relationships with large systems integrators such as Sagem Morpho to OEM our law enforcement solution utilizing their worldwide sales force. We will focus our sales efforts in the near term to establish IWS Law Enforcement as the integrated mug shot and LiveScan system adopted in as many countries, states, large counties and municipalities as possible. Once we have a system installed in a region, we intend to then sell additional systems or retrieval seats to other agencies within the primary customer’s region and in neighboring regions. In addition, we plan to market our integrated investigative modules to the customer, including Facial Recognition, Web and WitnessView. As customer databases of digital mug shots grow, we expect that the perceived value of our investigative modules, and corresponding revenue from sales of those modules, will also grow.
 Software as a Service Business Model
  
 With the advent of cloud-based computing and the proliferation of smart mobile devices, which allow for reliable biometric capture and the need to secure access to data, products and services, the Company believes that the market for multi-biometric solutions will expand to encompass significant deployments of biometric systems in the commercial and consumer markets. The Company therefore intends to leverage the strength of its experience servicing existing government clients who have deployed the Company’s products for large populations, as well as its foundational patent portfolio in the field of multi-modal biometrics and the fusion of multiple biometric algorithms, to address the growing commercial and consumer market. As part of its marketing plan, the Company offered new versions of its product suite on a SaaS model during 2016. This new business model, which is intended to supplement the Company’s existing business model, will allow new commercial and consumer clients to biometrically verify identity in order to access data, products or services from mobile and desktop devices.
 Mobile Applications
  
 The Company strengthened its patent portfolio in June 2012 with the purchase of four U.S. patents relating to wireless technology from Vocel. These patents, combined with the Company’s existing foundational patents in the areas of biometric identification, verification, enrollment and fusion, provide a unique and protected foundation on which to build interactive mobile applications that are secured using biometrics.
  
 The combination of our biometric identification technologies and wireless technologies has led to the development of the IWS Interactive Messaging System, which is a push application platform secured by biometrics that transforms mobile devices into a complete mobile ID, enabling companies to create applications that allow a range of unprecedented activities, from secure sharing of sensitive information to biometrically securing a mobile wallet. Identity authentication, using multi-modal biometrics gives users the confidence that their personal information is secure while the push marketing capabilities of the technology allow companies unparalleled interactivity that can be personalized to the needs and interests of their customers.
  
  Sales and Marketing
  
 We market and sell our products through our direct sales force and through indirect distribution channels, including systems integrators. As of December 31, 2018, we had sales and account representatives based domestically in the District of Columbia, California, Colorado, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Illinois and internationally in Japan, Chile and Mexico. Geographically, our sales and marketing force consisted of thirteen persons: ten persons in the United States, and three persons internationally as of December 31, 2018.
  
 Our direct sales organization is supported by technical experts. Our technical experts are available by telephone and conduct on-site customer presentations in support of our sales professionals.
  
 The typical sales cycle for IWS Biometric Engine and IWS Law Enforcement includes a pre-sale process to define the potential customer’s needs and budget, an on-site demonstration and conversations between the potential customer and existing customers. Government agencies are typically required to purchase large systems by including a list of requirements in a Request for Proposal, known as an “RFP,” and by allowing several companies to openly bid for the project by responding to the RFP. If our response is selected, we enter into negotiations for the contract and, if successful, ultimately receive a purchase order from the customer. This process can take anywhere from a few months to over a year.

 Our Biometric and ID products are also sold to large integrators, direct via our sales force and to end users through distributors. Depending on the customer’s requirements, there may be instances that require an RFP. The sales cycle can vary from a few weeks to a year.
  
 In addition to our direct sales force, we have developed relationships with a number of systems integrators who contract with government agencies for the installation and integration of large computer and communication systems. By acting as a subcontractor to these systems integrators, we are able to avoid the time consuming and often-expensive task of submitting proposals to government agencies, and we also gain access to large clients.
  
 We also work with companies that offer complementary products, where value is created through product integration. Through teaming arrangements, we are able to enhance our products and to expand our customer base through the relationships and contracts of our strategic partners.
  
 We plan to continue to market and sell our products internationally. Some of the challenges and risks associated with international sales include the difficulty in protecting our intellectual property rights, difficulty in enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems and volatility and unpredictability in the political and economic conditions of foreign countries. We believe we can work to successfully overcome these challenges.
  
  Competition
  
  The Law Enforcement and Public Safety Markets
  
 Due to the fragmented nature of the law enforcement and public safety market and the modular nature of our product suite, we face different degrees of competition with respect to each IWS Law Enforcement module. We believe the principal bases on which we compete with respect to all of our products are:
  
  ●
  the unique ability to integrate our modular products into a complete biometric, LiveScan, imaging and investigative system;

 
  ●
  our reputation as a reliable systems supplier;

 
  ●
  the usability and functionality of our products; and

 
  ●
  the responsiveness, availability and reliability of our customer support.

 
 Our law enforcement product line faces competition from other companies such as DataWorks Plus and 3M. Internationally, there are often a number of local companies offering solutions in most countries.
  
  Secure Credential Market
  
 Due to the breadth of our software offering in the secure credential market space, we face differing degrees of competition in certain market segments. The strength of our competitive position is based upon:
  
  ●
  our strong brand reputation with a customer base, which includes small and medium-sized businesses, Fortune 500 corporations and large government agencies;

 
  ●
  the ease of integrating our technology into other complex applications; and

 
  ●
  the leveraged strength that comes from offering customers software tools, packaged solutions and web-based service applications that support a wide range of hardware peripherals.

 
 Our software faces competition from Datacard Corporation, a privately held manufacturer of hardware, software and consumables for the ID market, as well as small, regionally based companies.
  
  Biometric Market
  
 The market to provide biometric systems to the identity management market is evolving and we face competition from a number of sources. We believe that the strength of our competitive position is based on:
  
   ●
  our ability to provide a system which enables the enrollment, management and authentication of multiple biometrics managing population databases of unlimited sizes;

 
   ●
  searches can be 1:1 (verification), 1:N (identification), X:N (investigative), and N:N (database integrity); and

 
   ●
  the system is technology and biometric agnostic, enabling the use of biometric devices and algorithms from any vendor, and the support of the following biometric types: finger, face, iris, hand geometry, palm, DNA, signature, voice, 3D face and retina.

 Our multi-biometric product faces competition from French-based Safran, Irish-based Daon, 3M and Aware Inc., none of which have offerings with the scope and flexibility of our IWS Biometric Engine and its companion suite of products or relevant patent protection.
   
  Intellectual Property
  
 We rely on trademark, patent, trade secret and copyright laws and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our intellectual property. We have several federally registered trademarks, including the trademark ImageWare and IWS Biometric Engine, as well as trademarks for which there are pending trademark registrations with the United States, Canadian and other International Patent & Trademark Offices.
  
 We hold several issued patents and have several other patent applications pending for elements of our products. We believe we have the foundational patents regarding the use of multiple biometrics and continue to be an IP leader in the biometric arena. It is our belief that this intellectual property leadership will create a sustainable competitive advantage. We are an early pioneer in the first to file patents related to multi-modal biometrics and currently are the worldwide leader in multi-modal biometric patents, with 22 issued patents worldwide and 25 patents pending. These technologies allow biometric matching using any type of biometric modality for identity verification while protecting the privacy of an individual. It is our belief that such technology will be critical to providing biometric management solutions for the consumer market where privacy protection has been a historical issue and barrier to biometric adoption.
  
 The Company strengthened its patent portfolio in June 2012 with the purchase of four U.S. patents relating to wireless technology from Vocel. These patents, combined with the Company’s existing foundational patents in the areas of biometric identification, verification, enrollment and fusion, provide a unique and protected foundation on which to build interactive mobile applications that are secured using biometrics.
  
 We regard our software as proprietary and retain title to and ownership of the software we develop. We attempt to protect our rights in the software primarily through patents and trade secrets. We have not published the source code of most of our software products and require employees and other third parties who have access to the source code and other trade secret information to sign confidentiality agreements acknowledging our ownership and the nature of these materials as our trade secrets.
  
 Despite these precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized parties to copy or reverse-engineer portions of our products. Although our competitive position could be threatened by disclosure or reverse engineering of this proprietary information, we believe that copyright and trademark protection are less important than other factors, such as the knowledge, ability, and experience of our personnel, name recognition and ongoing product development and support.
  
 Our software products are licensed to end users under a perpetual, nontransferable, nonexclusive license that stipulates which modules can be used and how many concurrent users may use them. These forms of licenses are typically not signed by the licensee and may be more difficult to enforce than signed agreements in some jurisdictions.
  
  Employees
  
 We had a total of 73 and 64 full-time employees as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
 Environmental Regulation
  
 Our business does not require us to comply with any particular environmental regulations.
