Unless otherwise indicated in this Annual Report, references to the “Company,” “Snap One,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Snap One Holdings Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Our Vision
Bringing together people, integrators and products to deliver joy, connectivity and security in our everyday lives.
Our Company
Snap One powers smart living by enabling professional integrators to deliver seamless experiences in the connected homes and businesses where people live, work and play. We offer an end-to-end product ecosystem delivered through our powerful distribution network and further bolstered by our value-added services and workflow solutions. Collectively, we refer to this compelling value proposition as our “Only Here” strategy, delivering a differentiated experience to our loyal and growing network of approximately 20,000 professional do-it-for-me (“DIFM”) integrators. We believe our Only Here value proposition becomes embedded into integrators’ workflow throughout the project lifecycle, creating re-occurring spending patterns that strengthen our integrator relationships and enhance our revenue visibility across our integrator base.
We are vertically integrated, with the majority of our net sales coming from our proprietary-branded, internally developed products. These proprietary products are manufactured on an asset-light basis through our network of contract manufacturing and joint development suppliers located primarily in Asia. We have complemented our proprietary product portfolio with a curated set of leading third-party product brands to deliver an end-to-end product ecosystem that provides professional integrators with a “one-stop shop” experience at Snap One.
Our proprietary software solutions enhance the interoperability of our products and enable our emerging portfolio of value-added, subscription-based services. As we expand our penetration of connected homes and businesses, we expect to continue to invest in the expansion of existing and development of new subscription-based services. We believe our leadership position and expanding presence in the home and business will allow us to develop new high margin, recurring software driven services that enhance our product suite and bolster our underlying software. We expect to continue to develop technologies to make integrators more effective and efficient, which is critical to delivering the best solutions for our integrators and end consumers.
We support our integrators with a comprehensive suite of software and support workflow solutions. We engage with our integrators on an omni-channel basis, blending the benefits of our comprehensive e-commerce portal with the convenience of our local branch network for same-day product availability. We support our integrators throughout the entire lifecycle of their projects from pre-sale product research and system design to post-installation end consumer support via our proprietary OvrC software, which enables integrators to remotely manage, configure and troubleshoot devices in the field. Our OvrC software platform powers our Parasol service offering, which provides end consumers with 24x7 remote support service while creating operational efficiency for our integrators by reducing the customer service workload (“Parasol Services”). We believe our solutions make it easier for professional integrators to operate and profitably grow their businesses, contributing to increased retention and wallet share growth with us over time. 
Our Market Opportunity
The growing global residential and commercial technology market is comprised of Do-It-Yourself (“DIY”) and Do-It-For-Me (“DIFM”) solutions. The DIFM sub-market that we serve is distinct from the DIY sub-market, and is characterized by consumers with higher service expectations, more complicated projects, higher income, and increased reliance on service professionals in other parts of their lives. DIFM consumers typically spend $10,000 to $20,000 for professional integrators to design, select the best products, and install and configure these systems. Each of these projects represents an opportunity for Snap One to provide the products the integrator needs to service their customers.
Our network currently consists of approximately 20,000 of the over 70,000 domestic DIFM integrators across the home technology, security, and commercial markets. Within the over 70,000 total domestic DIFM integrators, 
approximately 17,500 are home technology focused, approximately 20,000 are security focused and approximately 32,500 are commercial focused. Consumers’ increasing desire to have an integrated, easy-to-use system is expected to drive continued demand for DIFM solutions across the home technology, security, and commercial markets. In addition, we believe the market for continued geographic expansion represents a significant opportunity for Snap One given our modest presence outside the United States today.
Our Differentiated Solution
We believe our integrated platform of products, software, and support solutions that are embedded into the integrator’s workflow is unmatched in the industry. We simplify the challenges associated with designing a smart living system and enable our integrators to create optimal solutions that are cohesive, functional, and efficient. Every decision we make is through the lens of helping integrators run their businesses more efficiently while delivering immersive smart living experiences. This results in a long-term partnership in our shared mission to bring joy, connectivity and security into end consumers’ everyday lives.
Our End-to-End Product Ecosystem
We provide integrators with a leading, comprehensive suite of connected, infrastructure, entertainment, and software solutions so the entire smart living experience is exceptional for the end consumer. Our product and service offerings encompass all of the design elements required by integrators to build integrated smart living systems that are easy to install and simple to manage, serving the needs of both integrators and end consumers. Our deep relationships with our individual integrators provide us the real-time feedback that allows us to continuously improve our offerings.
•Proprietary Products and Software. We have developed a broad range of proprietary products that encompass the spectrum of solutions needed to deliver integrated smart living systems. These products and software are sold under our proprietary brands such as Araknis, Control4, and Wattbox with confidential wholesale prices that allow integrators to maintain their profitability. Our products and software are designed to meet the unique needs of both the integrator and the DIFM end consumer. We do this by delivering a high quality and reliable cross-category integrated solution that connects easily to our proprietary solutions and third-party products. In addition, our solutions have built-in firmware to allow for a high degree of configurability with useful management tools, which make it easy for integrators to provide mission critical post-installation support. Through our proprietary software, Control4 OS3 and OvrC, we allow integration with thousands of products manufactured by hundreds of third-party manufacturers, and our products are compatible with connected devices from leading brands such as Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Samsung, Sony, Sonos, and Yamaha allowing end consumers to enjoy and control their integrated system with the products and devices they know and love.
•Third-Party Products. In addition to our proprietary solutions, we have a curated set of leading third-party products from brands such as Alphabet, Amazon, KEF, Klipsch, Lutron, Samsung, Sony, Sonos, Ubiquiti and Yamaha, which provide our integrators a one-stop shop for their product needs. We believe this increases the value we deliver to our integrators, grows the usage of our workflow solutions, and drives integrator retention and growth. Our third-party product offerings also deliver significant value to our third-party partners. We provide these third-party partners with differentiated access to our expansive network of integrators through our omni-channel model and compatibility with our leading software solutions, which enables these products to be seamlessly integrated into a system and easily supported after installation.
Our Software and Support Workflow Solutions
Our differentiated technology and software workflow tools have been designed to support the integrator throughout the project lifecycle, enhancing their operations and helping them to profitably grow their businesses. We believe our suite of embedded solutions is truly unique, further differentiating Snap One from the rest of the smart living market, and driving stickiness and wallet share growth with our integrators.
▪Integrator Job Lifecycle Service and Support. We provide comprehensive certification and award-winning training and support services, enabling integrators’ ongoing success and business efficiency. Our comprehensive services are delivered through multiple channels, including through our cloud software, on our e-commerce portal and at our local branches, and encompass the integrator job lifecycle from research and training through post-
installation support. For example, we have remote management solutions that enable continuous end consumer system monitoring and management and significantly reduce or eliminate time-consuming and costly post-installation troubleshooting for the integrator. Additionally, we have a dedicated team of technical experts who help integrators with product awareness, product training and on-the-job troubleshooting support to ensure the best solutions are delivered in the right way to end consumers. We believe the 17 CE Pro Quest for Quality Awards we won in 2022 are a testament to the value of our service and support programs for integrators.
▪Cloud-Based Software. We have developed a suite of proprietary cloud-based software solutions that are embedded in the integrator’s workflow through the project lifecycle and enable remote management and monitoring of connected devices after installation. Our Control4 Composer tool provides an easy-to-use interface that helps integrators configure highly customized control systems for end consumers. OvrC is a cloud-based software, which enables integrators to remotely monitor, troubleshoot and manage connected devices on a system. While basic OvrC functionality is generally available free to most integrators, OvrC provides a foundation for premium services such as Parasol Services, our subscription-based 24X7 remote support service for end consumers. By utilizing these software tools, integrators can significantly increase efficiency by reducing the need for service calls and ensuring that their customers’ mission-critical systems are installed properly and supported thereafter, resulting in continuous highly personalized, immersive experiences.
▪Omni-Channel Model. We provide a comprehensive e-commerce portal for smart living, which is tailored to allow integrators to research products, design projects, receive training and certifications, order products, and solicit ongoing support. It provides targeted content and compelling stories to drive meaningful interactions with integrators who typically visit the portal an average of ten times to research, train, design, and build an estimate for each purchase they ultimately make. We supplement our e-commerce portal with a growing footprint of 41 North American branch locations as of December 30, 2022. These local branches are key to supporting our growth strategy and delivering additional value to integrators by ensuring they can receive critical products on a same-day basis to support project requirements, while attending in-person trainings and using local demonstration rooms to test new products.
The integration of our end-to-end product and software ecosystem and support workflow drives industry-leading efficiency for our integrators. We believe we set the industry standard for ease of use for integrators, which drives loyalty and increased use of our platform over time.
Our Integrated Platform and Services
Our end-to-end product, software and services create an integrated platform of leading offerings, which drives significant value for our integrators and personalized, immersive experiences for end consumers.
Our Products
We sell products under exclusive brands, as well as leading third-party products, to provide our end consumers with personalized smart living solutions. Our products are designed to meet the needs of professional integrators and the distinct consumer segment they serve by delivering reliability, a high degree of configurability, useful management tools and great experiences that delight consumers and make it easy for integrators to provide post-installation support. Our comprehensive proprietary and third-party product portfolio provides a one-stop shop experience for our integrators, with particular strength in home technology and demonstrated success in commercial and security. Over the years, integrators have come to us knowing they can benefit from our superior value proposition through access to our leading proprietary products, as well as a selection of the best third-party products in the marketplace. We believe our mutually beneficial relationships with third-party partners differentiate us from others in the industry.
Our product portfolio extends across the Connected, Entertainment and Infrastructure product categories:
•Connected. We provide technology products that connect to the network and directly enable the personalized experiences that our end consumers desire, and our Connected portfolio is enhanced by our proprietary software offerings that enable the integration and remote management of installed systems. End consumers directly interface with these connected solutions via touch panels, remotes and lighting keypads. Our Connected product portfolio includes networking, control and lighting, surveillance and power.
•Entertainment. We provide a range of high-quality Entertainment products for indoor and outdoor solutions to deliver immersive experiences for end consumers. Our Entertainment products are designed to deliver on the desired end consumer expectations while also providing ease of use and installation efficiency for our integrators. Our outdoor Entertainment products contain specialized features, including weatherization, to enrich backyard experiences for our end consumers. Our Entertainment product portfolio includes audio and video products and media distribution.
•Infrastructure. Our Infrastructure products are foundational to every installation. These products are typically behind-the-wall or less visible to the end consumer than the rest of our product portfolio. Accordingly, our Infrastructure products are often an integrator preference item, so we engineer our solutions with reliability, ease of installation and integrator workflow in mind. Our Infrastructure product portfolio includes structured wiring and cables, racks and mounts.
Our Software Solutions
Our software solutions enable our integrators to provide personalized connected systems for end consumers. Our proprietary OvrC system provides integrators with a cloud-based remote management and monitoring solution that enables integrators to troubleshoot connected devices and systems remotely. Integrators can now efficiently support and update installed systems without making an on-site visit. This saves the integrator time and money and enables a timelier resolution improving end consumers’ satisfaction. In addition, we offer our OvrC Connect software to end consumers, which provides them with the ability to manage their systems and resolve common problems independently. For instance, with OvrC Connect, a consumer can reset their Wattbox power outlets and troubleshoot system issues without physically accessing the products or calling professional support. This provides value and convenience to end consumers.
Additionally, our Control4 OS3 system is our leading product for command and control of smart living systems. We have expanded our control platform capabilities and meaningfully enhanced the end consumer experience through the integration of audio, video, lighting, temperature, security, communications, voice and other functionalities throughout the home.
Our OvrC and Control4 OS3 software provide the foundation supporting the pillars of our growth strategy, which we have built upon to launch and monetize value-added services for end consumers. We have an identified pipeline of growth opportunities where we can leverage our existing software to create unique subscription-based solutions that generate recurring revenue. We currently have two subscription-based services that we sell to residential and commercial end consumers. Our Parasol Services are enabled by our OvrC software that provides end consumers with 24x7 remote support to troubleshoot devices on their network. 4Sight is enabled by our Control4 OS3 software and provides end consumers with enhanced access and personalization of their systems.
Our Services Support the Entire Integrator Job Lifecycle
•Research and Learn. Integrators utilize our e-commerce portal for research and learning. We offer extensive product descriptions, specifications, education, videos, supporting documents and solutions-based merchandising to allow integrators to research different options for their projects. We further leverage our local branch footprint to host training events and product demonstrations in certain geographic markets.
•System Design and Quote. Our design tools give integrators access to technical drawings and CAD files to ensure they are selecting the right products for the application. These tools enhance integrator efficiency and provide continuity for integrators to convert quotes to product orders under our confidential integrator pricing that protects their profitability.
•Order and Fulfillment. We provide out integrators with the convenience to order and receive products on an omni-channel basis. Our nationwide distribution network allows us to efficiently serve integrators through reliable delivery, while our local branch network provides integrators with same-day product availability to keep projects on track
•Install, Set-Up and Program. We have award-winning support services available through our online portal. In addition to our robust catalog of online content, our product support technicians serve as an outsourced technical team that supports our integrators’ success. In addition, our Control4 Composer software tool provides an intuitive interface that enables integrators to efficiently configure systems during installation.
•Business Administration. Integrators can use our platform to access invoices, track orders, view customer order history and manage returns. Through these various points of interaction with our integrators, we have a robust data set, which we analyze to target promotions and identify cross-selling and up-selling opportunities.
•Ongoing Support. We provide our integrators with on-going monitoring capabilities so they can deliver superior service to their customers. Our OvrC offering, the remote management and monitoring platform for integrators, creates increased efficiency, as integrators can monitor systems and fix any issues remotely, reducing the need for inefficient service calls. 
Our Software and Product Development
We have a robust R&D organization that focuses on the development of new products, software, and technology-driven workflow solutions as well as the enhancement of our existing solutions. Our product and software development process fosters an innovation feedback loop whereby we leverage end consumer and integrator feedback to continually enhance existing solutions. Through our joint-development model, we partner with manufacturers to reliably and rapidly bring new product technology to market and reduce the risk of R&D investment. We focus our internal product development efforts on the application of these leading technologies to the specific challenges faced by integrators and their customers. Our strategy of “fast following” major technology standards while investing in differentiation for the integrator allows us to maintain market-leading products with an efficient, innovative, and capital-light organization. We believe our products are the best-of-breed in their respective categories. We expect to continue to invest substantial resources in R&D to expand our integrated platform of products, software, and workflow solutions.
Omni-Channel Distribution and Manufacturing
Our nationwide distribution network allows us to service integrators through reliable delivery and local fulfillment. Our proprietary products are received at one of our five strategically located U.S. distribution centers, along with a selection of third-party products, which allows our integrators to bundle their purchases for an entire job with one partner either through our leading e-commerce site or for local purchase and or pickup at one of our 39 domestic local branches as of December 30, 2022. These local branches are key to delivering additional value to our integrators, as we can in many cases provide same-day delivery of products that integrators may require for projects. Same-day delivery can be mission critical for integrators as the lack of any one component can stall a project. Our local branches are more than fulfillment centers as they also provide value-added services to integrators throughout the project lifecycle.
In addition to our internal capabilities, we partner with a network of contract manufacturing and joint development suppliers to produce our proprietary products. Our supply chain teams, both in the United States and in Asia, partner closely with our suppliers through design, sourcing, quality validation and logistics to ensure high quality, high availability products for our integrators. The majority of our proprietary product production cost is with Asia-based suppliers. We maintain contractual and operational safeguards designed to align with our suppliers and ensure high standards of quality. In addition to the work we do with our supplier partners, we perform full custom manufacturing of our Triad speaker line in Portland, Oregon along with light assembly of certain products at our distribution locations.
Over the past several years, our global supply chain operations, including component sourcing, shipping, and logistics, have experienced impacts related to COVID-19 and the various associated regulatory responses, similar to other companies in our industry. These impacts resulted in delayed product availability in some cases. Although some supply chain issues have stabilized, we expect these impacts, including potential delayed product availability, to continue for as long as the global supply chain is experiencing these challenges, and we continue to invest in supply chain initiatives to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 related issues.
Sales and Marketing
Our e-commerce portals are the heart of our marketing and sales strategy. Our strategy is to make these portals the primary place for integrators to research products, design projects, receive training and certifications, order products and receive ongoing support. We drive engagement with integrators via digital marketing campaigns, a multi-faceted integrator rewards program, high-quality content, and digital tools for training, research, management and other integrator needs.
To supplement this portal, we have invested in a multi-faceted sales and marketing organization that allocates effort across our channel based on the opportunity size of the integrator. We operate our sales effort through a combination of local branch sales personnel, outside sales representatives, and in-house sales development resources. In addition, our strong partner rewards program allows us to drive new integrator additions and increase integrator spend by providing spending and loyalty-based rewards such as free shipping, discounted pricing, advanced replacements and quarterly rebates.
We are active participants at global industry conferences and maintain a significant presence at Custom Electronics Design and Installation Association (“CEDIA”) trade shows.
Our Competition
The smart living market is fragmented, highly competitive and continually evolving. We compete against smart living point product companies such as Alarm.com, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Crestron, Logitech, Savant, Sonos and Ubiquiti. Many of these companies have significant market share, diversified product and service lines, well-established supply and distribution systems, strong worldwide brand recognition, loyal customer bases and significant financial, marketing, research, development and other resources. Their presence in the market has increased consumer awareness for smart living solutions and has helped contribute to the robust growth of the entire market and demand for our integrated solutions. In a number of cases, our competitors are also our partners within our third-party product ecosystem, and their products are purchased by integrators through Snap One. We also compete with distributors in local markets who distribute similar products to professional integrators.
We expect to encounter new competitors as we enter new markets as well as increased competition, both domestically and internationally, from other established and emerging smart-living-focused businesses. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties and rapidly acquire significant market share. In particular, we may in the future compete with large technology companies that offer control capabilities among their products, applications and services, and have ongoing development efforts to address the broader smart living market. Such companies may have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution or other resources, and greater name recognition than we do. In some instances, we may have commercial arrangements with technology or services providers in the connected home market with whom we may otherwise compete and our relationships with both our competitors and partners may change over time.
We believe the principal competitive factors in the smart living market include the following:
•Simplicity and ease-of-use for both the integrator and end consumer;
•Ability to offer a broad suite of products and comprehensive solutions;
•Ability to provide efficient and timely distribution on an omni-channel basis;
•Ability to provide secure access to wireless networks;
•Ability to offer persistent awareness, control and intelligent automation;
•Ability to provide quality product support;
•Flexibility of the solutions and ability to customize for the end consumer;
•Interoperability with a wide range of third-party devices;
•Pricing, affordability and accessibility;
•Network of integrators with local installation capabilities; and
•Brand awareness and reputation.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors. In addition, we believe that our integrated platform of products and technology-enabled workflow solutions help to set us apart from our competitors.
Our Intellectual Property
Our success and ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and to establish and adequately protect our intellectual property rights. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality agreements, licenses and intellectual property assignment agreements. We maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our proprietary information. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we therefore may be unable to protect our proprietary technology in certain jurisdictions.
As of December 30, 2022, we had over 100 granted patents and over 100 trademarks protecting our proprietary brands. We continue to review our product development and efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We also enter into commercial arrangements with our third-party product partners to provide integration with our ecosystem and sell their products through our e-commerce portal and local branch network.
Human Capital
Our employees are central to our vision of “bringing together people, integrators and products to deliver joy, connectivity and security in our everyday lives.” Everything we do begins with our people, and recruiting, developing and investing in top talent is critical to our success.
As of December 30, 2022, we had 1,652 full-time employees, including 370 in product development, 479 in sales and marketing, 594 in operations and 209 in general and administrative. Of the 370 employees on our product development team, 183 were software engineers. Of our full-time employees, 1,398 were in the United States and 254 were in our international locations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and/or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages.
We strive to foster a positive, collaborative and inclusive working environment that enables our people to thrive and our integrators to succeed. That is why we ask every person who joins Snap One to embrace our four company tenets:
•Be an Owner.
•Obsess over Customers.
•Be the Best Place to Work.
•Learn Every Day.
Consistent with our tenets, Snap One values diversity and belonging. Our solutions integrate thousands of unique products into smart homes and businesses, and similarly we believe that a truly innovative workforce should integrate employees with varied knowledge, experience and backgrounds to best promote innovation and growth. We rely on the differences in who we are, how we think and what we have experienced to create a greater sense of community. For example, our inclusion groups are Company-sponsored groups of employees that support and promote certain mutual objectives of both the employees and the Company, including inclusion and diversity and the professional development of employees. We also have a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council to promote our shared vision of equality and belonging. Our emphasis on treating people well creates an attractive culture for our employees and enables us to create exceptional experiences for our customers.
We strive to provide our employees with career-development opportunities and resources that enable them to grow professionally. This helps us to attract and retain a talented and diverse workforce by deepening employee engagement and enhancing the skills and competencies of our people. We use skills matrices in which employees’ demonstration of our Company tenets is assessed against the expectations for their current level of responsibility within the Company and potential future roles. Employees and their managers use the results of this assessment to evaluate the employees’ readiness to take on additional responsibility, to create and communicate individual development plans for employees and to identify opportunities that will position them for future professional growth. We supplement our rigorous criteria for assessing employees’ readiness for a promotion with input from a variety of sources, and we seek to create growth opportunities that go beyond promotions.
Our Focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance Principles
Attention to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues is integral to our business strategy and our culture. We believe that being a good environmental and social citizen is not just the right thing to do as a responsible member of the communities we serve but is also the right thing to do to drive long-term value creation. Our mission to make lives more enjoyable, connected, and secure is powered by a commitment to people, privacy and the planet. In 2022, we created a cross-functional ESG Committee, with representation from our People, Product, Supply Chain, Finance, Legal, and IT teams, to assist in establishing and implementing our ESG strategy and drive alignment of our business and ESG objectives. The ESG strategic focus areas that we believe offer the greatest opportunity for us to drive meaningful impacts and create value are organized under four cornerstone ESG principles: Governance, People, Product, and Planet. Our commitment to these principles is driven by the following high-level goals:
•Ethical Company: Commit to governance practices and policies that promote high ethical standards and maximize the long-term interests of our stakeholders (Governance). 
•Employer of Choice: Create safer environments and more equitable and inclusive employee experiences (People). 
•Engaged Leader: Create solutions that enable resource efficiency and enhance data security and privacy for end customers and partners (Product). 
•Environmental Steward: Meaningfully reduce our impact on the environment by reducing our carbon footprint and improving sustainability of operations (Planet). 
With the leadership from our board and ESG Committee, our Company will continue to develop and adapt our ESG and business strategies to align with these goals.
