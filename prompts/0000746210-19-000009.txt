Item 1. Business
Overview
Glowpoint, Inc. (“Glowpoint” or “we” or “us” or the “Company”) is a managed service provider of video collaboration and network applications. Our services are designed to provide a comprehensive suite of automated and concierge applications to simplify the user experience and expedite the adoption of video as the primary means of collaboration. Our customers include Fortune 1000 companies, along with small and medium enterprises in a variety of industries. We market our services globally through a multi-channel sales approach that includes direct sales and channel partners. The Company was formed as a Delaware corporation in May 2000. The Company operates in one segment and therefore segment information is not presented.

The Company has experienced declines in revenue in each of the last five fiscal years. From fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2018, we experienced a decline in revenue from $33.5 million in 2013 to $12.6 million in 2018. These revenue declines are primarily due to net attrition of customers and lower demand for our services given the competitive environment and pressure on pricing that exists in our industry. During the past several years, we had limited resources to invest in product development and sales and marketing in order to reverse the Company’s revenue trends. We reduced our sales and marketing expenses from $2,047,000 in 2015 to $664,000 in 2016, $413,000 in 2017 and $319,000 in 2018, in an effort to improve EBITDA and cash flow from operations and maintain compliance with financial covenants under our previously-existing loan agreements.
On January 25, 2018, the Company closed a registered direct offering of 1,750 shares of 0% Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”) for net proceeds of $1,527,000 (the “Series C Offering”). On January 26, 2018, the Company terminated the Business Loan and Security Agreement, dated July 31, 2017, by and between the Company and Super G Capital LLC (“Super G”), along with the accompanying Warrant to Purchase Shares of Common Stock, dated July 31, 2017, and paid off all remaining debt obligations with Super G (the “Super G Payoff”). Also, during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company paid off all remaining debt with Western Alliance Bank.
As previously disclosed, on July 5, 2018, we received a letter (the “Deficiency Letter”) from the NYSE American stating that we were not in compliance with the continued listing standards as set forth in Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the “Company Guide”). Specifically, the Deficiency Letter informed us that the NYSE American has determined that shares of our common stock have been selling for a low price per share for a substantial period of time and, pursuant to Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company Guide, the continued listing of our common stock on the NYSE American is predicated on us effecting a reverse stock split of our common stock or otherwise demonstrating sustained price improvement within a reasonable period of time, which the NYSE American subsequently determined to be no later than the date of our annual meeting in May 2019. We intend to regain compliance with the listing standards set forth in the Company Guide on the timeline established by the NYSE American by undertaking a measure or measures that are for the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Specifically, given the many conditions to the closing of the Merger discussed below, we are currently working to implement, in the near future, a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report for more information regarding this proposed reverse stock split. While there can be no assurances that a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding Common Stock will be implemented in the near future, we expect that either such an interim reverse stock split or the reverse stock split expected to be implemented in connection with the proposed Merger (as discussed below) will allow the Company to regain compliance with this continued listing standard. However, there can be no guaranty that any such reverse stock split will be effected on the terms disclosed herein or at all, or that such measures will be successful or that the NYSE American will deem the company to be in compliance.
On October 24, 2018, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent with SharedLabs, Inc. (“SharedLabs”), a privately held global software and technology services company located in Jacksonville, Florida, with respect to the proposed acquisition by us of 100% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of SharedLabs in exchange for shares of our Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”).
On December 20, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Glowpoint Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Glowpoint (the “Merger Sub”), and SharedLabs. The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (i) Glowpoint will effect a reverse stock split of its shares of Common Stock, at a ratio to be approved by Glowpoint’s stockholders and board of directors, and which ratio, as set forth in the Merger Agreement, will not be greater than 1-for-30 without SharedLabs’ approval; (ii) the Merger Sub will merge with and into SharedLabs (the “Merger”), with SharedLabs surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Glowpoint; and (iii) in connection therewith, each share of capital stock of SharedLabs issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the Merger (other than Excluded Shares (as 
-3-

defined in the Merger Agreement)) will be converted into the right to receive shares of Glowpoint’s Common Stock (the “Merger Consideration”). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger Consideration will consist of shares of Common Stock, subject to certain adjustments based upon the completion by SharedLabs of a private placement of equity securities for at least $5 million of net cash proceeds (the “SharedLabs Equity Financing”), the execution of one or more term sheets by SharedLabs with lending institutions for one or more credit facilities aggregating not less than $16 million in borrowing capacity subject to a maximum interest rate (the “SharedLabs Term Sheet”), and the working capital of each of Glowpoint and SharedLabs at closing compared to a target working capital for each of Glowpoint and SharedLabs. Warrants to purchase shares of SharedLabs common stock that remain outstanding as of the Effective Time will be converted into warrants to purchase shares of Glowpoint Common Stock, and a portion of the Merger Consideration will be reserved for the future exercise of such warrants. Subject to the adjustments described above, upon consummation of the proposed Merger, the stockholders of Glowpoint existing prior to the transaction would collectively own an approximately 34% interest in the combined company and the stockholders of SharedLabs existing prior to the transaction would collectively own an approximately 66% interest in the combined company. These ownership percentages include Glowpoint’s outstanding equity incentive awards that will vest at or following the Effective Time and Glowpoint’s convertible preferred stock on an as-converted basis, but do not include any Glowpoint common shares reserved for future issuance under any equity incentive plan adopted in connection with the Merger or the effect of any adjustments to the Merger consideration.
In this Report, we sometimes refer to Glowpoint during the period subsequent to the completion of the Merger as the “combined organization.”
The completion of the Merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions, including (i) the receipt of all required approvals of the stockholders of Glowpoint and SharedLabs and any required third-party consents and regulatory clearances, including receipt of required approvals from the NYSE American, (ii) the absence of any governmental order or law that makes consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited, (iii) the effectiveness of a Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed by Glowpoint pursuant to which the shares of Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), (iv) the shares of Glowpoint Common Stock to be issued in the Merger being approved for listing on the NYSE American stock exchange, (v) the completion of the SharedLabs Equity Financing and the execution by SharedLabs of the SharedLabs Term Sheet, (vi) the satisfaction and termination prior to closing of all contracts or other agreements to which SharedLabs is a party that provide a counterparty with redeemable or contingent common stock or a guaranteed return, (vii) the redemption of each share of issued and outstanding redeemable SharedLabs common stock, (viii) Glowpoint’s redemption, conversion or amendment of the terms of its Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Series A-2 Preferred Stock”), and Series C Preferred Stock, and (ix) the receipt by each party of a customary opinion that the Merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned upon the other party’s representations and warranties being true and correct (subject to certain materiality exceptions) and the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Merger Agreement. If SharedLabs fails to meet its obligations under either of its debt or equity financing closing conditions, Glowpoint may elect to proceed to close the Merger with a reduction in the shares of its Common Stock to be issued to SharedLabs’ stockholders in the transaction, on terms set forth in the Merger Agreement. Further, Glowpoint and/or SharedLabs could elect to waive certain conditions to the closing of the Merger in order to effect the transaction and, as a result, there can be no assurance that the combined organization will have the benefit of the conditions to closing described above or otherwise set forth in the Merger Agreement. 
As of the date of this Report, we believe that SharedLabs is working to prepare its 2018 year-end financial statements, and working with its independent auditors to complete the audit thereof, for inclusion in the Form S-4. When SharedLabs’ 2018 audited financial statements are available, we and SharedLabs will work to prepare the Form S-4 for filing with the SEC. However, there can be no assurances regarding SharedLabs’ ability to prepare such financial statements and finalize an audit. As a result, there can be no assurance that the parties will be able to file the Form S-4, including SharedLabs’ audited financial statements, on a timely basis. In addition, there can be no assurance that the business combination will be completed on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement or at all. In the event that the business combination is consummated, there can be no assurance that it will ultimately prove to be beneficial to our stockholders. If the Merger transaction is not completed for any reason, our business and operations, as well as the market price of our stock, may be adversely affected. For more information about possible risks of this transaction, see “Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Proposed Merger with SharedLabs.”
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $2,007,000 in cash and no debt. In early 2018, the Company began investing in product development, sales and marketing expenses and capital expenditures in order to develop new service offerings, with the goal of reversing the Company’s negative revenue trends. However, after the Company signed the letter of intent with SharedLabs, the Company ceased such investments in order to focus its efforts on the completion of the Merger. As a result, at this time, the Company does not have an expected timeline for the development and release of new services and/or the generation of additional revenue with new services, and, as a result, the Company will likely continue to experience declines in revenue in the future. In addition, as the Company continues to transform into a service-led organization, existing revenue attributable to its core and legacy 
-4-

product lines and services has declined. The Company has worked to migrate customers from legacy products, such as managed videoconferencing and video meeting suites, to more automated/software-based solutions. As a result of a growing market trend around cloud consumption preferences, more customers are exploring cost-effective software-based services for procuring technology. As this trend continues, the Company is focused on investing in future results by implementing cost savings programs designed to streamline its operations and eliminate overlapping processes and expenses. If the Company fails to make the necessary investments to develop new service offerings that achieve broad market acceptance on a timely basis, it will not be able to compete effectively and will likely experience continued declines in revenue and lower gross margins. Further, if we complete the Merger with SharedLabs, the composition of our board of directors is expected to change in accordance with the Merger Agreement and, as a result, the combined organization may determine to not make such investments and/or pursue business strategies other than those discussed herein. For more information about this and other possible risks of the proposed transaction with SharedLabs, see “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Proposed Merger with SharedLabs.”
Our Services
Video Collaboration Services
We provide a wide range of video collaboration services, from automated to orchestrated, to address the spectrum of user experience and business applications, in an effort to drive adoption of video throughout the enterprise. We deliver our services through a hybrid service platform or as a service layer on top of our customers’ video infrastructure. We provide our customers with the following suite of services to meet their videoconferencing needs:
Managed Videoconferencing is a “high-touch” concierge-based offering where Glowpoint sets up and manages customer videoconferences. We offer managed videoconferencing both as a cloud-based service, with videoconferences hosted in the Glowpoint Cloud, as described under “--Intellectual Property” below, and as an on-premise solution leveraging the customer’s existing video infrastructure. Managed videoconferencing is available globally and works effectively across multiple networks and video devices, including desktop and mobile devices. Despite a trend to move toward “self-service” videoconferencing, many of our customers remain reliant on our scheduling, event support and conference management services. Our managed videoconferencing services are offered to our customers on either a usage basis or on a monthly subscription. These services include: 
Scheduling: Customers can schedule their videoconference using Microsoft Outlook®, Cisco TelePresence Management Suite®, or through Glowpoint’s CustomerPoint® web portal. 
Call Launching: Once the videoconference is scheduled, it automatically launches at the designated time. Glowpoint will “bridge” the videoconference by calling the selected video endpoints at the time of the scheduled call and making sure they are properly connected. We believe that automated launching creates cost efficiencies for both customers and Glowpoint and provides a desired evolution path that aligns with the market trend toward increasing self-service models. 
Conference Monitoring & Support: Glowpoint’s systems will monitor the video meeting to make sure everything remains properly connected and operable during a conference. If an incident occurs during a meeting, one of our conference producers can reconnect and/or fix issues per standard practices or as requested by the customer. 
Conference Reports: Customer administrators can generate reports through our portal to show videoconference details, statistics and success rates. 
JoinMyVideo™ is an on-demand video meeting room (“VMR”) service that allows users to join from web browsers, desktops, mobile apps, and commonly used videoconferencing systems. We believe our JoinMyVideo™ service meets customers’ needs to use video communications in a mobile environment, as further discussed under “--Market Need” below. With JoinMyVideo™, users are able to manage the participants in the video meeting, allowing up to 24 participants to join the meeting. JoinMyVideo™ is a cloud-based software-as-a-service solution, so the customer has no infrastructure to buy and maintain. JoinMyVideo™ is offered to our customers on a monthly subscription basis. 
Hybrid Videoconferencing helps enterprises migrate from managed videoconferencing to VMRs by bringing together attributes of both services. Users can schedule their VMR, add endpoints, and send invitations to participants through an online portal. At the scheduled time, the VMR is launched, connecting the scheduled endpoints and allowing self-service users to join from video systems and desktop and mobile video apps. We believe our Hybrid Videoconferencing service merges these connection capabilities and therefore accommodates all types of users and meetings.

Video Meeting Suites provide remote access to videoconferencing for everyday business meetings and events, allowing our customers to conduct meetings and events in over 4,000 physical meeting suites across 1,300 cities without investing in video devices or infrastructure. We have partnered with the owners of these videoconference centers and arrange for our customers to hold videoconferences at convenient locations across the world based on customers’ needs. Our primary service includes the scheduling and management of a highly orchestrated business-class meeting for a professional meeting experience. As part of the extended offering beyond the physical office suite, we also enable participants who elect to use a mobile device to join a video conference from anywhere in the world. These services are largely usage-based. We also offer our customers monthly subscription rates based on a fixed number of concurrent users. 
Webcasting events enable our customers to stream live video feeds to up to thousands of viewers through their browsers and mobile devices. Enterprises often use this service on a quarterly basis for earnings calls and town hall events. 
Remote Service Management
Our Remote Service Management provides an overlay to enterprise information technology (“IT”) and channel partner support organizations and provides 24/7 support and management of customer video environments. Our services are designed to align with a globally recognized set of best practices, Information Technology Infrastructure Library (“ITIL”), to standardize processes and communicate through a consistent set of terms with our customers and partners. We leverage a best-in-class IT service management (“ITSM”) provider, ServiceNow Inc., to systematically provide Remote Service Management, as well as enable Glowpoint to integrate with an enterprise’s systems and workflows. 
We offer, on a monthly subscription basis, three tiers of Remote Service Management options, ranging from automated monitoring to end-to-end management to complement the needs of IT support organizations, as described below: 
Resolve - Total Support is our most comprehensive management and support service and targets enterprises that want to completely offload day-to-day operations of their video environment to Glowpoint. We provide:
24x7 Support Desk: Around-the-clock access to our expert staff via phone and email for support inquiries. 
Incident Management: Systematic management of incidents from service request to closure. All incidents are tracked and visible from our online ITSM portal. 
Problem Management: Root cause analysis and coordination to prevent and quickly repair incidents. 
Change Management: Management of maintenance contracts for infrastructure and endpoints to ensure systems are up to date, operating at peak performance, and have coverage from the manufacturer. 
Site Certifications: Baseline testing of endpoints to make sure they are configured for optimal performance. 
Service Level Agreements (“SLA”): Performance guarantees with our SLA backed services. 
Helpdesk provides level 1 support and allows enterprise IT to scale and expand the reach of support to end users. We complement the existing staff by taking the initial service request from the end users and providing incident management. We provide: 
24x7 Support Desk: Around-the-clock access to our expert staff via phone and email for support inquiries. 
Incident Management: Systematic management of minor incidents, general service inquiries, and an initial assessment for major and critical incidents. We escalate major incidents to the appropriate and responsible parties. 
Proactive Monitoring is a remote and automated monitoring service that detects events and alerts customers’ IT when a service impacting event is discovered. The service is provided in conjunction with either Resolve - Total Support or Helpdesk. We provide: 
Event Management: 24/7 monitoring of our customers’ infrastructure and endpoints with email alerts when events are detected. 
Automated Video Room Sweeps (“AVRS”): Our custom developed service accesses our customers’ endpoints every night, measures audio & video quality, and verifies firmware. 
Network Services

Glowpoint’s network services provide our customers around the world with network solutions that ensure reliable, high-quality and secure traffic of video, data and internet. Network services are offered to our customers on a monthly subscription basis. Our network services business carries variable costs associated with the purchasing and reselling of this connectivity. We offer our customers the following networking solutions that can be tailored to each customer’s needs: 

• | Cloud Connect: Video™: Allows our customers to outsource the management of their video traffic to us and provides the customer’s office locations with a secure, dedicated video network connection to the Glowpoint Cloud for video communications.


• | Cloud Connect: Converge™: Provides customized Multiprotocol Label Switching (“MPLS”) solutions for customers who require a converged network. A converged network is an efficient network solution that combines the customer’s voice, video, data, and Internet traffic over one or more common access circuits. Glowpoint fully manages and prioritizes traffic to ensure that video and other business critical applications run smoothly. 


• | Cloud Connect: Cross Connect™: Allows the customer to leverage their existing carrier for the extension of a Layer 2 private line to Glowpoint’s data center.

Professional and Other Services
Our professional services include onsite support, or dispatch, as well as configuration or customization of equipment or software on behalf of a customer. On a limited basis, we also resell video equipment to our customers. 
Sales and Marketing
We currently sell our services through direct sales and indirect sales channels. During the past several years, we had limited resources to invest in sales and marketing. As of December 31, 2018, we had two employees engaged in sales and marketing. We reduced our sales and marketing expenses from $2,047,000 in 2015 to $664,000 in 2016, $413,000 in 2017 and $319,000 in 2018, in order to improve EBITDA and cash flow from operations. Our sales/account management team is responsible for developing relationships and expanding opportunities within our existing customer base as well as targeting our services to other large and medium-sized companies.  We partner with agents and wholesale channels to expand the size and reach of these efforts.  The customers we target have a proven need for business communication services in diverse vertical markets, such as professional services, business services, computer software, manufacturing and financial services. The efforts of our channel sales group focuses on partnering with complementary system integrators and service providers, to leverage their customer bases and distribution channels. We private label or co-brand our services for these partners depending on their requirements. We primarily focus our marketing efforts on direct marketing programs aimed at our target buyer personas (e.g., IT decision makers) within our target verticals. We seek to generate qualified leads for our sales team, educate and retain existing customers, generate brand awareness through public relations including social media and drive service enhancements using research and customer feedback. We believe that sales cycles associated with selling our services directly to enterprise IT organizations and through our channel partners typically range from six to eighteen months.
Market Need
As enterprise and mid-market businesses, such as many of our customers, increasingly seek to improve customer experience through the quality of communication services, they are confronted with several industry trends presenting emerging and varied challenges. We believe the most forceful among these trends are:

• | increasing mobility of the workforce;


• | shifting priorities of business decision makers, including an increased preference for cloud delivery of applications, software-defined networking, and management of multiple and varied devices; and


• | the rise of multi-channel customer service involving multiple modes of communications.

As we continue to transform Glowpoint into a service-led organization, revenue attributable to our core and legacy product lines and services has declined. We have worked to migrate customers from legacy products, such as managed videoconferencing and video meeting suites, to more automated/software-based solutions. As a result of a growing market trend around cloud consumption preferences, more customers are exploring cost-effective software-based services for procuring technology. As this trend continues, the Company has remained focused on investing in future results by implementing cost savings programs designed 
-7-

to streamline its operations and eliminate overlapping processes and expenses. These cost savings programs have included: (i) reducing headcount, (ii) closing office space, (iii) eliminating other real estate costs and infrastructure associated with unused or under-utilized facilities, (iv) relocating certain job functions to lower cost geographies, including service delivery, customer care, research and development, human resources and finance, and (v) implementing reductions in cost of revenue associated with external service providers. 
Many enterprises have become dependent on video communications for increased productivity and reduced operating costs, thus making video communications part of their core business practices. With the technology advancements over the past few years, including browser-based and mobile video, the options for video collaboration solutions and services are greater than ever before. The growing combinations of hardware, software, and networks challenge enterprise IT organizations with finding the right fit for their business objectives. Enterprises must consider and account for implementation and integration, user adoption, analytics, management and support, and maintaining a return on investment with the existing technology deployment while preventing technology obsolescence. As a result, businesses are increasingly seeking an outsourced partner for managed services and hosted, cloud-based infrastructure to mitigate risk, reduce operational costs, and increase user satisfaction by delivering a higher caliber support level to their business.
We believe that many companies cannot fully support quality video communications on their existing infrastructure and networks. Enterprises have reduced or curtailed investments in immersive telepresence (“ITP”) videoconferencing systems, now preferring cloud-based solutions and personal or smaller group video systems. Enabling video on desktops and increased mobility remains a primary enterprise objective. As demand for ITP systems and related services decreases, and the demand for mobility and personal video services increases, we will seek to evolve our solutions to align with and attempt to satisfy this market demand. 
Glowpoint provides enterprises with the ability to simplify the video experience, which increases adoption and user participation. Glowpoint’s unique and wide range of video collaboration services is intended to provide a service for every user and meeting type within the enterprise. We believe our ITSM platform delivers the right tools, automation, and analytics to partners to enable a successful video deployment. 
Competition
With respect to our video collaboration services, we primarily compete with managed services companies, videoconferencing equipment resellers and telecommunication providers, including BT Conferencing, AT&T, Verizon, LogMeIn, Yorktel, ConvergeOne, Whitlock and AVI-SPL. We also compete with certain start-up and venture capital-backed companies that offer hosted videoconference bridging solutions, including Blue Jeans Networks, Vidyo and Zoom. Lastly, the technology and software providers, including Cisco, LifeSize, Microsoft (Skype for Business and Teams) and Polycom, are delivering competitive cloud-based videoconferencing and calling services. With respect to our network services, we primarily compete with telecommunications carriers, including British Telecom, AT&T, Verizon and Telus. Our competitors offer services similar to ours both on a bundled and un-bundled basis, creating a highly competitive environment with pressure on pricing of such services. Competitor solutions also create opportunities for integration and support services for Glowpoint.

We believe we differentiate ourselves based on our full suite of cloud and managed video collaboration services in combination with the ITSM platform for support automation. We believe our services are unique based on our intellectual property, user interfaces and capabilities that we have built over the years. 
Customers
Our customers include Fortune 1000 companies, along with small and medium enterprises across a wide range of industries including consulting, executive search, broadcast media, legal, finance, insurance and technology. Major customers are defined as direct customers or channel partners that account for more than 10% of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2018, two major customers accounted for 25% and 21%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the same two major customers accounted for 23% and 16%, respectively, of our total revenue. Any reduction in the use of our services or the business failure by one of our major customers and/or wholesale channel partners could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Intellectual Property
Glowpoint has invested in research and development, engineering and application development in the process of building our managed service and cloud platforms. Some of this development has led to issued patents, as described below, along with ongoing recognition in the industry as having unique tools and applications to enable our video applications.

Glowpoint Cloud Conferencing 
The Glowpoint Cloud is based on a Service Oriented Architecture framework that enables us to create unique unified communication service offerings. Glowpoint’s cloud-based-video services can be delivered as a software and infrastructure service in a hosted environment or can support a hybrid mix of public and private clouds.
Videoconferencing has traditionally presented challenges for the user by presenting a complex maze of systems and networks that must be navigated and closely managed. Although most of the business-quality video systems today are “standards-based,” there are inherent interoperability problems between different vendors’ video equipment, resulting in communication islands. Glowpoint’s suite of cloud and managed video services can be accessed and utilized by customers regardless of their technology or network. Customers who purchase a Cisco, Polycom, Avaya, or LifeSize (Logitech) system, or use certain other third-party video communications software such as Microsoft (Skype for Business), WebEx or WebRTC, may all take advantage of the Glowpoint Cloud regardless of their choice of network. We have built the Glowpoint Cloud to support all standard video signaling protocols, including SIP, H.323 and Integrated Services Digital Network (“ISDN”) using infrastructure from a variety of manufacturers.
The Glowpoint Cloud combines years of best practices, experience and technology development into a video collaboration platform that provides instant connectivity, self-serve and managed help desk resources, and the ease of use that makes video collaboration seamless and effortless. Beyond the technology and applications, the Glowpoint Cloud is built around security protocols to enable enterprises and organizations of any size to communicate with other desired video users in a secure, high-quality and reliable fashion.
Video Service Platform
Our Video Service Platform provides enterprise customers with a cloud-based system for managing video collaboration.  The Video Service Platform, which leverages technology from an industry leading ITSM provider, ServiceNow Inc., is available to Glowpoint’s channel partners and enterprise customers. The Video Service Platform’s scalability and multi-tenant design allows Glowpoint and its channel partners to seamlessly activate existing and new enterprise customers of Glowpoint.  It is completely web-based and accessible from any web-enabled device. The Video Service Platform automates and streamlines critical functions and workflows needed by IT organizations for managing enterprise video collaboration environments, including incident management, change management, and reporting/analytics for continuous improvement.  Other benefits provided to enterprise IT organizations include:

• | Better transparency into the performance of the enterprise collaboration environment via business intelligence metrics, reporting and management dashboards;


• | Greater scale with self-service support, giving end users an easy interface for submitting/tracking tickets;


• | Deeper expertise for managing video collaboration with access to Glowpoint’s Remote Service Management services and knowledge base;


• | More efficiencies gained by automating manual tasks and workflows including escalations, updates/notifications, and provisioning; and


• | Access to ITIL.

Patents
The development of our “video as a service” applications and network architecture has resulted in a significant amount of proprietary information and technology, including real-time metering and billing for video calls and intelligent call routing. We believe that our patented proprietary technology provides an important barrier for competitors’ potential offerings of similar video communications services. We have been awarded six patents:

• | U.S. Patent No. 7,200,213 was awarded in April 2007 for our live video operator assistance feature. Our “Live Operator” technology provides customers with the ability to obtain live, face-to-face assistance and has widespread application, from general video call assistance to “video concierge” services. This patent is an essential component of providing “expert on demand” and telepresence “white glove” business class support services. This patent expires November 17, 2024. 


• | U.S. Patent No. 7,664,098 was awarded in February 2010 for our real-time metering and billing for Internet Protocol (“IP”) based calls. Our “Call Detail Records” patent for IP-based calls provides the ability to meter and bill an end-user on a transactional basis, just as traditional telephone calls are billed. This unique capability is a vital development as more and more telepresence and videoconferencing calling traffic is distributed over disparate

IP-based networks – rather than ISDN – as business-to-business calling has become more common for video users. This patent expires August 4, 2026. 

• | U.S. Patent No. 7,916,717 was awarded in March 2011 for our Systems and Method for Automated Routing of Incoming and Outgoing Video Calls between IP and ISDN networks. This technology ensures the simple and seamless migration from ISDN to IP for the purpose of connecting IP users with ISDN systems around the world. This automated call routing capability has been leveraged to provide a least cost routing and gateway method to customers. This patent expires September 16, 2028. 


• | U.S. Patent No. 8,259,152 was awarded in September 2012 for our Video Call Distributor, which includes systems and methods for distributing high quality real time video calls over an IP Packet-Based Wide Area Network, leveraging existing routing rules and logic of a call management system. This patent expires July 3, 2031. 


• | U.S. Patent No. 8,576,270 was awarded in November 2013 for our Intelligent Call Management and Redirection systems and methods. These systems and methods can be used to detect the status of a specified video endpoint. Pre-defined rules can be configured so that a call that is not completed for any reason can be transferred to another destination such as a video mail service or an automated or live operator service. This patent expires January 14, 2030. 


• | U.S. Patent No. 8,933,983 was awarded in January 2015 for our Intelligent Call Management and Redirection systems and methods. This new patent relates to a method for routing packet-based network video calls using an Intelligent Call Policy Management (“ICPM”) system that can detect the status of a specified video endpoint and refuse to connect a video call based on the video endpoint’s status. This patent expires October 11, 2025.

We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. The Exchange Act requires us to file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Copies of these periodic reports, proxy statements and other information can be read and copied on official business days during the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information that we file electronically with the SEC. 
In addition, we make available, free of charge, on our Internet website, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file this material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.
