ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are an innovative biotechnology company developing transformative allogeneic cell therapies to create products for the treatment of both solid tumor and hematological malignancies with significant unmet medical need. We have created a comprehensive allogeneic cell therapy platform that includes industry-leading induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, differentiation know-how to generate immune effector cells from iPSCs, or iPSC- derived cells, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, or CRISPR, mediated precision gene editing that allows us to incorporate multiple transgenes and remove target genes intended to optimize cell product performance, sophisticated protein engineering capabilities to develop proprietary next generation chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs, our proprietary Allo-EvasionTM technology intended to prevent rejection of our cell products by the host immune system, and cutting edge manufacturing capabilities intended to minimize product development and supply risk. We believe that these vertically integrated capabilities will allow us to further expand our existing pipeline and develop therapeutics from iPSC-derived natural killer cells, or iNK cells, or iNK, and iPSC-derived T cells, or iT cells, or iT, that may provide enhanced clinical outcomes compared to available therapeutic options. Our vision is to become a premier fully integrated biotechnology company by developing and ultimately commercializing off-the-shelf allogeneic cell therapies that dramatically and positively transform the lives of patients suffering from life-threatening cancers. To achieve our vision, we have assembled a world-class team whose members collectively have decades of experience in cell therapy and drug development, manufacturing, and commercialization.
The field of cell therapy is rapidly evolving, with autologous and allogeneic technologies demonstrating the strong potential of this therapeutic modality. We believe that our industry leading, end-to-end iPSC-derived allogeneic cell therapy platform will allow us to overcome technical and biological limitations of other donor- derived cell therapies. The unlimited replication capacity of iPSCs allows us to incorporate multiple genetic modifications at precise sites, or loci, in the genome of iPSCs that are designed to improve cell function using a CRISPR-mediated approach targeting a DNA repair pathway called homology directed repair, or HDR. The precision of our CRISPR-HDR gene editing technology and clonal selection eliminates random integration events and allows more controlled expression of transgenes of interest compared to other gene editing methodologies. The self- renewal capacity of iPSCs also enables the generation of master cell banks derived from single genetically engineered clones thus allowing the implementation of cost-efficient manufacturing of drug product that can be made available on demand at any clinical site. We have assembled a unique and powerful combination of technologies that bring together a preeminent iPSC-derived allogeneic cell therapy platform with highly advanced cell engineering and manufacturing capabilities. We believe this unique combination puts us in a position to change the oncology treatment paradigm and market.
The key elements of our approach include:
Our efficient precision gene editing technology:
We have developed highly efficient gene engineering processes to generate our product candidates. Our first product candidate, CNTY-101, has six CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination and repair edits, and we plan to incorporate additional edits in our future product candidates. We are currently using the CRISPR-MAD7 nuclease to enable precise editing of the iPSC genome, and have developed proprietary applications of the CRISPR-MAD7 technology to genetically modify iPSCs by simultaneously removing target genes or adding transgenes (which is commonly known as knocking-out and knocking-in, respectively) of interest at precise genetic loci. Our approach is designed to preserve genome integrity and achieves more predictable and consistent transgene expression as compared to approaches driven by viruses or transposable segments called transposons, which result in varied gene copy number and random integration events that risk mutations, namely insertional mutagenesis.

Our proprietary Allo-EvasionTM technology:
We are leveraging our Allo-EvasionTM technology to design cells capable of evading identification and destruction by the host (patient) immune system. We believe this technology may permit dosing in patients with limited or no immune preconditioning regimens. The reduction in allogeneic immune-reactivity enabled by our use of this technology, which is designed to prevent rejection by the patient’s immune system may allow repeat dosing of our CAR-modified cell therapies, and sustain therapeutic efficacy over a long period of time.
CAR and protein engineering:
CAR design is a critical component of innovative cell therapy product candidates. We assembled a team of scientists with deep protein engineering expertise and invested in the use of the variable domain of the heavy chain antibody, or VHH binders. We believe that this antibody platform investment to develop world-class CAR engineering capabilities will allow us to create multi-specific CAR constructs targeting more than one tumor antigen. We believe that targeting multiple antigens on tumor cells will help address tumor heterogeneity and antigen loss, which are frequently observed in tumor cells. We have created a proprietary synthetic library of humanized VHH binders to enable in-house binder screens and multiple campaigns against several tumor antigens are ongoing to generate the CAR constructs for future product candidates.
Common engineered iPSC progenitor accelerates new product candidate generation:
With other cell therapy platforms generated from cells with limited replicative capacity, the creation of a new product candidate requires starting over with each of the gene engineering steps having to be incorporated into the product. This is not only time and resource intensive; it also makes it more difficult to predict functionality and safety profile based upon products that may have been clinically tested in earlier programs. In contrast, all of our iPSC- derived product candidates include a set of shared core features intended to increase their functionality, safety, and persistence. We integrate these core features into common engineered iPSC progenitors, which have several advantages:
Significant acceleration of new product candidate generation.
Multiple product candidates are generated by engineering additional features, such as adding different CARs to the common progenitor to create new product candidates for different tumor indications. With this approach, we do not need to re-engineer common functionalities every time we generate a new product candidate.
Robust manufacturing processes for multiple product candidates.
Since the starting iPSC line is the same for multiple product candidates, our manufacturing processes are predictable and robust.
Predictability of product candidate functionality, safety profile, and persistence.
Because multiple clinical candidates are derived from the same engineered iPSC line, the lessons learned from one product candidate can be leveraged across multiple product candidates, which facilitates further product development. For instance, we believe the allo-reactivity of products derived from the same common engineered iPSC progenitor should be very similar.
We received a study may proceed notification from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for our lead product candidate CNTY-101, a CAR-iNK product candidate targeting CD19 for lymphoma, in August 2022. We initiated the Phase 1 ELiPSE-1 trial in CD19+ B-cell lymphomas and began dosing patients in February 2023. Our second product candidate, CNTY-102, is a bi-specific CD19 + CD22 CAR - iT product

candidate targeting lymphoma. Our newest product candidate, CNTY-107, is a Nectin-4 CAR - iT targeted product candidate for Nectin-4 positive solid tumors.
In January 2023, we announced a strategic internal portfolio prioritization through which, among other discovery efforts, CNTY-103, a CAR-iNK product targeting CD133 and a discovery program for hematological malignancies, were de-prioritized, allowing us to further prioritize our CNTY-102 and CNTY-107 product candidates, which we believe have a higher probability of technical success and greater market potential. As a result of the operational restructuring, lab operations in Seattle and Hamilton have been closed and research activities have been consolidated in Philadelphia.
In January 2022, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or Bristol-Myers Squibb, to develop and commercialize up to four iNK or iT programs for hematological malignancies and solid tumors. The collaboration includes our fourth candidate, CNTY-104, a multi-specific collaboration program targeting acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and CNTY-106, a multi-specific collaboration program for multiple myeloma. As there are disease settings which will favor iNK or iT products, we are actively investigating both iNK and iT cell platforms for CNTY-104 and CNTY-106, as either may have preferential clinical features. 
We are also advancing an earlier discovery stage pipeline with novel CARs and binders against multiple solid and hematological tumor targets using our iNK and iT cell therapy platforms. We believe that the therapeutics we discover and develop, if approved, will have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients suffering from devastating malignancies. Our approach to developing therapies for life-threatening cancers of highly unmet medical need potentially presents an opportunity to efficiently advance our product candidates through clinical development, regulatory approval and ultimately to commercialization.
Our collaboration with FUJIFILM Cellular Dynamics Inc., or FCDI, provides us with licenses to certain premier iPSC technologies, patents and know-how, which gave us our initial start and enabled us to accelerate generation of our first-generation product candidates and development of our manufacturing processes. We have built and expanded on this foundation with our own resources, applying our own gene editing, protein engineering, process development, and manufacturing expertise to develop our novel product candidates and platforms for which we are developing our own intellectual property. We retain exclusive commercialization rights in the United States and other major commercial markets for our product candidates developed pursuant to our collaboration with FCDI.
Our pipeline
We are assembling a portfolio of allogeneic iNK and iT cell therapy product candidates across solid tumor and hematological malignancies. This pipeline is comprised of cell therapies that will address diseases where we believe current therapies are inadequate. All product candidates incorporate our proprietary Allo-EvasionTM technology to avoid host rejection and potentially increase the durability of clinical responses. We received a safe to proceed notification from the FDA for our first product candidate, CNTY-101 for the treatment of CD19+ B-cell malignancies in August 2022. In February 2023, we announced that we started dosing patients in the first-in-human Phase 1 ELiPSE-1 trial evaluating CNTY-101 in relapsed or refractory CD19 positive B-cell lymphomas.
Our second product candidate, CNTY-102, is designed to further improve B-cell malignancy treatment by simultaneously targeting CD19 and a second antigen. Our newest product candidate, CNTY-107 is a Nectin-4 targeted product for Nectin-4+ tumors. In collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb, we are developing CNTY-104 to treat AML. We are also developing CNTY-106 in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb for multiple myeloma.
Our development programs consist of the product candidates illustrated in the pipeline chart below:

----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CNTY-101: Our CAR-iNK product candidate targeting CD19 for relapsed, refractory B-cell lymphoma.
Our lead product candidate, CNTY-101, is an allogeneic, iPSC-derived CAR-iNK cell therapy that has been engineered to express CD19 CAR, soluble IL-15, an EGFR safety switch, and also contains gene edits needed to incorporate Allo-EvasionTM technology. We are currently dosing patients in the Phase 1 trial for CNTY-101, ELiPSE-1.

CNTY-104: Our CAR-iNK or CAR-iT multi-specific collaboration program for acute myeloid leukemia.
CNTY-104 will utilize our multi-specific iNK or iT cells for the treatment of AML, which we intend to develop in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. We will evaluate both the iNK and iT cell therapy platforms and choose the one likely to provide the best therapeutic index in the clinic. 
CNTY-106: Our CAR-iNK or CAR-iT multispecific collaboration program for multiple myeloma.
CNTY-106 will utilize our multi-specific iNK or IT cells for the treatment of multiple myeloma, which we intend to develop in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. We will evaluate both the iNK and IT cell therapy platforms and select the one that we believe will be most likely to provide the best therapeutic index in the clinic. 
Discovery platform.
In addition to our named programs, we are actively engaged in a number of earlier stage discovery programs where we believe our iPSC-derived allogeneic cell therapy platform may provide differentiated therapeutic benefits. These discovery stage initiatives are focused on several solid tumor indications including renal cell carcinoma and other indications. For these and other indications, we plan to use multispecific CARs and explore the use of both iNK and iT cells to identify the best cell platform to build the product candidate. We continue to advance our gamma delta and alpha beta iT cell platforms for our future T cell based candidates.
Our use of iPSCs provides us with a differentiated advantage in product development and manufacturing
The majority of allogeneic approaches currently in development use differentiated T cells or NK cells derived from the peripheral blood of healthy donors. Although the use of allogeneic cells in the manufacture of CAR- based T cell or NK cell therapies offers significant advantages, the use of donor cells in the production of allogeneic cell therapies has significant limitations. For example, the number of doses that can be produced from a single donation of blood is limited, such that multiple donations will be needed over the lifetime of a product. Therefore, genetic modifications must be performed in their entirety following each donation. Furthermore, all blood, even from the same donor collected at different times, has some degree of variability and, as a result, product comparability from donation to donation must be demonstrated. In addition, the number of edits that can be introduced into the genome of T cells or NK cells is severely limited, as each engineering step requires cells to replicate. Excessive expansion cycles often result in cell exhaustion, with the engineered lymphocytes (white blood cells) expressing checkpoint molecules, often accompanied by a loss of functionality. As a consequence, the engineering process for these donor-derived cell therapies requires a careful balancing between the number of replication cycles achievable and the generation of fully functional cells resulting in significant limitations.
We believe our engineered, iPSC-derived allogeneic cell therapy platforms can overcome many of the challenges inherent to cell therapy, provide a significant advantage over existing cell therapy technologies. We are focused on developing novel therapeutics designed to address many of the significant unmet medical needs in cancer treatment.

Core characteristics of our iPSC-derived allogeneic cell therapy platforms
​
​
Our iPSC-derived allogeneic cells differentiate our therapeutic development approach
The source cells used in the manufacture of our allogeneic cell therapy candidates are iPSCs. An iPSC is a type of stem cell that can be generated directly from a somatic cell. A somatic cell is a cell that has become functionally differentiated, or specialized, such as a blood cell, skin cell or bone cell. IPSC- derived cell products offer significant technical and manufacturing advantages. These cells have unlimited replication capacity and can act as a progenitor cell for other cell types, including the different types of immune cells. IPSCs share similar biological properties with embryonic stem cells, such as morphology, patterns of gene and protein expression, and growth properties including mitotic activity and doubling time. Our in-licensed iPSC technology allows us to reprogram differentiated cells into iPSCs and to somatic the iPSCs to generate different immune cell types including iNK cells and iT cells.
We believe the use of iPSCs will enable us to manufacture cell therapies of increased consistency, in a shorter period of time, at scale and at reduced cost compared to donor-derived NK or T cell therapies. Unlike these donor- derived cell therapies where all the engineering steps are performed using differentiated cells, all of our engineering procedures are performed on iPSCs. We believe that using iPSCs as a starting point for our cell therapies will allow us to produce our allogeneic cell therapies in an efficient and consistent manner. iPSCs are more amenable to multiple genetic manipulations than differentiated lymphocytes and are capable of maintaining their viability through numerous expansion rounds. We select specific single cell clones from bulk engineered cell product, which we characterize to include specified edits and ensure the absence of off-target genomic alterations. A single cell clone is used to construct a master cell bank capable of providing a sufficient number of doses for the life of a product due to the unlimited replicative capacity of iPSCs.
Our use of iPSCs provide us with differentiated advantages in product development and manufacturing

Our strategy
Our vision is to be a leader in the treatment of both solid tumor and hematological malignancies that address unmet medical needs by developing innovative allogeneic cell therapy products derived from our proprietary technologies. We are initially focused on advancing the research, clinical development and commercialization of tumor-targeted iNK and iT cell therapeutics. We believe that our iPSC-derived allogeneic cell therapy platforms have the potential to overcome the limitations of existing therapies, lower manufacturing costs and improve patient outcomes. To deliver on our mission, we intend to:

• | Build a leading cell therapy company leveraging our comprehensive iPSC-derived allogeneic cell therapy platforms designed to overcome the limitations of existing cancer therapies. We have created comprehensive allogeneic cell therapy platforms that include industry-leading iPSC differentiation know- how, CRISPR-mediated precision gene editing, sophisticated protein engineering capabilities, proprietary Allo-EvasionTM technology, and cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities. We believe the incorporation of these elements into our platforms affords us numerous advantages over autologous and donor-derived differentiated T, NK and other cell therapies, and may eliminate many of the challenges inherent in these other cell therapy modalities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize the potential to treat a broad range of cancers by exploiting the distinct biologies of both NK and T cells. We are initially developing our CAR-iNK and CAR-iT cell therapy platforms for multiple indications including lymphoma, Nectin-4 positive tumors, acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma and other solid tumor and hematological malignancies. We anticipate each platform will have a distinct biology that influences its function, and accordingly, the disease settings in which it is best suited for development. We view this dual development strategy as an opportunity to maximize the potential benefits of each platform and its associated immune cell. In the future, we may develop regimens that simultaneously incorporate both CAR-iNK and CAR-iT cells in the treatment of individual patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our Allo-EvasionTM technology across our product platform to avoid host rejection and enable repeat dosing. Central to the potential clinical performance of our iPSC-derived cell therapies is our novel and proprietary Allo-EvasionTM technology, which we intend to implement across our entire product platform. This proprietary technology allows us to engineer cells designed to avoid recognition and rejection by the host immune system. Furthermore, it enables repeat dosing, which we believe will enable us to immediately reinforce the immunological line of defense as cells dosed previously succumb to immune exhaustion and provide our cell therapies the benefit of enhanced durability and persistence. We believe this may reduce or possibly eliminate the need for immune preconditioning regimens, and enhance the recruitment of host immune cells to participate in the anti-tumor response. We believe these advantages could enable the implementation of more flexible and effective dosing protocols for our off-the-shelf product candidates, which we anticipate will increase physician and patient access.

• | Exploit serial gene editing of iPSCs to create product candidates with enhanced functionalities and fit for purpose product characteristics. We utilize CRISPR-mediated precision gene editing that allows us to incorporate multiple transgenes and knock-outs to achieve precise genetic modifications at defined locations in the iPSC genome. Our lead clinical product candidate, CNTY-101, incorporates six gene edits, which we believe are essential attributes necessary for meaningful clinical performance, including a CAR to mediate tumor recognition and killing, features to evade immune rejection and a safety switch to enable product elimination if ever necessary. We believe this initial set of gene edits will form the foundation for follow-on product candidate development. Additionally, we believe our investment in our gene editing technology will allow us to expand upon our current capabilities and integrate further fit for purpose gene edits intended to enhance clinical performance of our future product candidates.

• | Leverage our own manufacturing infrastructure, product and process understanding, and scale-up technologies to minimize manufacturing risk. We are strategically investing in manufacturing across all aspects of the value chain to become leaders in the industry. We have built internal manufacturing facilities, including our Branchburg, New Jersey Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, plant, that we believe will enable us to learn and iterate more rapidly and increase control of development timelines for expedited development of high-quality product candidates. We are in the process of tech transferring the first product into our cGMP facility for the purpose of producing and releasing it, as well as future products, from this facility for clinical trials. We will continue to invest in process and analytical development capabilities and closely study our cell process parameters that affect product quality. Furthermore, we intend to establish expertise in scale-up technologies designed to enable optimal manufacturing scale, which we believe will reduce cost of goods and improve patient access.

Background
The role of NK cells and T cells in the human immune system
The human immune system is comprised of two integrated systems, the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. The innate immune system involves an immediate, non-specific response to recognize and protect against foreign pathogens based on broadly conserved pathogen associated molecular patterns and generally lacks pathogen or disease-specific immune memory.
Innate immune system—NK Cells
Cytotoxic NK cells are part of the front-line innate immune response, and in this capacity, monitor the body for signs of pathogens or signals of disease. NK cells have the unique ability to selectively identify and destroy abnormal cells through multiple direct and indirect mechanisms while leaving normal healthy cells unharmed. These mechanisms include (i) direct innate killing by binding to stress ligands expressed by diseased or dysfunctional cells and releasing toxic granules and perforins, (ii) indirect killing by producing and releasing proinflammatory cytokines that play a pivotal role in orchestrating the adaptive immune response, and (iii) antibody-mediated targeted killing by binding to cells targeted for elimination through a process known as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.
Adaptive immune system—T Cells
The adaptive immune system is characterized by antigen-specific immune responses mediated by T and B cells. T cells are distinguished from other immune system cells by the presence of a T cell receptor, or TCR, on their surface. TCRs are activated through engagement with antigens on the major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, of cells. In humans, these antigens are known as human leukocyte antigens, or HLAs. Upon antigen recognition, CD8 T cells, also referred to as cytotoxic lymphocytes, or CTLs, bind to the MHC-antigen complex, become activated and destroy the targeted cell. The adaptive immune responses require several days to develop because T and B cells need to undergo clonal expansion before they can mount an immune response. The innate and adaptive immune systems also differ on the longevity of the immune response. After elimination of the pathogen, T and B cells can persist for decades as memory cells and quickly respond to new challenges by the same pathogen. We seek to take advantage of the unique properties of T cells and their proven anti-cancer activity to engineer iPSC-derived T cell products.
Cellular immunotherapy and its use in the treatment of cancer
Cellular immunotherapy is a type of immunotherapy that focuses on modulating or enhancing the activity of different lymphocytes, in particular CTLs and NK cells, to treat cancer. The cells are typically engineered with receptors that redirect them to recognize and destroy tumor cells. A frequently used approach for cellular immunotherapy involves CARs on the surface of a lymphocyte that enable the CTL or NK cell to recognize specific antigens that are present on the surface of tumor cells.

13



At one end of the CAR is single or multiple binding domains that engage one or more target antigens. These binding domains are exposed to the outside of the engineered lymphocyte, where they can recognize the target antigen or antigens. To enable the engineering of multi-specific CARs, we use camelid VHH antibodies.
Our use of camelid VHH antibodies enables our design of multi-specific binding domains
​
​
As illustrated above, our CAR constructs incorporate VHHs. VHH domains are derived from a camelid antibody, a type of antibody found in camels, llamas and sharks, that consists of a heavy chain only with one variable region. This structure gives us greater design flexibility, including the use of concatemers that target multiple epitopes on the same antigen (biparatopic CARs) or multiple tumor antigens (bi- or tri-specific CARs).
Advancements in cell therapy approaches have enhanced treatment alternatives for patients
Cell therapy has built on the success of already approved autologous CAR-T cell therapies. Allogeneic therapy, which uses lymphocytes donated by a healthy donor as the starting material, is designed to overcome several limitations inherent in the autologous approach. We believe the use of iPSC-derived cells further expands the therapeutic potential of cell therapy beyond those that utilize healthy donor-derived NK or T cells.

14



Evolution of targeted cell therapies in cancer
​
​
Advantages of iPSC vs. donor-derived approaches
An iPSC is a type of stem cell that can be generated directly from a functionally differentiated somatic cell such as a blood cell, skin cell or bone cell. IPSC-derived cell products offer what we believe are significant technical and manufacturing advantages compared to both autologous and other allogeneic approaches. IPSC cells can propagate indefinitely and can act as a progenitor cell for other cell types, including the different types of immune cells. Our iPSC technology allows us to reprogram differentiated cells to become iPSCs and to then differentiate the iPSCs to generate different immune cell types including NK cells and T cells. We believe some of the advantages offered by iPSCs are:
Receptive to complex genetic editing.
We believe that iPSCs are far more amenable to multiple genetic manipulations than donor-derived NK cells and T cells because iPSC cells can undergo multiple rounds of replication without loss of functionality. In contrast, differentiated cells used in donor derived allogeneic approaches are limited to just a few genetic edits, which can impact their overall functionality. The number of edits that can be introduced into the genome of differentiated NK cells or T cells is limited because each engineering step requires cells to replicate and too many expansion cycles often result in cell exhaustion and loss of functionality.
Significant replication capacity.
iPSCs are derived from single cell clones, which are used to construct a master cell bank capable of providing a sufficient number of doses for the life of a product due to the unlimited replicative capacity of iPSCs.
Streamlined manufacturing and consistent product.
The use of a single master cell bank allows iPSC-derived products to be produced with greater consistency, at the greatest possible scale and at reduced cost compared to donor-derived NK cells or T cells.
We believe that iPSC-derived cell therapies provide meaningful advantages over other modalities and have the potential to change the oncology treatment paradigm.

Stages of iPSC gene editing, characterization, and clonal selection
​
​
Stages of iPSC gene editing, characterization, and clonal selection prior to the generation of the engineered iPSC master cell bank (MCB). Genetic engineering of our product candidates occurs exclusively at the iPSC stage, where the cells have unlimited replicative capacity and pluripotency. In the above figure, we highlight the multiple steps required for selection of the final CNTY-101 product candidate. Gene edited iPSCs from multiple donors were enriched for having the introduced transgenes and knockouts and subsequently cloned at the single cell level. Uniform expression of the transgenes and knockouts was confirmed, and clones were evaluated for their growth potential, genetic profile, differentiation potential into iNK cells, in vitro functionality, and in vivo performance (tumor growth inhibition, persistence and toxicity).
Our rationale for developing both iNK and iT allogeneic cell therapy platforms
We are initially focusing on two immune effector cell platforms, CAR-iNK and CAR-iT. We anticipate each platform will have a distinct biology that influences its function, and accordingly, the disease settings in which it is best suited for development. We view this dual development strategy as an opportunity to maximize the potential benefits of each platform and its associated immune cell. In the future, we may develop therapies that simultaneously incorporate both CAR-iNK and CAR-iT cells in the treatment of individual patients. We believe that gene engineering and control over differentiation during manufacturing may mitigate some of the liabilities of a given cell type while preserving the most desirable features. Examples of this include the potential reduction of the risk of graft-versus-host disease, or GvHD, in iT cells through the use of TCRs that are not expected to cause GvHD, which we refer to herein as Trusted
TCRs, or the potential extension of cell persistence of NK cells through the addition of cytokine signaling to promote survival. Finally, there are also clinical settings in which a putative shortcoming inherent to one cell type (e.g., short persistence of NK cells) might confer an advantage.
Ultimately, the development of both platforms enables a unique opportunity to merge the intrinsic biology of these lymphocyte subsets with desirable engineering attributes to tailor therapies best suited for the clinical path being pursued.

Development of CAR-NK and CAR-T platforms: distinct biology influences disease-specific applications
​
​
Our proprietary technology and differentiated approach
Advanced cell engineering expertise further differentiates our iPSC-derived allogeneic cell therapies
Our research and development team includes personnel with deep expertise in cell engineering. Cell engineering encompasses two critical components: genome engineering and protein engineering. We believe robust expertise in both these areas is of critical importance to realizing the potential of our iPSC-derived allogeneic cell therapy platforms. Genome engineering involves the manipulation of the cellular genome, through the use of genetic manipulation strategies including genetic knock-outs, knock-ins and HDR, to enable the creation of optimized cell products specifically tailored to address a particular disease. Protein engineering refers to the engineering and incorporation of CARs and other transgenes such as stimulatory cytokines, Allo-EvasionTM molecules, safety switches, and reporter proteins to generate highly functional cell therapies. We leverage these integrated capabilities to potentially enable our cell therapies to persist longer, to overcome detection by the host immune system and to elicit an enhanced therapeutic effect.
End-to-end development of product candidates
​
​

17



Common engineered iPSC progenitor
All of our product candidates include a set of core features designed to improve their functionality, safety profile, and persistence. These features include (i) our Allo-EvasionTM technology to enable the cells to avoid detection by the host immune system; (ii) a safety switch to allow for the rapid elimination of the cells from the patient if necessary;(iii) the inclusion of a homeostatic cytokine, IL-15, which promotes increased functionality and persistence in vivo, and is specific to NK cell therapy candidates; and (iv) a positron emission tomography, or PET, reporter molecule to allow for tracing of the distribution of cells upon administration, a capability we intend to include in our future product candidates. Our lead product candidate, CNTY-101, already incorporates the first three of these features. We have built all of these core features into a “common engineered iPSC progenitor” which is being utilized in the creation of a master cell bank. Further engineering to advance a development candidate for a specific target is then limited only to the addition of a CAR construct, allowing the generation of multiple product candidates targeting different indications from a single iPSC progenitor.
A single engineered iPSC progenitor can be used for multiple product candidates
​
​
Highly efficient engineering processes
We have designed highly efficient engineering processes to generate our product candidates. During the engineering process, we frequently combine the knock-out of specific genes with the knock-in of transgenes we seek to express. In the case of CNTY-101, our lead product candidate, we incorporate six gene edits into three engineering steps to combine the knock-out of two genes (beta-2-microglobulin, or β2m, and Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex Transactivator, or CIITA) with the knock-in of four transgenes (HLA-E, EGFR safety switch, IL-15, and CD19 CAR). The specific steps include (i) knock-out of β2m to eliminate HLA-I expression with the knock-in of HLA-E, (ii) knock-out of CIITA to eliminate HLA-II expression with the simultaneous knock-in of the EGFR safety switch and IL-15 and (iii) knock-in of the CAR construct into the adeno-associated virus insertion sequence 1, or AAVS1, locus.

Engineering steps used to generate our CNTY-101 product candidate
​
​
These modifications are enabled by our innovative use of advanced biological engineering tools and technologies coupled with the application of internal expertise. We use CRISPR-based nuclease to enable precise editing of the iPSC genome. For CNTY-101 we used the nuclease Cpf-1 but have shifted to CRISPR-MAD7 for all subsequent programs for commercial reasons. In addition to our license from Inscripta, Inc. to use CRISPR-MAD7, we also have a license from Inscripta, Inc. to access the sequence of the enzyme which allows us to develop proprietary protocols to produce and purify the enzyme in-house as well as optimize its use to edit the genome. We have optimized our use of CRISPR-MAD7 to enable CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination and repair of multiple edits per iPSC.

Advantages of our proprietary Allo-EvasionTM technology
We believe that our Allo-EvasionTM engineering technology will allow our cell product candidates to escape recognition and destruction by the host immune system. We believe the reduction in allogeneic reactivity enabled by our use of this technology will allow us to conduct repeat dosing of our CAR-modified cell therapies to improve their therapeutic potential. In combination with the extended killing capability of optimized immune cells derived from single genetically engineered cell cloning, we envision utilizing repeat dosing to maximize durability of response and efficacy. Additionally, we believe this technology may permit dosing in patients with limited or no immune preconditioning regimens.
The potential of Allo-EvasionTM using NK inhibitory ligands
​
​
Preventing recognition of allogeneic iNK cell product candidates by T cells and NK cells from immune competent recipients. Genetic knockout of genes necessary for HLA I and II molecule expression removes the targets of recognition by allogeneic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells respectively, but renders the cells susceptible to killing by recipient NK cells (middle panel). Introduction of the NK inhibitory ligand HLA-E into the product candidate (right panel) delivers a negative signal to recipient NK cells that protects them from elimination.
The combination of HLA-E and HLA-G improves protection against host NK cell killing

20



HLA-E and HLA-G engage different receptors on NK cells including NKG2A, KIRs, and LIRs. The expression of NKG2A, KIRs, and LIRs varies among NK cells from different donors. The addition of HLA-G provides further protection against NK cell rejection to protect the cell therapy product candidate from elimination.

Future generations of our cell therapies will embrace an extended range of capabilities
We envision future generations of our iPSC-derived allogeneic cell therapy platforms to incorporate additional capabilities. For instance, we are working on new approaches to lessen the effects of immunosuppressive cytokines, increase the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, improve tumor homing through engineered receptors, convert immune checkpoints into co-stimulatory signals and recruit and activate endogenous immunity. We believe therapeutic enhancements such as these may be particularly relevant to cell therapies intended to treat solid tumors. In addition, we intend to engineer into our iPSCs a PET reporter molecule to enable the imaging of the patient to trace the distribution of the administered cells.
Future product candidates will be designed to embrace a potentially extended range of capabilities
​
​
To achieve our objective of discovering, developing and ultimately commercializing innovative cell therapies to treat cancer, we believe our core competencies and capabilities must extend well beyond a knowledge of iPSCs. In addition to deep capabilities in cell engineering, we believe the expertise needed in-house must also include iPSC biology, oncology, immunology, and manufacturing which are essential to engineer and develop cell therapies that have a high likelihood of clinical success.
Manufacturing, product quality and COGS advantages
We believe our use of iPSCs, which have unlimited replicative capacity, will allow us to develop a streamlined manufacturing process with scalability advantages while producing consistent, high quality, off-the-shelf products at reduced manufacturing costs. Given the unlimited replicative capacity of iPSCs, we believe that a single master cell bank can be used for the lifetime of the product.
We intend to develop expertise in scale-up technologies to enable optimal manufacturing scale. To achieve this goal, we are building a team of process development engineers and scientists as well as manufacturing and quality staff with experience in scaling cell expansion, cell harvest and final product filling processes. In addition, we are leveraging knowledge from other modalities, such as allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cell therapies, live virus vaccines, and therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies, to identify and develop scalable technologies intended to enhance our manufacturing and production processes. We believe that these efforts will ultimately result in efficiencies of scale and reduced manufacturing costs for our products, if approved. We intend to increase our investment in scale-up technology as our product pipeline advances through development towards commercialization.

22



We are investing in internal manufacturing facilities and capabilities that we believe will enable us to analyze, learn and adapt more rapidly, reduce manufacturing costs and increase control of development and manufacturing timelines for efficient clinical development and, if approved, commercial production of our product candidates.
A key aspect of our investment in internal manufacturing facilities and capabilities includes the construction of our Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, manufacturing facility in Branchburg, New Jersey. We completed construction of this facility and it is now operational. This multi-product, multi-phase facility will has the capabilities and capacity to manufacture both iNK and iT cells, as well as other immune cell types, for complete optionality.
We believe that having access to our internal manufacturing facility, along with that of FCDI, will increase clinical supply availability and provide us with manufacturing and developmental flexibility. Furthermore, the expertise and learnings at each site can be leveraged for a greater probability of success on any project at either site. We believe this manufacturing network, along with our commitment to develop expertise in process scale-up and process understanding, will enable more efficient manufacturing and clinical development with lower cost of goods and consistent product quality.
Off-the-shelf commercialization opportunity for iPSC-derived allogeneic cell therapy platform derived product candidates
Allogeneic cells that can be cryopreserved offer the inherent advantage of off-the-shelf availability. Unlike autologous products, which cannot be produced until patient material is collected, the timing for manufacturing of allogeneic products is not dependent upon the patient. Primary donor cells can be collected and genetically modified well in advance of manufacturing, and manufacturing can be planned such that product is always readily available off-the-shelf for patients.
While cell therapies can be cryopreserved, cell quality may be negatively impacted by the freezing and thawing cycle. To combat this, we are making a significant investment in the development of robust and reliable freezing and thawing methods through rigorous examination of pre-freezing conditions that might affect the freeze/thaw, freezing parameters such as excipient types and concentrations, freezing temperature profiles, container configurations, and thawing conditions. The optimization of the many parameters that go into these steps will be enabled by the development of reliable quality testing procedures that measure the critical quality attributes of the product. We believe investing in these procedures and methods will help ensure that our cryopreserved cells maintain their quality through the freezing and thawing process.

iPSC-derived iNK cell platform
Multiple processes have evolved to allow for the differentiation of an iPSC into an immune cell. Many of these approaches involve platforms that use various signaling molecules, referred to as feeder cells, to facilitate iPSC differentiation. We have engineered our iNK cell platform so that that it is feeder cell-free, which simplifies the manufacturing process and further reduces manufacturing costs.
Differentiation of iPSCs to functional immune cells involves a series of process stages conducted under strictly controlled conditions, with different cytokine mixtures introduced at different process stages. IPSCs are initially differentiated into hematopoietic progenitor cells, or HPCs, during which they assemble into three-dimensional aggregates. Cells from these aggregates bud off and are replated onto different tissue culture vessels coated with a specific extracellular matrix and exposed to a cytokine cocktail that promotes differentiation of the HPCs to NK cells, a process that takes fourteen days. After differentiation, cells are incubated for seven days to activate the NK cells. We are currently capable of achieving fully functional iNK cells from iPSCs in 30 days.
The phenotype of iPSC-derived NK cells is similar to primary human NK cells
​
​
We have intentionally focused on the parameters that define immune cell functionality to direct internal development initiatives. This focus is intended to improve upon the intellectual property licensed from FCDI.
Accordingly, the parameters which have been the primary drivers of our activities have been cell persistence, killing potential and lack of induced toxicities, among other considerations. At the same time, we also characterize the cells phenotypically. As evidenced in the comparison presented above, NK cells derived from our iPSC- derived allogeneic cell therapy platforms are similar to primary human NK cells recovered from peripheral blood, with the phenotypic markers we evaluated displaying close alignment and the slight differences observed reflecting expected person-to-person variation.

25



Assessment of these cells’ functionality demonstrates their potential for tumor cell cytotoxicity. Through a series of in vitro studies we evaluated the various mechanisms through which iNK cells eliminate tumor cells. As is presented below, one of the mechanisms used by NK cells to kill tumor cells involves the recognition of tumor cells lacking HLA-I by innate immune receptors. Using a leukemic cell line, K562, that lacks HLA molecules, we noted that the cell killing capacity of our iNK cells closely mirrored that of NK cells isolated from peripheral blood.
Our iNK cells kill K562 tumor cells similarly to PBMC peripheral NK cells
​
​
Century’s iNK cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cell, or PBMC, NK cells were incubated with K562 tumor cells labelled with NuclightRed, or NLR, for 72 hours. Cocultures were imaged every 3 hours on the Incucyte live cell imager.
Upon cytolysis the target cells lose their NLR signal. Tumor cell index measures the density of tumor cells in the wells and is calculated as (tumor and iNK well at time x / tumor only well at time x) / (tumor and iNK well at first time point) * 100.
The addition of a CAR construct to the NK cell introduces a second mechanism by which tumor cells are eliminated. Our iPSC-derived NK cells demonstrated CAR-mediated tumor-cell killing of CD19 lymphoma cells, or Raji cells, comparable to peripheral blood CAR-Ts engineered with the same CAR construct.

26



Our CAR-iNK cells kill lymphoma cells similarly to peripheral blood CAR-T cells
​
​
Our CAR-iNK cells and peripheral blood CAR-T cells were incubated with Raji tumor cells labelled with NLR for 60 hours. Cocultures were imaged every 3 hours on the Incucyte live cell imager. Upon cytolysis the target cells lose their NLR signal. Tumor cell index measures the density of tumor cells in the wells and is calculated as (tumor and iNK well at time x / tumor only well at time x) / (tumor and iNK well at first time point) * 100.
Our iNK cells also demonstrate the ability to engage and kill cancerous cells through multiple challenge rounds. In an evaluation of sustained killing capability, the results of which are presented below, we observed that iNK cells were successful in eliminating lymphoma cells through seven killing cycles before evidence of cell exhaustion and a decrease in cytolytic activity was observed. These results suggest that not only are the cells capable of retaining functionality and the ability to proliferate, but that the cytolytic machinery and signaling mechanism connecting target recognition to effector immune cells maintains sustained durability as well.

27



Our CAR-iNK cells have robust serial killing activity against lymphoma cells
​
​
Our CAR-iNK cells were incubated with Reh tumor cells labelled with NLR for multiple rounds of killing. Every 72 hours, the iNK cells were transferred to new tissue culture wells containing fresh tumor cells and allowed to kill for 72 hours. Cocultures were imaged every 3 hours on the Incucyte live cell imager. Upon cytolysis the target cells lose their NLR signal. Tumor cell index measures the density of tumor cells in the wells and is calculated as (tumor and iNK well at time x / tumor only well at time x) / (tumor and iNK well at first time point) * 100. Loss in killing activity was observed between rounds seven and eight.
The tumor-killing potential of our iNK cells was confirmed through in vivo evaluations. Raji lymphoma cells were administered intravenously to mice that were then dosed three consecutive days with both non-engineered and CAR- modified iNK cells, which had also been engineered to express the IL-15 cytokine. Tumor growth was then monitored over the following 20 days. As is illustrated in the graph below, the CAR-IL15 iNK cells showed meaningful anti-tumor activity, with tumor growth inhibition shown to be as high as 84.7%. Notably this study was conducted using bulk engineered material, prior to single cell cloning, which we believe has the potential to enhance anti-tumor activity.

28

Average radiance, bioluminescence, or BLI of mice bearing intraperitoneal Daudi lymphoma xenografts, treated with CD19-CAR-iNK cells. Mice were implanted intraperitoneal with 1x105 cells Daudi-Fluc cells on Day 0 and CD19-CAR-iNK cells were administered intravenously at 1x107 cells per mouse on Days 1, 4, 8, 15, 18, and 22 as indicated by the arrows above.
In addition, to enhanced functionality, the engineered IL-15 has shown an identifiable benefit to persistence. As is presented in the illustration below, we observed viable iNK cells in the lungs and peripheral blood of mice 20 days after a single administration of CAR-iNK cells with IL-15, a result which was not noted in mice administered CAR- iNK cells without the addition of the cytokine.

29



The addition of a homeostatic cytokine significantly enhances iNK persistence
​
​
iNK cells were engineered to express a CD19-specific CAR molecule as well as secreted IL-15 to enhance iNK persistence in vivo. Mice received by intravenous injection: untreated (control), 1x107 CAR-iNKs (those lacking the secreted IL-15 [sIL-15] transgene), 1x107 CAR-iNKs-sIL-15, or 1x107 CAR-iNKs-sIL-15 plus additional recombinant IL-2 on days 1, 3 & 5 to enhance iNK persistence. In the upper panel A (peripheral blood) and the lower panel B (lungs), the presence of the sIL-15 transgene enhanced iNK persistence after 7 days. In both tissues, the addition of recombinant IL-2 via injection significantly enhanced persistence.
IPSC-derived iT cell platform
In addition to NK cells derived from our iPSC-derived allogeneic cell therapy platforms, we are also advancing the development of iPSC-derived T cells. The therapeutic properties offered by T cells, such as large in vivo expansion capacity, extended immune memory and the potential inclusion of engineered TCRs for additional tumor killing capacity, provide compelling reasons supporting their inclusion in our anti-cancer cell therapy arsenal. However, the development of allogeneic T cell-based therapies requires addressing unique challenges, such as GvHD. GvHD occurs when allogeneic donor T cells recognize an HLA class I and class II molecules on host cells and induce a severe and potentially life-threatening immune response against the host tissues. This is a challenge we plan to overcome by selecting Trusted TCRs that do not mediate GvHD.

30



We are exploring two major T cell subsets to develop our iT cell platform
​
​
Proprietary Trusted TCR constructs enable our generation of TrueTTM cells
Many companies that are pursing the development of allogeneic T cell therapies engineer T cell with an intentionally deleted TCR to eliminate the risk of GvHD. We have taken a fundamentally different approach; we believe that retention of the TCR is of significant importance, particularly to iPSC-derived T cells, as it helps with the differentiation and functionality of iPSC-derived T cells. We have devised strategies to utilize αβ or γδ TCRs on iPSC-derived T cells while minimizing risk of GvHD. In general, our approach capitalizes on selection of Trusted TCRs.
γδ T cells do not recognize hypervariable HLA class I or II receptors. Instead, γδ TCRs recognize ligands that are mostly invariant between individuals and these TCRs are unlikely to mediate GvHD. We leverage this characteristic of γδ chains to engineer iPSC lines with Trusted TCRs to create T-iPSC line that will be used to differentiate iT cell products. There are also special scenarios where an αβ TCR can have properties that lessen or eliminate the risk for GvHD, such in the case of some TCRs specific for viral antigens or the invariant αβ TCR expressed by, natural killer T cells, or NKT cells. We are pursuing γδ and αβ Trusted TCR approaches because γδ and αβ T cells have meaningfully different biological properties that can be explored for different tumor indications. Because of the importance of the TCR in normal T lymphocyte development, we call iPSC-derived T cells that express a Trusted TCR TrueTTM cells as a contrast to T cell engineered without a TCR.
For any TrueTTM cell approach there are two main strategies that can be deployed to make iPSC-derived T cells. The first is to begin with a T cell from a healthy donor where the TCR identity is known (either a γδ T cell, NKT cell or conventional αβ T cell). Such T cells can be isolated, expanded, and purified. Then the desired T cell, which carries the desired rearranged TCR genes, is reprogrammed to generate iPSCs that carry the same TCR genes. We call these T cell-derived iPSCs T-iPSCs and they can be used to produce T cells with the desired TCR. We have developed proof of concept for this approach using T-iPSC lines that were reprogrammed using peripheral blood γδ T cells. A second approach is to use iPSC that were derived from a non-T cell and thus lack a rearranged TCR. In this scenario, the desired TCR is selected and synthesized as a transgenic construct. Then the desired TCR is engineered into iPSCs such that T cells that are produced from the iPSCs will carry the engineered TCR. We have developed proof of concept for approached using an iPSC line that was derived from non-T cells, in this case CD34+ peripheral blood hematopoietic cells, where we introduced a viral-specific TCR.

31



Differentiation of TrueTTM cells results in cells that co-express TCR and CD3 and can utilize an engineered CAR for target cell killing
The process for differentiating T cells from iPSC is a multistage in vitro system that includes several growth factors and key ligands that mimic the developmental signals found in the human thymus where T cells normally develop. We have refined protocols to differentiate T cells from both T-iPSC and TCR-engineered iPSCs.
For γδ T cells, the current process yields T cells that uniformly express the γδ TCR and CD3. These iPSCs have been engineered to express a CD19 CAR for initial proof of concept studies. When the iPSC-derived γδ T cells are exposed to CD19-expressing lymphoma cells, the lymphoma cells are killed in an antigen-specific manner.
Differentiation of γδ CAR-iT cells from T-iPSC
​
​
A T-iPSC line that was derived from a Vγ9/Vδ2 γδ T cell was engineered with CRISPR to introduce the CAR transgene. The T-iPSC were then subjected to two sequential differentiation processes. A. First, the TiPSC were cultured under conditions that cause them to differentiate into CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) which have multilineage capability. B. Next, T lineage commitment was enforced during process 2 where the cells were differentiated into uniform CD3+ CD45+ CD7+ T cells over the course of 28 days. C. The day 28 T cells were assessed by flow cytometry and the data indicates that the cells express T lineage markers (CD3, CD7, and CD5) as well as the γδ T cell receptor but not the αβ T cell receptor. The T cells also retained high expression of the CAR molecule. 

32



γδ CAR-iT cells kill CD19-expressing lymphoma cells
​
​
CAR-iT cells were used in a tumor cell killing assay on an IncuCyte instrument. For this study, Reh cells, a CD19- expressing lymphoma line was used. PBMC CAR-T are PBMC-derived T cells that have been engineered to express the same CAR molecule, which have been added as a control for this study. When CD19-positive Reh cells were exposed to CAR-T cells, both iPSC-derived and PBMC-derived CAR-T cells mediated tumor killing.
For conventional αβ T cells, the current process yields iT cells that uniformly express the αβ TCR and CD3. These iPSCs were also engineered to express a CD19 CAR to evaluate their tumor cell killing activity. When the iPSC- derived αβ T cells were exposed to CD19-expressing lymphoma cells, the lymphoma cells were killed in an antigen- specific manner.
Differentiation of αβ CAR-iT cells from T-iPSC
​
​
A T-iPSC line that was derived from a αβ T cell was used to differentiate αβ T cells using a process that takes approximately five to six weeks. At the end of the process, cells were collected and stained for flow cytometry. The left panel demonstrates co-expression of CD3 and the αβ TCR on the cell surface of resulting iT cells. Because the T-iPSC line was also engineered with a CAR transgene, the CAR protein was also detected on the surface of these iT cells (right panel).

33



αβ CAR-iT cells kill CD19-expressing lymphoma cells
​
​
CAR-iT cells were used in a tumor cell killing assay on an IncuCyte instrument. For this study, Reh cells, a CD19- expressing lymphoma line was used. PBMC CAR-T are PBMC-derived T cells that have been engineered to express the same CAR, which have been added as a control for this study. When CD19-positive Reh cells were exposed to CAR-T cells, both iPSC-derived and PBMC-derived CAR-iT cells mediated tumor killing.
​
​
Serial killing of CD19+ tumor cells by CAR-γδ-iT cells is comparable to PBMC-derived CAR-T cells. The serial killing assay was performed using an Incucyte instrument where viable tumor cells expressed Nuclight Red and were enumerated every 3 hours based on Red Calibrated Units, or RCU, a measure of total red fluorescence. At the beginning of the culture, 1e5 CAR-γδ-iT or CAR-T were added to each well followed by addition of 2e4 NALM-6 target cells (Nuclight Red+). Cells were cultured in complete medium with 10 ng/ml rhIL-15. Every 24 hours, 2e4 fresh NALM-6 cells were added to the culture and data was recorded for 10 days. Increasing RCU indicates daily addition of new targets and/or outgrowth of tumor cells. Decreasing RCU indicates tumor cell killing by γδ CAR-iT cells or PBMC CAR-T cells.

34



Collectively, we have made significant progress in deriving iPSC lines that carry Trusted TCRs as well as refining the differentiation process to generate TrueTTM cells that express a TCR and a CAR. The cells mediate robust killing of lymphoma cells when their CAR is engaged. We believe that we have put in place the fundamental building blocks to continuing the advancement of our iT cell platform to generate iPSC-derived αβ and/or γδ T cell therapies for different tumor indications.

​
CNTY-101: Our CAR-iNK candidate targeting CD19 for relapsed, refractory B-cell lymphoma
Disease background
B-cell lymphoma is a cancer that affects B lymphocytes that make up part of the immune system. It generally originates in the lymph nodes. B-cell lymphoma includes both Hodgkin’s disease and approximately 80% to 85% of patients diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or NHL, a disease classification that includes more than 50 different hematological malignancies. In the United States, approximately 70,000 cases of NHL are diagnosed each year and the number of new diagnoses is increasing each year as the median age in the United States increases. 30-40% of these patients will relapse or have disease refractory to current treatments.
Current treatment and shortcomings
Treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is dependent on disease designation. Indolent disease may be treated with localized radiation or simply monitored for disease progression, at which time the disease is often treated with rituximab, with or without chemotherapy. Aggressive disease is treated with chemotherapy if diagnosed in the earlier stages of disease progression or with combination of rituximab and chemotherapy if diagnosed in the more advanced stages. While aggressive NHL is curable, indolent disease currently is not.
In aggressive large B-cell lymphomas, existing FDA-approved CD19 CAR-T cell therapies show overall response rates of 50-80%, complete response rates of 30-40%, and where longer term follow up data is available, a three year survival rate of 47%. They are also shown to be effective in aggressive and indolent 

36



lymphoma subpopulations and are in active testing in second line lymphoma. While these treatments have transformed care, significant medical need still exists in the relapsing and progressing patients that remain, with additional limitations of the autologous therapies described herein. As such, there is active investigation of several allogeneic B-cell targeting CAR-T therapies and B-cell targeting CAR-NK cell therapies in lymphoma.
Our therapeutic approach and development program
Our lead product candidate, CNTY-101, is an allogeneic, iPSC-derived CAR-iNK cell product for the treatment of CD19 positive B-cell lymphomas. CNTY-101 has been engineered with the following features:

● | expression of CD19 CAR to target malignant B cells, our CAR construct uses the FMC63 scFv and the signaling domains of CD28 and CD3ζ;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | knock-out of HLA-I and HLA-II to escape elimination by the patient’s CD8 and CD4 T cells;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | knock-in of HLA-E to avoid killing by the patient’s NK cells;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | expression of IL-15 to provide homeostatic cytokine support to improve persistence and functionality; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | incorporation of an EGFR safety switch to allow for elimination of the product if necessary.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The safety switch consists of a shorter version of the extracellular domain of EGFR, which binds to clinically approved antibodies, such as Cetuximab, which can trigger product elimination through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or ADCC, or antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, or ADCP.

37



We believe the modifications described above may lead to treatments with greater potency, persistency and durability. As the CD19 target and the FMC63-CD28z CAR have has been validated by existing FDA-approved CAR-T therapies, we believe target-related risks have been significantly diminished, as the approved CAR-T cell products have been shown to improve remission rates and improve overall survival in patients with various B-cell malignancies. The inclusion of a validated CAR construct in our first product candidate eliminates a key variable, i.e. the performance of a novel CAR construct, better enabling our Allo-EvasionTM engineered iNK platform to be validated in the initial studies. The validity of this therapeutic approach is further supported by a M.D. Anderson clinical trial of CAR-NK cells targeting CD19 used in the treatment of relapsed or refractory NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, patients. In that trial, eight of the 11 patients responded to treatment with seven patients achieving complete remission.

​
​
Left panel: engineered features of CNTY-101. Right panel: structure of the CD19 CAR construct used in CNTY-101
We completed engineering of iPSC lines from five different donors and single cell cloning of numerous iPSC lines. The single cell clones underwent genotype and phenotype identity, purity, safety, manufacturability, and in vitro and in vivo functional testing. CD19 iNK single cell clones demonstrate significant cytotoxicity in vitro comparable to CAR-T controls, and numerous cycles of serial killing after repeated challenge with lymphoma cells. CNTY-101 single cell clones also demonstrate IL-15 expression and persistence in vivo, as well as in vivo tumor growth inhibition. We received safe to proceed notification from the FDA in August 2022 and have advanced CNTY-101 into a Phase 1 clinical trial named ELiPSE-1, in which we began dosing patients in February 2023.
Preclinical studies and selection of the final product candidate for CNTY-101
To identify the CNTY-101 clinical candidate, we engineered iPSC lines from five different donors. The initial characterization studies were done with bulk cells prior to single cell cloning (bulk-engineered cells), and we generated additional data with single-cell clones. To identify the candidate, we narrowed down to six clonal cell lines derived from two donors. The initial evaluation of the Allo-EvasionTM features and safety switch was done on bulk-engineered iPSC lines.

To prevent recognition of our CAR-iNK cells by CD8 T cells from the patient, we eliminated the expression of the HLA-I by deleting β2m, a protein that is required for the expression of HLA-I molecules on the cell surface. Our current Allo-EvasionTM data has been generated with bulk-engineered iNK cells prior to single cell clonal selection. However, even with bulk-engineered cells where a small percentage of cells (1.6%) in the population still retains HLA-I, it is clear that the deletion of β2m significantly diminishes the allo-reactivity of allogeneic CD8 T cells against our iNK cells. In the final clinical candidate clones for therapeutic product candidates, HLA-I will be uniformly absent from all iNK cells.
Elimination of HLA-I prevents allogeneic immune recognition of iNK cells by CD8 T cells
​
​
Elimination of HLA-I prevents allogeneic immune recognition of iNK cells by CD8 T cells. To determine if removal of HLA-I via β2m knock-out prevents recognition of iNK cells by allogeneic T cells, a mixed lymphocyte reaction, or MLR, was performed with CD8 T cells from six allogeneic donors. Allogeneic T cells show virtual no proliferation when incubated with iNK cells that do not express HLA-I (B2Mko iNK), in contrast with iNK cells expressing HLA-I (iNK).
Deletion of HLA-I prevents the recognition of our iNK cells by allogeneic T cells, but on the other hand, it exposes the iNK cells to killing by the patient’s NK cells. NK cells can sense the lack of HLA-I as a danger signal (missing self- hypothesis) and eliminate HLA-I negative cells. As part of our Allo-EvasionTM technology, we engineered the expression of HLA-E, a monomorphic MHC Class I related molecule to prevent the killing of the HLA-I null iNK cells. HLA-E engages an inhibitory receptor, NKG2A on NK cells and prevents their cytolytic activity. Our data with engineered iNK cells indicates that HLA-E is effective in mitigating the killing of the null iNK cells.

Expression of HLA-E prevents killing of iNK cells that have been engineered to prevent HLA-I expression
​
​
iNK cells were derived from three different iPSC lines. A non-engineered iPSC line that carries an intact β2M gene was used to prepare iNK cells that are HLA-I+. A version of the same iPSC line was then engineered to knockout (KO) the gene β2M in order to ablate HLA-I expression. Finally, a version of the same iPSC line was engineered to both delete β2M and transgenically express the gene HLA-E. iNK cells that express HLA-I are mostly spared from lysis in an allogenic co-culture with PBMC (including NK cells) from two different donors. However, iNK cells lacking HLA-I (β2M KO) are lysed by NK cells. Finally, expression of HLA-E on iNK cells that lack other HLA-I molecules are spared from lysis by allogenic NK cells. 
Evaluation of the EGFR safety switch with bulk engineered CAR-iNK cells
CNTY-101 is engineered with a safety switch that can be triggered to eliminate the cells if ever necessary. Our switch includes a shorter version of the EGFR extracellular domain, anchored to the plasma membrane. This form of EGFR binds to cetuximab, a clinically approved antibody we plan to use as a trigger for the safety switch.
Cetuximab engages FcγR on innate immune cells, such as NK cells and macrophages, to eliminate EFGR- expressing cells through ADCC or ADCP. Our preliminary data from in vivo studies indicates that the cetuximab effectively triggers the elimination of iNK cells engineered with our EGFR safety switch from different tissues including blood, liver, and lungs.

Elimination of iNK cells using EGFR safety switch
​
​
NSG mice were intravenously infused with 1x107 CD19iNK and one day later treated with 40 mg/kg cetuximab or rituximab (as a control). On Day 8, mice were humanely euthanized and whole blood, liver, and lung samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of iNK cells.
Single-cell cloning of engineered iPSC from different donors to identify the final clinical candidate
We completed the single cell cloning of engineered iPSC lines from five different donors. The single cell clones were characterized for the expression of NK cell markers and the inserted transgenes. Selected clones were then characterized genetically by karyotype analysis, copy number variations, transgene copy number and insertion fidelity, and, finally, whole genome sequencing. The phenotype and genotype positive clones were progressed to an iNK differentiation, in vitro functional and manufacturability screens. We narrowed down the number of candidates to six clonal lines from two different donors. These lines were evaluated in vivo for final clinical candidate selection, and have advanced CNTY-101 into a Phase 1 clinical trial, ELiPSE-1, and began dosing patients in February 2023.

41



CNTY-101 lead discovery funnel to identify final clinical candidate
​
​
Selected single-cell clones express engineered transgenes in virtually all cells after expansion
We ran a series of phenotypic assays and transgene expression characterization to narrow down the list of top candidates to six iPSC lines. After expansion in culture, the cell populations derived from single cell clones are highly uniform. Virtually all cells from all clones are CD45+, CD56+, CD3- indicating that these cells are NK cells. In addition, the cells uniformly express the CAR, HLA-E, and EGFR (safety switch) transgenes indicating that our product candidate clones are highly uniform when assessed for phenotypic markers.

42



Transgene expression and purity of iNK cells
​
​
Transgene expression and purity of day 21 iNK clones as measured by flow cytometry. All clones were >97% iNK cells defined as live/CD45+/CD56+/CD3- (top left panel). Transgene expression (CAR, EGFR, and HLA-E) was measured on total live population after expansion of the single cell clones.
Functional analysis of iNK cells generated from individual iPSC clones reveals meaningful differences in the in vitro persistence and killing capacity of clinical candidates.
In addition to assuring uniform transgene expression in the clones under consideration for clinical candidate selection, we compared two in vitro functional attributes across clones that could influence their ability to inhibit tumor growth. The first is the cell-intrinsic capacity to persist in culture in the presence or absence of CD19 expressing tumor targets in the absence of exogenous cytokine support. As seen in the figure below, 

43



there was a meaningful difference between clones in the recovery of iNK cells after a seven day culture, with three clones demonstrating particularly favorable persistence.
​
Average iNK cell number as measured by flow cytometry at the conclusion of the 7 day persistence assay. iNK cells were cultured alone or in co-culture with CD19+ NALM6 or REH cells at an effector to target ratio of 1:1 in the absence of any exogenous cytokine support for 7 days and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The iNK cell population was defined as live, CD45+, CD56+cells.
Single-cell clones mediate serial killing of lymphoma cells
In addition to the persistence demonstrated above, for cell therapies to be effective in eliminating cancer cells, single CAR-T or CAR-NK cells need to be able to engage and kill multiple tumor cells in succession a process commonly described as serial killing. To evaluate the fitness of our CAR-iNK cells, we established a serial killing assay in which iNK cells are put through multiple rounds of killing with fresh tumor cell targets added every 24 hours. This is one of our most relevant in vitro assays to characterize and distinguish CAR-iNK cell clones. Our most potent clones sustain serial killing activity for over ten rounds of killing. These clones progressed to in vivo studies for characterization of their anti-tumor activity against human lymphoma xenografts. These in vivo studies determined the selection of the iPSC clone to generate the CNTY-101 clinical candidate.

44



Serial killing assay with single-cell iNK clones
​
​
​
To demonstrate the ability of our clonal CAR-iNK cells to kill lymphoma cells over multiple rounds of tumor challenge, NuclightRed labeled Nalm-6 CD19+ lymphoma cells were cocultured with iNK clones at an E:T ratio of 5:1. The plates were imaged every three hours to record the frequency of tumor cells by recording red fluorescence (Red Calibrated Unit, or RCU). Every 24 hours, new tumor cell targets were added to the wells. Differences in repeated killing are apparent with some clones having tumor serial killing for over ten rounds whereas others show loss of tumor control after five rounds of tumor killing.
Assessment of CNTY-101 inhibition of tumor growth in vivo
​
​

45



The anti-tumor activity of CNTY-101 was evaluated in vivo using fresh cultured CNTY-101 iNK cells or frozen cells. 1x105 luciferase-labeled NALM-6 lymphoma cells were administered IV on day zero. CNTY-101 iNK cells were given IV as fresh (10x106 cells) or cryo-preserved cells (15x106 cells) on Days 1, 8, and 15. Mice were imaged every 3-4 days using the IVIS SpectrumCT imager. CNTY-101 mediated significant anti-tumor growth inhibition when administered as fresh or cryo-preserved cells.
Single-cell clones eliminate CD19+ B cells
One of the key hallmarks of approved CD19 CAR-T cell therapy is the observation that patients who respond to treatment have B-cell aplasia (loss of B cells). Because normal B-cells express CD19, B-cell aplasia is expected during CD19 CAR-T cell treatment and has been used as a pharmacodynamic indicator of CAR-T cell activity. To determine whether our CD19 CAR-iNK cells eliminate normal B cells, we used B cells from four different allogeneic donors and incubated them with our top candidate iNK single cell clones. After 48 hours in culture, all iNK clones showed robust killing of B cells with complete elimination in most assays. This data indicates that B-cell aplasia should be expected during treatment of lymphoma patients. B-cell aplasia is expected to benefit our Allo-Evasion™ strategy by further reducing the chance of patients mounting a humoral anti-iNK cell antibody response.
Elimination of B Cells in Co-cultures of PBMCs with CAR-iNK Cells Derived from Single-Cell Clones
​
​
Elimination of normal B cells from whole PBMCs by our top candidate iNK single-cell clones. To evaluate B-cell killing activity in-vitro, CAR-iNK cells derived from six single-cell clones were co-cultured for 48 hours with PBMCs from four healthy donors. The PBMCs were labeled with cell trace violet (CTV) and cocultured with CAR-iNK clones at an effector: Target ratio of 1:1. B-cells were defined as CTV+/CD45+/CD19+ and the reduction in B-cell numbers graphed as a percentage of the total B-cells present in the co-culture conditions compared to the “No Effector” condition for each donor (set at 100%). Samples were run on BD Symphony A3 cytometer and the data is represented as average of the four PBMC donors with error bars representing standard deviation.

Our CNTY-101 clinical development program
We believe the successful development of CNTY-101 will enable us to establish clinical proof of concept for our CAR- iNK cell therapy and Allo-EvasionTM technology. the clinical development of the program
We have initiated a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial of CNTY-101 in the United States, in relapsed and refractory CD19 positive large B-cell lymphoma, or RR NHL, patients including dose escalation and expansion portions, designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, persistence, efficacy, and recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule of CNTY-101. We are assessing both CD19-naïve and CD19-CAR-T treated patients who have relapsed following at least 2 prior lines of therapy. We will evaluate two dosing schedules, beginning with single dosing in Schedule A, as shown below. We will also characterize multiple doses per cycle with repeat cycles without subsequent lymphodepletion, subject to the Independent Data Review Committee and FDA review, and its potential impact on safety, persistence, and efficacy in Schedule B. The ongoing ELiPSE-1 trial is designed to evaluate preliminary safety and efficacy in patients. We intend to establish proof of concept as the study progresses through dose escalation, which will be analyzed when sufficient patient data is achieved. The CNTY-101 clinical trial will allow for benchmarking, where safety and efficacy outcomes can be compared to the available results for mono-specific CD19 autologous and allogeneic therapies that also utilize the FMC63 binder and CAR.
The primary objective of the Phase 1 clinical trial is to evaluate incidence and nature of dose-limiting toxicities within each dose level cohort and establish the recommended Phase 2 dose. The secondary objectives of the study include cell pharmacokinetics and persistence, incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events, overall response rate, complete and partial response rates, and duration of response, among other measures. Exploratory measures include evaluation of immunogenicity, correlation of antigen expression with response, and cytokine profile as a reporter of safety.
We believe CNTY-101 may provide significant treatment advantages including (i) as a result of our ability to repeat dose, the potential to enhance objective response rates, or ORRs, and the duration of response, or DoR; (ii) the potential to treat patients immediately upon diagnosis since product is available off-the-shelf; and (iii) the potential to use milder lymphodepletion regimens by reducing or eliminating the immunogenicity and alloreactivity of the administered cells, potentially providing an improved safety profile. Off the shelf availability of CNTY-101 at any clinical site, and, a potentially improved safety profile enabling outpatient use, could improve patient access. For these reasons, we believe CNTY-101, if approved by the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities, will address substantial unmet market needs for an off-the-shelf, safe and effective cell therapy offering an improved therapeutic profile.
ELiPSE-1: First in human study of CNTY-101 Trial Schema

A. Escalation guided by the Bayesian Optimal Interval, or BOIN. The safety review committee reviews data and implements dosing decisions. B. After the single dose maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, has been reached or the maximum single dose has been evaluated, or earlier upon the recommendation of the Independent Data Review Committee and Sponsor decision, Schedule B will also be explored (i.e., given weekly for three weeks), starting with a fractionated dose of approximately one-third of the MTD.
CNTY-102: CAR-iT candidate targeting CD19 + CD22 for relapsed, refractory B-cell lymphoma and other B-cell malignancies
Our next-generation product candidate directed to treat B-cell malignancies is CNTY-102, an iPSC-derived Allo- EvasionTM technology enabled, CAR-iT cell therapy designed to simultaneously target two tumor antigens, CD19 and CD22. CNTY-102 will also be engineered with homeostatic cytokine support, a safety switch to be utilized for cell elimination if required clinically and possibly a PET reporter for imaging of the cells after administration to the patients. Our use of a multi-targeted CAR is intended to increase depth and durability of response by eliminating the effect of CD19 antigen loss that has been observed as a factor limiting durability of CAR-T cell therapies, as well as taking advantage of targeting CD22, an independently regulated, ubiquitous and validated B-cell target.

48



CNTY-102
​
 
iT cells are expected to have high proliferative capacity, persistence, and trafficking, leading to sustained anti-tumor activity. We will develop this candidate on our γδi iT cell therapy platform. 
We anticipate preliminary clinical safety, translational (exploratory biomarker) and efficacy data will be emerging from the CNTY-101 Phase 1 trial at the time we plan to file the CNTY-102 IND, which will allow us to refine the CNTY-102 clinical design and allow for an in depth comparison. We intend to evaluate CNTY-102 in a Phase 1 clinical trial in relapsed, refractory aggressive B-cell NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, and/or B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or B-ALL. We will assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, persistence, and efficacy outcomes, with primary objectives of the Phase 1 to evaluate and compare depth and durability of response, as we believe dual tumor antigen targeting will significantly improve the efficacy profile. Additional Phase 1 objectives include determining the recommended Phase 2 clinical trial dose, schedule, and lymphodepletion conditions.
CNTY-107: Our CAR-iT candidate targeting Nectin-4, for solid tumors expressing high levels of the target antigen
CNTY-107 is an iPSC-derived Allo- EvasionTM technology enabled, CAR-iT cell therapy designed to address Nectin-4 positive solid tumors. CNTY-107 will also incorporate additional functionalities to enhance tumor cell killing and improve cell fitness. The Nectin cell adhesion protein 4 (Nectin-4) is overexpressed in multiple malignancies and has emerged as a possible biomarker and has been validated as target through antibody drug conjugate (ADC) approaches such as enfortumab vedotin. Nectin-4 is overexpressed in tumor types including urothelial, colorectal, breast, lung, ovarian, gastric, esophageal and pancreatic cancer.

CNTY-104: Our CAR-iNK or CAR-iT multi-specific collaboration program for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia 
Disease background
AML is the most common form of acute leukemia, with 20,000 patients per year diagnosed in US. AML is an aggressive, heterogeneous hematopoietic malignancy characterized by genetic abnormalities in myeloid stem cells. 5-year overall survival, or OS, among patients with AML aged <60 years is ~ 35%, with 5-year OS among patients >60 years ~ 11%, reflecting a high unmet need to improve survival and quality of life for the majority of patients with AML. First line therapy includes a combination of cytarabine- and anthracycline-based regimens with allogeneic stem cell transplantation for eligible candidates, and recently approved, targeted therapies for specific mutations. Approximately 50% of patients relapse after achieving a complete remission in AML, leading to a poor prognosis. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, or Allo-HCT, after achieving a second remission, likely offers the only possible current chance for cure. Despite numerous clinical studies, outcomes are consistently disappointing with 5-year overall survival rates of ~ 10%.
Our therapeutic approach
We are developing a multi-specific CAR-iNK or CAR-iT cell collaboration program to treat relapsed, refractory, and secondary AML in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. CNTY-104 is a CAR-iNK or CAR-iT collaboration program designed to target at least two tumor- associated antigens of relevance in AML. We are currently investigating multiple tumor targets to select the final candidates for the CNTY-104 collaboration 

50



program. CNTY-104 will include a safety switch and possibly additional modifications including a PET reporter for imaging of the cells after administration to the patients.
​
​
Use of CAR-T cell therapies have been limited to date in myeloid malignancies due to the heterogeneity of AML cells, and, the absence of antigens that are not also expressed on normal hematopoietic stem progenitor cells. Cell therapy approaches targeting these specific antigens have often led to prolonged myeloablation, causing risk of infection and transfusion dependence in patients. As such, we are planning to create a multi-specific CAR-iNK or iT product that allows for controlled dosing and controlled persistence (e.g. enabling resting periods) to enable elimination of AML blasts while mitigating toxicities to the bone marrow. This approach may provide an improvement in treatment efficacy, tolerability, and safety. There may be an advantage to evaluate an iNK cell product, pending characterization of in vivo pharmacokinetics and persistence, but we will evaluate both cell platforms to engineer CNTY-104. 
CNTY-106: Our CAR-iNK or CAR-iT multi-specific collaboration program for the treatment of multiple myeloma 
Disease background
Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematological malignancy, accounting for approximately 10 percent of all blood cancers. The five-year survival rate has improved with the introduction of targeted therapies, combination regimens and more recently antibody drug conjugates and cell therapies but remains incurable. An estimated 35,000 new cases are diagnosed in the U.S. annually, with approximately 12,500 deaths. The 5-year survival rate for patients under 45 years of age at diagnosis is approximately 77 percent. 
We are developing a multi-specific CAR-iNK or CAR-iT cell product candidate to treat relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. CNTY-106 is a CAR-iNK or CAR-iT collaboration program to target at least two tumor- associated antigens of relevance in multiple myeloma. 
Discovery platform
In addition to our named programs, we are actively engaged in a number of earlier stage discovery programs where we believe our IPSC-derived allogeneic cell therapy platform may provide differentiated therapeutic 

51



benefits. These discovery stage initiatives are focused on several solid tumor indications including bladder cancer and renal cell carcinoma. For these indications we plan to use multi-specific CARs and explore the use of both iNK and iT cells to identify the best cell platform to build the product candidate.
We have initiated multiple VHH antibody campaigns to identify binders to build the CAR constructs for the prioritized tumor indications. These campaigns are at different stages of development and include targets for targets for renal cell carcinoma and other solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Our goal is to do side by side comparisons of the different CARs to select the final CAR constructs for the product candidates. We intend to evaluate the use of engineered macrophages and dendritic cells in the future as potential anti- cancer cell therapies. We believe the function of these immune cells may enable both standalone use as well as their inclusion in potent effector cell cocktails where the complementary engagement of the different immune cells reinforces and enhance overall therapeutic efficacy against different type of tumor malignancies.
Manufacturing
We believe that our iPSC-derived NK cells and T cells afford us a significant opportunity to advance multiplex gene- edited cell therapies that can be produced at substantially lower cost and accessible by a much larger patient population as compared to other donor-derived and autologous cell therapy approaches. To capitalize on these advantages, we believe it is imperative to develop an intimate understanding of the relevant cell types, the processes used to manufacture these cells, and the analytical methods required to accurately and reliably measure critical product attributes. We believe this understanding will enable us to produce safe and efficacious products, implement process and product changes with greater efficiency and accelerate the clinical development of commercializable products. In addition, we intend to develop a significant depth of expertise related to scale manufacturing, which we believe is essential to enable cell expansion, harvest and final container filling, along with cryopreservation, at a significantly reduced per dose cost. We have constructed our manufacturing strategy with the intent of achieving these objectives.
We believe that our relationship with FCDI and its role in the manufacture of our initial product candidates has provided valuable know-how that accelerated development of our proprietary methods to generate functional iPSC- derived iNK cells. We believe that our optimized iPSC differentiation methods are scalable and compatible with efficient manufacturing processes. Our process development group is responsible for overall management of process optimization efforts and we have contracted with FCDI to provide us with process development services on an ongoing basis.
Current activities with FCDI are focused on enhancements to NK cell production. As the protocols for cryopreservation of NK cells are not as well established as the protocols for T cell freezing and storage, we believe that addressing the key determinants of cryopreservation is of particular relevance to the success of our more advanced therapeutic programs. The ability of NK cells to withstand cryopreservation depends not only on the freezing step itself, but on multiple factors in the entire manufacturing process both preceding and following freezing, including the thawing process and post-thaw handling prior to patient administration. As such, all factors involved in the supply chain, from initial cell engineering to patient administration, are being addressed to characterize the impact of cryopreservation on NK cells, especially its impact on yield, activity, stability and consistency. We have invested significant resources to optimize our manufacturing process and continue to iteratively invest in this area. We are also committing additional resources to ensure that adequate infrastructure and expertise is available at clinical sites regarding handling and treatment preparation.

52



Effective cryopreservation strategies must consider all elements of the supply chain
​
​
We are sourcing clinical supply of CNTY-101 from FCDI. FCDI currently maintains a cGMP compliant manufacturing facility in Madison, Wisconsin and our audit of the facility confirmed its Phase 1 readiness. We also intend to source clinical trial supply for our other iNK product candidates, and we will have the option to source NK cell therapies to be sold commercially, if approved, from FCDI. 
At the same time, we have constructed of our own 53,000 square foot cell therapy manufacturing facility in Branchburg, New Jersey. which is now operational. While we intend to use this facility as the primary manufacturing site for CAR-iT cell therapies, we have designed the facility to be a flexible, multi-product facility, capable of producing any immune cell type, and thereby serving as an alternative manufacturing site for our CAR-iNK cell therapies as well.
We believe the development of in-house manufacturing will enable us to analyze, learn and adapt more rapidly and increase control of development and manufacturing timelines for efficient clinical development of our product candidates. Through this enhanced control and investment in our process and analytical development capabilities, we believe we will gain a deeper understanding of our critical product attributes and better understand the factors that affect product quality. We also intend to develop expertise in scale-up technologies to enable optimal manufacturing scale for our product candidates, which will reduce cost of goods and improve patient access.

Manufacturing Agreement
Under the Manufacturing Agreement, FCDI will perform certain agreed upon technology transfer, process development, analytical testing, and cGMP manufacturing services for us with respect to clinical supply of our product candidates as agreed to in future work orders. The Manufacturing Agreement contains certain exclusivity provisions, which remain effective until the fifth anniversary of the Manufacturing Agreement, including that FCDI will be our exclusive clinical supplier for the first NK cell product candidate for which we submit an IND and that FCDI will have the option to be our exclusive clinical supplier for certain of our next three or four product candidates for which we may submit an IND, depending on whether they are NK cell product candidates or T cell product candidates. Subject to certain conditions, FCDI may also have the right to be the exclusive clinical supplier for the first product candidate for which we submit an IND after the fifth anniversary of the Manufacturing Agreement.
Either party may terminate the Manufacturing Agreement upon the other party’s material breach, subject to a 30-day notice and cure period, or in the event that the activities to be performed under the Manufacturing Agreement are unable to be performed for scientific or technical reasons and the parties are unable to resolve such issue within 60 days. We may terminate the Manufacturing Agreement for convenience after March 23, 2026 by providing FCDI 60-days’ written notice.
Bayer HealthCare LLC
Option Agreement
In June 2019, we entered into an option agreement with Bayer, or the Option Agreement, which was subsequently amended and restated in February 2021, pursuant to which Bayer was granted certain bidding rights relating to the potential transfer of rights with respect to certain product candidates being researched and developed by us which are comprised of allogeneic iPSC-derived natural killer cells, macrophages or dendritic cells, which we refer to as the Research Products. For clarity, T cell programs are excluded from the Bayer Option Agreement Research Products. Under the Option Agreement, Bayer was granted a right of first refusal, or ROFR, to submit bids for the transfer or license of rights to research, develop and/or commercialize certain Research Products, which we refer to as the Research Product Rights.. While CNTY-101 is no longer included in the Bayer option rights, any other wholly owned product candidate comprised of iNK cells that we develop in the future is subject to the terms of the Option Agreement. Bayer’s ROFR is only exercisable with respect to up to four Research Products and the right terminates upon our tenth IND submission. Subject to certain exceptions, Bayer may only exercise these option rights in a non-sequential and alternating manner, and such rights are subject to additional limitations.
In the event that Bayer exercises its ROFR right, we will provide Bayer with our current, minimum offer terms with respect to the relevant Research Product Rights, or the Minimum Offer Terms, as determined by our Board (excluding any director appointed by Bayer), which will include (i) the minimum upfront cash proceeds to be received by us for the Research Product Rights and (ii) any other applicable licensing and financial terms. If Bayer’s bid does not meet the Minimum Offer Terms, Bayer’s ROFR rights with respect to that Research Product terminate except that Bayer will retain topping rights for future third party bids for that Research Product. If Bayer’s bid meets the Minimum Offer Terms, we can accept the bid or seek a third party valuation to determine the fair market value of the Research Product Rights and Bayer will have the opportunity to match the third party valuation. If Bayer does not match the third party valuation, Bayer’s rights with respect to that Research Product terminate except that Bayer will retain topping rights for future third party bids for that Research Product that are less than the third party valuation. The Option Agreement also contains provisions regarding our receipt of an unsolicited bid for certain Research Product Rights prior to an IND submission for a Research Product under which Bayer will have the option to submit a competing bid or relinquish its rights with respect to the transfer of the applicable Research Product in connection with the unsolicited bid.

56



The Option Agreement terminates upon the earlier of (i) Bayer and its affiliates ceasing to hold any of our capital stock or (ii) a change of control of us, as defined therein. The Option Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and confidentiality provisions.
Bristol-Myers Squibb
On January 7, 2022, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb to collaborate on the research, development and commercialization of iNK and iT cell programs for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, each a Collaboration Program, and each product candidate developed within such Collaboration Program, a Development Candidate.
Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we and Bristol-Myers Squibb will initially collaborate on two Collaboration Programs and Bristol-Myers Squibb has the option to add up to two additional Collaboration Programs, for an additional fee. The initial two Collaboration Programs are focused on AML and multiple myeloma, respectively. The two additional Collaboration Programs that Bristol-Myers Squibb may elect to add to the collaboration will focus on targets chosen from a set of reserved targets or other targets selected by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which can be nominated subject to certain conditions agreed with us and outlined in the Collaboration Agreement.
Under the Collaboration Agreement, we are responsible for generating Development Candidates for each Collaboration Program with a goal of producing Development Candidates that meet pre-specified criteria. Bristol-Myers Squibb has the option, exercisable for a specified period of time after the Development Candidate for each Collaboration Program is deemed to meet the applicable criteria, to elect to exclusively license the Development Candidates created in each Collaboration Program for pre-clinical development, clinical development and commercialization on a worldwide basis each a License Option. Following Bristol-Myers Squibb’s exercise of the License Option with respect to a Collaboration Program, we will be responsible for performing IND-enabling studies, supporting Bristol-Myers Squibb’s preparation and submission of an IND and manufacturing of clinical supplies until completion of a proof of concept clinical trial for the relevant Development Candidates, in each case at pre-agreed rates. Bristol-Myers Squibb will be responsible for all regulatory, clinical, manufacturing (after the proof of concept clinical trial) and commercialization activities for such Development Candidates worldwide. 
We have the option to co-promote with Bristol-Myers Squibb Development Candidates generated from the initial AML Collaboration Program and, if Bristol-Myers Squibb elects to expand to a fourth Collaboration Program, Development Candidates generated from the fourth Collaboration Program.
Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Bristol-Myers Squibb made a non-refundable, upfront cash payment of $100 million and will pay an exercise fee upon the exercise of the License Option with respect to a Collaboration Program, each such Collaboration Program, a Licensed Program and product candidates developed under a Licensed Program, Licensed Products. With respect to each Licensed Program, Bristol-Myers Squibb will pay up to $235 million in milestone payments upon the first achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones within such Licensed Program. In addition, Bristol-Myers Squibb will pay up to $500 million per Licensed Product in net sales-based milestone payments. 
Bristol-Myers Squibb will also pay us tiered royalties per Licensed Product as a percentage of net sales in the high-single digits to low-teens, subject to reduction for biosimilar competition, compulsory licensing and certain third party licenses costs. If we exercise our co-promote option, such royalty percentage will be increased to low-teens to high-teens in respect of the sales of the co-promoted Licensed Products in the United States. The royalty term shall terminate on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis on the latest of (i) the twelve (12) year anniversary of the first commercial sale of such Licensed Product in such country, (ii) the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity period that covers such Licensed Product in such country, and (iii) the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent of the Company or a jointly owned patent that covers such the Licensed Product in such country. After expiration of the applicable 

57



royalty term for a Licensed Product in a country, all licenses granted by the Company to Bristol-Myers Squibb for such Licensed Product in such country will be fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable.
In connection with the Collaboration Agreement Bristol-Myers Squibb purchased 2,160,760 shares of the our common stock at a price per share of $23.14, for an aggregate purchase price of $50 million.
iCELL Inc.
On March 20, 2020, we entered into an exclusive sublicense, or the iCELL Sublicense, with iCELL Inc., or iCELL, for certain patents related to an immune function reconstruction method using multipotent stem cells and the method for producing antigen specific T-cells, in each case, to research, develop and commercialize products in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK and any other countries where valid claims exist. Additionally, we received a non-exclusive license to such rights in Japan. The rights sublicensed to us under the iCELL Sublicense were licensed to iCELL by the University of Tokyo, or UTokyo, pursuant to an exclusive license agreement, or the UTokyo License. iCELL reserved for itself and for UTokyo an irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license to make and use certain non-public information for their own internal educational and research activities.
The initial term of the sublicense expires on the later of (i) March 31, 2027, or (ii) the expiration of the last-to- expire valid claim covering a licensed product, which is currently expected to expire in 2033. iCELL may terminate the agreement with 30 days’ notice if we have failed to make a payment within 60 days of such payment becoming due and we do not cure such breach within 30 days of written notice. We may terminate the agreement upon 90 days’ written notice if any third party brings a claim against us related to the licensed patents or technology and such claim is not settled within 90 days.
Pursuant to the iCELL Sublicense, we paid an upfront license issue fee in the low six-figures and we agreed to make low single-digit percentage royalty payments until the last-to-expire valid claim under the licensed patents to iCELL on certain net sales amounts of the products developed under the iCELL Sublicense, as well as commercial milestone payments on a country-by-country basis based on certain net sales amounts related to products developed under the iCELL Sublicense in the aggregate of $70 million. We also agreed to make certain milestone payments to iCELL upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones in the aggregate of $4.25 million. Upon the termination of the UTokyo License, iCELL will use good faith efforts to assist us in exercising any rights available to us under the UTokyo License to become a direct licensee of UTokyo. The iCELL Sublicense also contains customary representation and warranties, confidentiality, insurance, audit, indemnification and miscellaneous provisions.
University of Toronto and McMaster University
On June 9, 2020, we entered into an asset purchase agreement by and among Empirica, our wholly-owned subsidiary Century Therapeutics Canada ULC, or Century Canada and us pursuant to which we purchased certain assets of Empirica, including a license agreement, or the Empirica License, dated January 22, 2019, by and among the Governing Council of the University of Toronto, or the Council, the McMaster University, or, together with the Council, the Toronto Universities, and Empirica. Under the Empirica License, we received an exclusive, non- transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain patents and antibody sequences and related intellectual property rights and know-how to, among other things, reproduce, manufacture and commercialize certain CD-133 related antibody and antibody sequence-derived technology, including but not limited to BiTE and bi-Specific or engineered T-Cells, including but not limited to CAR-Ts. The Toronto Universities reserve a royalty- free, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license to use such technology for non-commercial research, educational and administrative purposes.
The Empirica License expires upon the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim covering the antibody and antibody-derived technology licensed under the agreement, which, if issued, is expected to expire in 2037. The Toronto Universities may immediately terminate the agreement upon certain insolvency events or upon 

58



our material breach with 30 days’ prior written notice and cure period. We may terminate the agreement for convenience upon 30 days’ written notice.
Pursuant to the Empirica License, we are required to make aggregate milestone payments of $18 million to the Toronto Universities upon the achievement of regulatory approval for certain products developed pursuant to the Empirica License in the United States, European Union and Japan until the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim covering the antibody and antibody-derived technology licensed under the agreement. We are also required to make royalty payments to the Toronto Universities in an amount equal to a low single-digit percentage of annual net sales of any product commercialized utilizing technology licensed under the Empirica License. We are also required to pay the Toronto Institutions 50% of all non-royalty payments from sublicenses up to certain maximum amounts and 50% of royalty payments from sublicenses up to a maximum low single-digit percentage. The Empirica License contains customary representations and warranties, confidentiality, insurance, audit and indemnification provisions.
Inscripta
In January 2019, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with Inscripta, Inc. Under the license agreement, we obtained a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable license to a patent portfolio covering the composition, production and use of CRISPR-MAD7, a novel gene-editing CRISPR endonuclease from the Eubacterium rectale genome. The license agreement does not contain any payment terms; thus no payments have been made, or will be made, to Inscripta under the license agreement. The licensed intellectual property includes two issued U.S. patents and any pending applications claiming priority therefrom. Our license covers the use of CRISPR-MAD7 to perform research and development in both academic and commercial setting and use of MAD7 to perform commercial services, provided that such use may not include the (i) sale or resale of MAD7, including as part of a therapeutic product, (ii) continued use of MAD7 in a commercial manufacturing process or (iii) use of MAD7 in the editing of human embryos. Such license will expire upon the expiration of the last valid claim under the licensed patents, which is currently expected to expire in 2037. These licensed issued patents and any licensed patents that may issue from these pending patent applications will expire in 2037, without giving effect to any patent term adjustment or extension.
Intellectual property 
Intellectual property is of vital importance in our field and in biotechnology generally. We seek to protect and enhance our intellectual property, proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining, enforcing and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties.
We do not own any issued patents covering our product candidates, platforms or technology and our patent portfolio is currently comprised only of patent applications. We have filed patent applications related to our product candidates CNTY-101, CNTY-102 and CNTY-107, but have not yet filed any patent applications on our other product candidates. We have also filed patent applications relating to our T-cell platform related to compositions and methods for generating alpha-beta and gamma delta T-cells from iPSCs. Additionally, we have filed a patent application on gene transfer vectors and methods of engineering iPSCs. We have sought patent protection in the United States related to our CNTY-101 product candidate, as well as other iPSC-derived engineered CAR cells comprising certain transgene insertions and deletions, including our proprietary Allo-Evasion™ technology. This portfolio covers compositions of programmed cellular immunotherapies, our proprietary Allo-Evasion™ technology and our platform for industrial scale iPSC engineering and differentiation. The portfolio also includes technology for a universal CAR cell platform and a novel safety switch. With regard to such United States provisional patent applications, if we do not timely file any non- provisional patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent applications. Such applications may not result in issued patents and, even if patents do issue, such patents may not be in a form that will provide us with meaningful protection for our product candidates. We also rely on trade secrets that 

59



may be important to the development of our business, but which may be difficult to protect and provide us with only limited protection.
We expect to file additional patent applications in support of current and new clinical candidates as well as new platform and core technologies. Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining, maintaining, protecting and enforcing patent protection and trade secret protection of our current and future product candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending such patents against third-party challenges and operating without infringing, violating or misappropriating the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others. Our ability to stop unauthorized third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property.”
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional or Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any issued patents we may obtain in any jurisdiction where such patent term extensions are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property.”
In some instances, we submit patent applications directly with the USPTO as provisional patent applications. Corresponding non-provisional patent applications must be filed not later than 12 months after the provisional application filing date to claim priority to the provisional application filing date. With regard to such United States provisional patent applications, if we do not timely file any non-provisional patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent applications. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage.
We will file U.S. non-provisional applications and PCT applications that claim the benefit of the priority date of earlier filed provisional applications, when applicable. The PCT system allows a single application to be filed within 12 months of the original priority date of the patent application, and to designate all of the PCT member states in which national patent applications can later be pursued based on the international patent application filed under the PCT. The PCT searching authority performs a patentability search and issues a non-binding 

60



patentability opinion for some or all of the claims filed in the application, which can be used to evaluate the chances of success for the national applications in foreign countries prior to having to incur the filing fees. Although a PCT application does not issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek protection in any of the member states through national- phase applications. At the end of the period of two and a half years from the earliest priority date of the PCT application, separate patent applications can be pursued in any of the PCT member states either by direct national filing or, in some cases by filing through a regional patent organization, such as the European Patent Office. The PCT system delays expenses, allows a limited evaluation of the chances of success for national/regional patent applications and enables substantial savings where applications are abandoned within the first two and a half years of filing.
For all patent applications, we determine claiming strategy on a case-by-case basis. We seek to file patents containing claims for protection of all useful applications of our proprietary technologies and any product candidates, as well as all new applications and/or uses we discover for existing technologies and product candidates, assuming these are strategically valuable. We continuously reassess the number and type of patent applications, as well as the pending and issued patent claims to pursue maximum coverage and value for our processes, and compositions, given existing patent office rules and regulations. Further, claims may be modified during patent prosecution to meet our intellectual property and business needs.
We recognize that the ability to obtain patent protection and the degree of such protection depends on a number of factors, including the extent of the prior art, the novelty and non-obviousness of the invention, and the ability to satisfy the enablement requirement of the patent laws. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted or further altered even after patent issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates, platform or technology. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. In addition, any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing, violating or misappropriating the intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties. Third-party patents could require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our product candidates or processes, obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or cease certain activities. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. Further, our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our product candidates may have a material adverse impact on us. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how, other proprietary information and/or continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention 

61



assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting trade secrets, know-how and inventions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property.”
Intellectual property relating to iPSC technology
We have licensed from FCDI a portfolio of six patent families including issued patents and pending applications broadly applicable to the reprogramming of somatic cells. Our license is non-exclusive within the field of cancer immunotherapeutics in the worldwide territory outside of Japan. This portfolio covers various aspects of the generation of human iPSCs from somatic cells and, as of May 31, 2021, includes 12 issued U.S. patents claiming methods and compositions used in the reprogramming of human somatic cells to iPSCs. Specifically, the portfolio includes patents with claims for producing human iPSCs from hematopoietic progenitor cells using episomal genetic vectors and includes claims for doing the reprogramming under feeder free conditions. The portfolio also includes a composition of matter patent issued in the United States covering an Epstein-Barr Virus, or EBV, reprogramming vector containing genes for certain reprogramming factors. These issued patents and any patents that may issue from these pending patent applications will expire on dates ranging from 2029 to 2034, without giving effect to any patent term adjustment or extension.
Included within the license is a sublicense under certain patents, which are directed to compositions and methods of using and making iPSCs, owned by WARF relating to the so-called “Thompson Factors” for reprogramming human cells to iPSCs, The issued United States patents in this portfolio will expire on dates ranging from 2028 to 2029, without giving effect to any patent term adjustment or extension.
Given that the rights granted to us under these patents are non-exclusive, third parties may obtain licenses to these patents and related technology to compete with us. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks related to commercialization of our product candidates—We face significant competition, and if our competitors develop product candidates more rapidly than we do or their product candidates are more effective, our ability to develop and successfully commercialize products may be adversely affected.”
Intellectual property relating to genetic engineering
In January 2019, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with Inscripta, Inc. Under the license agreement, we obtained a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to a patent portfolio covering the composition, production and use of CRISPR-MAD7, a novel gene-editing CRISPR endonuclease from the Eubacterium rectale genome. The intellectual property includes two issued U.S. patents and any pending applications claiming priority therefrom. Our license covers the making and using of CRISPR-MAD7 for editing iPSCs, making master engineered iPSC lines and using master engineered iPSC lines to manufacture human therapeutic products. These issued patents and any patents that may issue from these pending patent applications will expire in 2037, without giving effect to any patent term adjustment or extension.
Given that the rights granted to us under these patents are non-exclusive, third parties may obtain licenses to these patents and related technology to compete with us. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks related to commercialization of our product candidates—We face significant competition, and if our competitors develop product candidates more rapidly than we do or their product candidates are more effective, our ability to develop and successfully commercialize products may be adversely affected.”
Intellectual property relating to the differentiation of hematopoietic cells
We have licensed from FCDI a portfolio of six patent families regarding methods of differentiating iPSC cells including issued patents and pending patent applications broadly applicable to the differentiation of iPSC cells, the last of which is currently expected to expire in 2036. Our license is exclusive to exploit cancer 

62



immunotherapeutic products consisting of cells that are or are modifications of NK cells, T cells, dendritic cells and macrophages derived from human iPSCs. This portfolio covers various aspects of the generation of hematopoietic precursor and immune effector cells from iPSCs and, as of May 31, 2021, includes five issued U.S. patents claiming methods for the differentiation of human iPSCs to hematopoietic precursor cells and further differentiation into immune effector cells. Specifically, the portfolio includes patents with claims for producing hematopoietic precursor cells from iPSCs using a multi-step process involving certain defined media. These issued patents and any patents that may issue from these pending patent applications will expire on dates ranging from 2030 to 2036, without giving effect to any patent term adjustment or extension.
Intellectual property relating to engineered iPSCs and derivative cells
Currently, we own ten pending utility patent applications and eight pending provisional patent applications covering our engineered iPSC cells, cell differentiation technology, compositions of engineered cellular immunotherapies, and gene transfer vectors and methods of engineering iPSC cells. The portfolio includes composition of matter claims covering our CNTY-101, CNTY-102 and CNTY-107 products, as well as other iPSC-derived engineered CAR cells comprising certain transgene insertions and deletions, including our proprietary Allo-Evasion™ technology. One of our provisional patent applications includes claims directed to a universal CAR cell platform. We have also filed patent applications relating to our T-cell platform related to compositions and methods for generating alpha-beta and gamma delta T cells from iPSCs. We have also filed patent applications related to a novel safety switch. Any U.S. patents that may issue from such pending provisional patent applications would expire in from 2040-2042, without giving effect to any patent term adjustment or extension.
Intellectual property relating to engineered T cells
We have exclusively sublicensed from iCELL two families of patents owned by the University of Tokyo relating to immune function reconstruction method using multipotent stem cells and method for producing antigen-specific T cells. The portfolio includes two issued U.S. patents claiming methods for the production of T cells having antigen specificity from iPSC cells derived from human T cells where the T cells differentiated from the iPSC cells retain the antigen specificity of the human T cell from which it was derived. These issued patents will expire in 2031, without giving effect to any patent term adjustment or extension.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have made substantial investments in recent years into the rapid development of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of a range of pathologies, including infectious diseases and cancers, making this a highly competitive market.
We face substantial competition from multiple sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Our competitors compete with us on the level of the technologies employed, or on the level of development of product candidates. In addition, many small biotechnology companies have formed collaborations with large, established companies to (i) obtain support for their research, development and commercialization of products or (ii) combine several treatment approaches to develop longer lasting or more efficacious treatments that may potentially directly compete with our current or future product candidates. We anticipate that we will continue to face increasing competition as new therapies and combinations thereof, technologies, and data emerge within the field of immunotherapy and, furthermore, within the treatment of infectious diseases and cancers. In addition to the current standard of care treatments for patients with infectious diseases or cancers, numerous commercial and academic preclinical studies and clinical trials are being undertaken by a large number of parties to assess novel technologies and product candidates in the field of immunotherapy. Results from these studies and trials have fueled increasing levels of interest in the field of immunotherapy.

63



Large pharmaceutical companies that have commercialized or are developing immunotherapies to treat cancer include AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, and Roche/Genentech.
Companies that compete with us directly on the level of the development of product candidates targeting B-cell lymphomas include Gilead Sciences, Novartis and Bristol-Myers Squibb, among others. Companies developing Nectin-4 targeted agents include Seagen, Astellas and Bicycle Therapeutics. 
On the technology level, other emerging biopharmaceutical companies which can potentially develop competing cell therapy candidates to treat cancer include Editas Medicine, Inc., Fate Therapeutics, Allogene Therapeutics, CRIPSR Therapeutics, Caribou Biosciences, Cytovia Therapeutics, Shoreline Biosciences, Sana Biotechnology and Nkarta Therapeutics.
Many of our competitors, either alone or in combination with their respective strategic partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, the regulatory approval process, and marketing than we do. Mergers and acquisition activity in the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology sector is likely to result in greater resource concentration among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through sizeable collaborative arrangements with established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retain qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if one or more of our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, better tolerated, or of greater convenience or economic benefit than our proposed product offering. Our competitors also may be in a position to obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly, resulting in a stronger or dominant market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be product safety, efficacy, convenience and treatment cost.
Government regulation
In the United States, biologic products are licensed by FDA for marketing under the Public Health Service Act, referred to as the PHS Act, and regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA. Both the FDCA and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, purity, potency, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, marketing, sales, import, export, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biologic products. FDA clearance must be obtained before clinical testing of biologic products. FDA licensure also must be obtained before marketing of biologic products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
United States development process
The process required by the FDA before a biologic product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or cGLP, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation of clinical trial material in accordance with cGMP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

64




● | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCP, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety, purity, potency, and efficacy, of the proposed biologic product for its intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, potency, and efficacy from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection prior to BLA approval of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA Advisory Committee meeting to elicit expert input on critical issues and including a vote by external committee members;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA, and payment of associated user fees, when applicable; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some nonclinical testing typically continues after the IND is submitted. An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational product to humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA requests certain changes to a protocol before the trial can begin, or the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
Clinical trials may involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the 

65



study sponsor’s control. Clinical trials involving some products for certain diseases, including some rare diseases, may begin with testing in patients with the disease. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the cGCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects or his or her legal representative provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1. The biologic product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for rare and severe diseases, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. The biologic product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. In biologics for rare diseases where patient populations are small and there is an urgent need for treatment, Phase 3 trials might not be required if an adequate risk/benefit can be demonstrated from the Phase 2 trial.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life- threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

66



Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biologics, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
There are also various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with the research. In each of these areas, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals.
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its clinicaltrials.gov website. Sponsors or distributors of investigational products for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious diseases or conditions must also have a publicly available policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access requests.
United States review and approval processes
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, or PDUFA, each BLA may be accompanied by a significant user fee. Under federal law, the submission of most applications is subject to an application user fee. The sponsor of an approved application is also subject to an annual program fee. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The application also needs to be published and submitted in an electronic format that can be processed through the FDA’s electronic systems. If the electronic submission is not compatible with FDA’s systems, the BLA can be refused for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA 

67



also will determine whether a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and cGCP requirements. To assure cGMP and cGCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor interprets the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials.
Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. As a condition for approval, the FDA may also require additional nonclinical testing as a Phase 4 commitment.
One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review standard BLAs in ten months from filing and priority BLAs in six months from filing, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
United States post-approval requirements
Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation.
Following approval, the manufacturing facilities are subject to biennial inspections by the FDA’s and such inspections may result in an issuance of FDA Form 483 deficiency observations, untitled letter, or a warning letter, which can lead to plant shutdown and other more serious penalties and fines. Prior to the institution of 

68



any manufacturing changes, a determination needs to be made whether FDA approval is required in advance. If not done in accordance with FDA expectations, the FDA may restrict supply and may take further action. Annual product reports are required to be submitted annually. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse events, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements.
After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA may conduct laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. Systems need to be put in place to record and evaluate adverse events reported by health care providers and patients and to assess product complaints. An increase in severity or new adverse events can result in labeling changes or product recall. Defects in manufacturing of commercial products can result in product recalls.
We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to- consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or inpatient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval or license revocation, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect.
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products, and those supplying products, ingredients, and components of them, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Orphan drug designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation, or ODD, to a biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. ODD must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its 

69



potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. ODD does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has ODD receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as not being able to supply the product for patients or showing clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity.
Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
Expedited review and approval programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of biological products that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new biological products to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a biological product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review.
The FDA may give priority review designation to biological products that treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation may also be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. In addition, biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the biological product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a biological product receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, the FDA is permitted to require, as appropriate, that a post-approval confirmatory study or studies be underway prior to approval or within a specified time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. Sponsors are also required to send updates to the FDA every 180 days on the status of such studies, including progress toward enrollment targets, and the FDA must promptly post this information publicly. FDORA also gives the FDA increased authority to withdraw approval of a drug or biologic granted accelerated approval on an expedited basis if the sponsor fails to conduct such studies in a timely manner, send the necessary updates to the FDA, or if such post-approval studies fail to verify the drug’s predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA generally requires, 

70



unless otherwise informed by the agency, pre-approval of promotional materials for a product approved under the accelerated approval pathway, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Moreover, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biological product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biological product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drug and biological products designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decides that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast-track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation, do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act 
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or PPACA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “biosimilar” or “interchangeable” with an FDA-licensed reference biological product via an approved BLA. Biosimilarity to an approved reference product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity is demonstrated in steps beginning with rigorous analytical studies or “fingerprinting,” in vitro studies, in vivo animal studies, and generally at least one clinical study, absent a waiver from the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The biosimilarity exercise tests the hypothesis that the investigational product and the reference product are the same. If at any point in the stepwise biosimilarity process a significant difference is observed, then the products are not biosimilar, and the development of a stand-alone BLA is necessary. In order to meet the higher hurdle of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being evaluated by the FDA. Under the BPCIA, a reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product.
Regulation outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical studies, commercial sales, and distribution of our products. Most countries outside of the United States require that CTAs be submitted to and approved by the local regulatory authority for each clinical study. In the European Union, for example, an application must be submitted to the national competent authority and an independent ethics committee in each country in which we intend to conduct clinical trials, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Under the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022, a single application is now made through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS, for clinical trial authorization in up to 30 EU/EEA countries at the same time and with a single set of documentation.

71



The assessment of applications for clinical trials is divided into two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all European Union Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Concerned Member States) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the Concerned Member State, however overall related timelines are defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. The new Clinical Trials Regulation also provides for simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors.
In addition, whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside the United States before we can market the product in those countries. The approval process and requirements vary from country to country, so the number and type of nonclinical, clinical, and manufacturing studies needed may differ, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
To obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates under the European Union regulatory system, we are required to submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to be assessed in the centralized procedure. The centralized procedure allows applicants to obtain a marketing authorization, or MA, that is valid throughout the European Union, and the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), or EEA. It is compulsory for medicinal products manufactured using biotechnological processes, for orphan medicinal products, for advanced therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and for human products containing a new active substance which are not authorized in the European Union and which are intended for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases or diabetes. The centralized procedure is optional for any other products containing new active substances not authorized in the European Union or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which a centralized authorization is in the interests of patients at European Union level. When a company wishes to place on the market a medicinal product that is eligible for the centralized procedure, it sends an application directly to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, to be assessed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. The CHMP is responsible for conducting the assessment of whether a medicine meets the required quality, safety and efficacy requirements, and whether the product has a positive risk/benefit profile. The procedure results in a European Commission decision, which is valid in all European Union Member States. The centralized procedure is as follows: full copies of the MA are sent to a rapporteur and a co-rapporteur designated by the competent EMA scientific committee. They coordinate the EMA’s scientific assessment of the medicinal product and prepare draft reports. Once the draft reports are prepared (other experts might be called upon for this purpose), they are sent to the CHMP, whose comments or objections are communicated to the applicant. The rapporteur is therefore the privileged interlocutor of the applicant and continues to play this role, even after the MA has been granted.
The rapporteur and co-rapporteur then assess the applicant’s replies, submit them for discussion to the CHMP and, taking into account the conclusions of this debate, prepare a final assessment report. Once the evaluation is completed, the CHMP gives a favorable or unfavorable opinion as to whether to grant the authorization. When the opinion is favorable, it shall include the draft summary of product characteristics, or SmPC, the package leaflet and the labeling. The time limit for the evaluation procedure is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP).The EMA then has fifteen days to forward its opinion to the European Commission, which will make a binding decision on the grant of an MA within 67 days of the receipt of the CHMP opinion. 
There are two other procedures in the European Union for the grant of an MA in multiple European Union Member States. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or Concerned, Member States of an assessment of an application performed by one Member State, known as the Reference 

72



Member State. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials including a draft SmPC, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the Reference Member State and Concerned Member States. The Reference Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the Reference Member State’s assessment report, each Concerned Member State must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to the public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all Member States.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition that affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union. In addition, orphan designation can be granted if the product is intended for a life threatening, seriously debilitating, or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and where, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the product in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in its development. Orphan drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the European Union of diagnosing, preventing, or treating the applicable orphan condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients affected by such condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000.
Orphan designation provides opportunities for fee reductions, protocol assistance and access to the centralized procedure before and during the first year after a marketing authorization. Fee reductions are not limited to the first year after a marketing authorization for small and medium enterprises. In addition, if a product that has an orphan designation subsequently receives a centralized MA for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan market exclusivity, which means the EMA may not approve any other application to market a similar medicinal product for the same indication for a period of ten years. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Competitors may receive marketing approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Additionally, an MA may be granted to a similar medicinal product for the same indication at any time if:
•the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar to the authorized orphan product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; 
•the MA holder of the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or 
•the MA holder of the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
A pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, in the European Union is aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained to support the authorization of a medicine for children, through studies in children. All applications for MAs for new medicines have to include the results of studies as described in an agreed PIP, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver. This requirement also applies when a marketing- authorization holder wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form, or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized and covered by intellectual property rights. Several rewards and incentives for the development of pediatric medicines for children are available in the European Union Medicines authorized across the European Union with the results of studies from a PIP included in the product information are eligible for an extension of their supplementary protection certificate, or SPC, by six months(provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product, or at any point up to 2 years before the SPC expires). This is the case even when the studies’ 

73



results are negative. For orphan medicinal products, the incentive is an additional two years of market exclusivity.
Scientific advice and protocol assistance at the EMA are free of charge for questions relating to the development of pediatric medicines. Medicines developed specifically for children that are already authorized but are not protected by a patent or supplementary protection certificate are eligible for a pediatric-use MA, or PUMA. If a PUMA is granted, the product will benefit from ten years of market protection as an incentive.
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative, The PRIority Medicines, or PRIME, scheme, to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIME scheme is intended to encourage development of products in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted.
Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the CHMP is appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s committee level. An initial meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
The aforementioned European Union rules are generally applicable in the EEA. 
The United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020, referred to as Brexit, and the United Kingdom and the European Union have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not provide for wholesale mutual recognition of United Kingdom and European Union pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented European Union legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the European Union regulatory framework continues to apply in Northern Ireland). Except in respect of the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, the regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore largely aligns with current European Union medicines regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge more significantly in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the European Union and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of United Kingdom and European Union pharmaceutical legislation. However, notwithstanding that there is no wholesale recognition of European Union pharmaceutical legislation under the TCA, under the new framework mentioned below which will be put in place by the MHRA from January 1, 2024, the MHRA has stated that it will take into account decisions on the approval of MAs from the EMA (and certain other regulators) when considering an application for a Great Britain MA. 
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the United Kingdom’s medicines regulator, has introduced changes to national licensing procedures, including procedures to prioritize access to new medicines that will benefit patients, an accelerated assessment procedure and new routes of evaluation for novel products and biotechnological products. All existing European Union MAs for centrally authorized products were automatically converted (grandfathered) into United Kingdom MAs free-of-charge on January 1, 2021. For a period of three years from January 1, 2021, the MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new MA in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain MA. A separate application will, however, still be required. On January 24, 2023, the MHRA announced that a new international recognition framework will be put in place from January 1, 2024, which will have regard to decisions on the approval of MAs made by the EMA and certain other regulators when determining an application for a new Great Britain MA.

There is now no pre-MA orphan designation in Great Britain. Instead, the MHRA reviews applications for orphan designation in parallel to the corresponding MAA. The criteria are essentially the same, but have been tailored for the Great Britain market, i.e., the prevalence of the condition in Great Britain (rather than the European Union) must not be more than five in 10,000. Should an orphan designation be granted, the period or market exclusivity will be set from the date of first approval of the product in Great Britain or the European Union, wherever is earliest.
Healthcare laws and regulations
Sales of our product candidate, if approved, or any other future product candidate will be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we might conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the following:

● | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs and biologics, that are false or fraudulent;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors or making any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and their implementing regulations, impose obligations on certain types of individuals and entities regarding the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified nurse-midwives, and physician assistants, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA prohibits United States businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical 

75



companies to comply with the federal government’s and/or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, state laws that require drug and biologics manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
Healthcare Reform
The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government- paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs and biologics. In recent years, the United States Congress, or Congress, has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs and biologics administered by physicians. CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs and biologics. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum Medicaid rebate for both branded and generic drugs and biologics, expanded the 340B program, and revised the definition of average manufacturer price, or AMP, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also extended Medicaid drug rebates, previously due only on fee-for- service Medicaid utilization, to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those drugs. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. Subsequent litigation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2030. However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, the 2% Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the suspension, a 1% payment reduction began April 1, 2022, and remained through 

76



June 30, 2022. The 2% payment reduction resumed on July 1, 2022. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Further legislative and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry.
The Affordable Care Act has been subject to challenges in the courts. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the Texas District Court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the law as they had not alleged personal injury traceable to the allegedly unlawful conduct. As a result, the Supreme Court did not rule on the constitutionality of the ACA or any of its provisions.
The Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs and biologics to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. Furthermore, the law requires manufacturers to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the “donut hole.” The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,” by increasing from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D.
The Affordable Care Act also expanded the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The Affordable Care Act expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities: certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the Affordable Care Act. Because the 340B ceiling price is determined based on the average manufacturer price, or AMP, and Medicaid drug rebate data, revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition could cause the required 340B discounts to increase. Payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives as well. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

77



We expect that additional federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.
Human capital resources 
As of March 2, 2023, we had 163 full-time employees and 21 part-time employees. Of our 184 full and part-time employees, 151 are engaged in research and development activities. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards. We regularly evaluate our compensation programs with an independent compensation consultant and utilize industry benchmarking in an effort to ensure competitiveness compared to similar biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies with which we compete for talent, as well as fair and equitable treatment across our workforce with respect to gender, race, and other personal characteristics.
We are an equal opportunity employer and we maintain policies that prohibit unlawful discrimination based on race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, national origin/ancestry, age, disability, marital and veteran status. Our employees are not part of any collective bargaining agreements and we believe that we have good relations with our employees.
Facilities
Our principal executive offices are located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pursuant to a short-term lease. We operate in three laboratory spaces in Philadelphia pursuant to leases that expire in December 2030, October 2031 and February 2034. Additionally, we lease office and laboratory space in Seattle, Washington pursuant to leases expiring in September 2030, respectively and laboratory and office space in Hamilton, Ontario, pursuant to a lease that expires in October 2025. We have finished construction and the operational fit out of a 53,000 square foot cell therapy manufacturing facility on a tract of land in Branchburg, New Jersey pursuant to a lease expiring in February 2037. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our ongoing needs, and that, if we require additional space, we will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.
