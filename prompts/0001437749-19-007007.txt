You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of terms such as “believes,” “contemplates,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “would,” or “anticipates,” other similar phrases, or the negatives of these terms. We have based the forward-looking statements relating to our operations on our current expectations, estimates and projections about us and the markets we serve. We caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the discussion in Part I, the information set forth under Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and with the discussion of the business included in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We have based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following:

● | Closing the proposed strategic transaction discussed in this Report; and

Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
MedAmerica is a real estate management company with limited operations. During 2018, up to the time we were introduced to the commercial real estate company described below, we were focused on seeking to acquire medical office buildings. None of our discussions concluded in any acquisitions.
 
As part of our search, we were introduced to the sponsor of multiple commercial real estate properties located in the United States in late 2018. After that introduction and continuing to date, we have been engaged in negotiations which, if consummated, would result in us executing merger agreements and consummating a strategic transaction (the “Transaction”) with MedAmerica becoming the owner of between 12 and 17 retail shopping centers, the sponsor of such properties appointing five of seven members of our board of directors, and the sponsor and its investors owning a substantial majority of our common stock and the sponsor and its investors ending up as our principal shareholders. We have not yet signed a binding agreement with respect to the Transaction and any such binding agreement will be subject to a number of closing conditions, including obtaining certain financing. There can be no assurance that the Transaction will be consummated.
 
Our History
 
The Company was originally organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1985, under the name VMS Hotel Investment Trust, for the purpose of investing in mortgage loans. The Company was subsequently reorganized as a Delaware corporation in 1987 and changed its name to B.H.I.T. Inc. In 2010, the Company changed its name from B.H.I.T. Inc. to Banyan Rail Services Inc. From 2009 to 2012, the Company experienced severe losses from an operating subsidiary in the rail services sector. In 2016, after exploring various industries and researching numerous companies, the board of directors elected to pursue investing in commercial real estate.  In 2017 the Company changed its name to MedAmerica Properties Inc.  
The Transaction
 
We have been negotiating with the sponsor of several limited liability companies, each of which owns a separate shopping center located in the United States. We have reached an agreement in principal with regard to the form of merger agreement and the proposed capitalization of the combined company. The real estate mortgages for the other five shopping centers are held by entities which issued commercial mortgages-backed securities for which the approval process is lengthier or otherwise need more time to close than the shopping centers we expect to acquire at the initial closing. Accordingly, at the initial closing the Company expects to acquire 12 shopping centers at which time the current investors in the assets will own approximately 89.06% of the Company and our shareholders will own the remaining 10.94%.  Assuming we sign the merger agreements and ultimately close the Transaction, the Company will initially own 12 shopping centers and will subsequently acquire an additional five shopping centers, subject to lender approval and other closing conditions. Each shopping center has its own indebtedness secured by the particular center. Assuming we close the Transaction and acquire all of the shopping centers, we will issue common stock to the sponsor and the current investors in the assets who collectively will own approximately 92.76% of our common stock on a fully diluted basis with our current shareholders owning approximately 7.24%.
 
Closing is subject to a number of contingencies including approval by the required percentage of partners of each property-owning entity, obtaining satisfactory resolution of the proposed accounting treatment, execution of definitive merger agreements (the terms of which have been agreed upon), our board of director’s receipt of a fairness opinion, lender approvals, obtaining $47 million of financing to refinance existing indebtedness and to provide growth capital and other customary closing conditions.
 
It is currently estimated that the Transaction would be expected to be consummated late in the second quarter of 2019, but there can be no assurance that there will not be delays. We cannot assure you that we will sign the merger agreements or close the Transaction. If we do not close the Transaction, our board of directors will have to reexamine its plans with regard to acquiring real estate properties. See Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
