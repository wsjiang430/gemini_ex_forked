Segments Overview
In the fourth quarter of 2018, in connection with our efforts to improve operational focus and transparency, drive overhead accountability into segment operating results, and increase strategic agility across the value chain from our upstream business' core strength in manufacturing and technology and our downstream business' core strength in offering complete solutions in residential and commercial markets, we reorganized our segment reporting to an upstream and downstream structure. Previously, we operated under three end-customer segments comprised of our (i) Residential Segment, (ii) Commercial Segment, and (iii) Power Plant Segment. Historically, the Residential Segment referred to sales of solar energy solutions to residential end-customers, the Commercial Segment referred to sales of energy solutions to commercial and public entity end-customers, and the Power Plant Segment referred to our large-scale solar products and systems and component sales.
 5

Under the new segmentation, the SunPower Energy Services Segment ("SunPower Energy Services" or "Downstream") refers to sales of solar energy solutions in the North America region previously included in the legacy Residential Segment and Commercial Segment (collectively previously referred to as "Distributed Generation" or "DG") including direct sales of turn-key engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") services, sales to our third-party dealer network, sales of energy under power purchase agreements ("PPAs"), storage solutions, cash sales and long-term leases directly to end customers, and sales to resellers. SunPower Energy Services Segment also includes sales of our global Operations and Maintenance ("O&M") services. The SunPower Technologies Segment ("SunPower Technologies" or "Upstream") refers to our technology development, worldwide solar panel manufacturing operations, equipment supply to resellers, commercial and residential end-customers outside of North America ("International DG"), and worldwide power plant project development and project sales. Upon reorganization, some support functions and responsibilities have been shifted to each segment, including financial planning and analysis, legal, treasury, tax and accounting support and services, among others.
The reorganization provides our management with a comprehensive financial overview of our key businesses. The application of this structure permits us to align our strategic business initiatives and corporate goals in a manner that best focuses our businesses and support operations for success.
Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), reviews our business, manages resource allocations and measures performance of our activities based on financial information for the SunPower Energy Services Segment and SunPower Technologies Segment.
Reclassifications of prior period segment information have been made to conform to the current period presentation. These changes do not affect our previously reported Consolidated Financial Statements.
SunPower Energy Services
North America Residential 
Residential Systems 
We offer a complete set of residential solutions that deliver value to homeowners and our dealer partners. We have developed the capability to deliver AC panels with factory-integrated microinverters. The AC system architecture, as compared with DC systems, facilitates direct panel installation, eliminating the need to mount or assemble additional components on the roof or the side of a building, driving down system costs, improving overall system reliability, and providing improved, cleaner design aesthetics. As part of our complete solution approach, we offer our Equinox residential market product, a fully-integrated solar platform utilizing Maxeon cells, AC microinverter, and EnergyLink monitoring hardware to combine solar power production and energy management, allowing residential installers to quickly and easily complete their system installations and to ensure always-on connectivity so homeowners can easily access their data anytime, anywhere. The Equinox platform is also sold with our EnergyLink software analytics, which provides our customers with detailed information about their energy consumption and production, enabling them to further reduce their energy costs.
Concurrent with the sale of certain assets and intellectual property related to the production of microinverters to Enphase on August 9, 2018, we entered into a Master Supply Agreement (the “MSA”) pursuant to which, with certain exceptions, we have agreed to exclusively procure module-level power electronics (“MLPE”) and alternating current (“AC”) cables from Enphase to meet all of our needs for MLPE and AC cables for the manufacture and distribution of AC modules and discrete MLPE system solutions for the U.S. residential market, including our current Equinox solution and any AC module-based successor products. We have also agreed not to pair any third-party MLPE or AC cables with any of our modules for use in the grid-tied U.S. residential market where an Enphase MLPE is qualified and certified for such module. The initial term of the MSA is through December 31, 2023, and the MSA term will automatically be extended for successive two-year periods unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal.
We offer the SunPower InvisiMount residential mounting system in our product portfolio. The InvisiMount system is designed specifically for use with our panels and reduces installation time through pre-assembled parts and integrated grounding. The InvisiMount system is well-suited for residential sloped roof applications and provides design flexibility and enhanced aesthetics by delivering a unique, "floating" appearance.

Sales Channels, Residential Leasing Program, and other Financing Options
We sell our residential solar energy solutions to end customers through a variety of means, including cash sales directly to end customers, sales to resellers, including our third-party dealer network, and sales of our operations and maintenance (“O&M”) services. 
We offer financing programs that are designed to offer customers a variety of options to obtain high efficiency solar products and systems, including loans arranged through our third-party lending partners, in some cases for no money down, or by leasing high efficiency solar systems at competitive energy rates. Since its launch in 2011, our residential lease program, in partnership with third-party investors, provides U.S. customers SunPower systems under 20-year lease agreements that include system maintenance and warranty coverage, including warranties on system performance. SunPower residential lease customers have the option to purchase their leased solar systems upon the sale or transfer of their home. These financing options enhance our ability to provide individually-tailored solar solutions to a broad range of residential customers. 
As part of our strategic goals to de-lever our balance sheet and simplify our financial statements, we announced during the fourth quarter of 2017 our decision to monetize our interest in more than 400 MW of residential lease assets that historically have been consolidated in our balance sheets. On November 5, 2018, we sold a portion of our interest in certain entities that have historically held the assets and liabilities comprising our residential lease business to an affiliate of Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, Inc. 
For additional information, refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 4. Business Combination and Divestitures, Note 7. Leasing, Note 11. Equity Investments, and Note 12. Debt and Credit Sources."
Historically, we had the ability to sell portfolios of residential system leases to 8point3 Energy Partners LP ("8point3 Energy Partners"), a joint Yieldco vehicle formed by us and First Solar, Inc. ("First Solar") in which we had an ownership stake. In fiscal 2017, following a review of our strategic alternatives, we decided to explore a divestiture jointly with First Solar. On February 5, 2018, 8point3 Energy Partners entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “8point3 Merger Agreement”) with CD Clean Energy and Infrastructure V JV, LLC, an equity fund managed by Capital Dynamics, Inc. and certain other co-investors (collectively, “Capital Dynamics” and the transaction, the "Divestiture Transaction"), and we entered into a Support Agreement which obligated us to support the Divestiture Transaction. On June 19, 2018, we completed the sale of our equity interest in 8point3 Energy Partners. As a result of this transaction, we received, after the payment of fees and expenses, merger proceeds of approximately $359.9 million in cash and no longer directly or indirectly own any equity interests in 8point3 Energy Partners. 
For additional information on transactions with, and the divestiture of our interest in 8point3 Energy Partners, refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 11. Equity Investments."
North America Commercial 
Commercial Roof, Carport, and Ground Mounted Systems
As part of our complete solution product approach, we offer our Helix commercial market product. The Helix system is a pre-engineered, modular solution that combines our industry-leading solar module technology with integrated plug-and-play power stations, cable management systems, and mounting hardware that is built to last and fast to install, enabling customers to scale their solar programs quickly with minimal business disruption. The Helix platform is standardized across rooftop, carport, and ground installations and designed to lower system cost while improving performance. The Helix platform is also bundled with our Smart Energy software analytics, which provides our customers with information about their energy consumption and production, enabling them to further reduce their energy costs. 
We also offer a variety of commercial solutions designed to address a wide range of site requirements for commercial rooftop, parking lot, and open space applications, including a portfolio of solutions utilizing framed panels and a variety of internally or externally developed mounting methods for flat roof and high tilt roof applications. Our commercial flat rooftop systems are designed to be lightweight and to interlock, enhancing wind resistance and providing for secure, rapid installations.
We offer parking lot structures designed specifically for SunPower panels, balance of system components, and inverters and in fiscal 2015 expanded our capability to design and install innovative solar structures and systems for carport applications. These systems are typically custom design-build projects that utilize standard templates and design best practices to create a 
 8

solution tailored to unique site conditions. SunPower's highest efficiency panels are especially well suited to stand-alone structures, such as those found in parking lot applications, because our systems require less steel and other materials per unit of power or energy produced as compared with our competitors.
Sales Channels and Financing Options
We sell our commercial solar energy solutions to commercial and public entity end customers through a variety of means, including direct sales of turn-key engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") services, selling energy to customers under power purchase agreements ("PPAs"), sales to our third-party dealer network and sales of our O&M services. 
Operations & Maintenance
Our solar power systems are designed to generate electricity over a system life typically exceeding 25 years. We offer our customers various levels of post-installation O&M services with the objective of optimizing our customers' electrical energy production over the life of the system. The terms and conditions of post-installation O&M services may provide for remote monitoring of system production and performance, including providing performance reports, preventative maintenance, including solar module cleanings, corrective maintenance, and rapid-response outage restoration, including repair or replacement of all system components covered under warranty or major maintenance agreements. 
We incorporate leading information technology platforms to facilitate the management of our solar power systems operating globally. Real-time flow of data from our customers' sites is aggregated centrally where an engine applies advanced solar specific algorithms to detect and report potential performance issues. Our work management system routes any anomalies to the appropriate responders to help ensure timely resolution. Our performance model, PVSim, was developed over the last 20 years and has been audited by independent engineers. Solar panel performance coefficients are established through independent third-party testing. The SunPower Monitoring System also provides customers real-time performance status of their solar power system, with access to historical or daily system performance data through our customer website (www.sunpowermonitor.com). The SunPower Monitoring System is available through applications on Apple® and Android™ devices. Some customers choose to install "digital signs" or kiosks to display system performance information from the lobby of their facility. We believe these displays enhance our brand and educate the public and prospective customers about solar power.
We typically provide a system output performance warranty, separate from our standard solar panel product warranty, to customers that have subscribed to our post-installation O&M services. In connection with system output performance warranties, we agree to pay liquidated damages in the event the system does not perform to the stated specifications, with certain exclusions. The warranty excludes system output shortfalls attributable to force majeure events, customer curtailment, irregular weather, and other similar factors. In the event that the system output falls below the warrantied performance level during the applicable warranty period, and provided that the shortfall is not caused by a factor that is excluded from the performance warranty, the warranty provides that SunPower will pay the customer an amount based on the value of the shortfall of energy produced relative to the applicable warrantied performance level. For leased systems, we provide a system output performance warranty with similar terms and conditions as that for non-leased systems.
We calculate our expectation of system output performance based on a particular system’s design specifications, including the type of panels used, the type of inverters used, site irradiation measures derived from historical weather data, our historical experience as a manufacturer, EPC services provider, and project developer as well as other unique design considerations such as system shading. The warrantied system output performance level varies by system depending on the characteristics of the system and the negotiated agreement with the customer, and the level declines over time to account for the expected degradation of the system. Actual system output is typically measured annually for purposes of determining whether warrantied performance levels have been met.
Our primary remedy for the system output performance warranty is our ongoing O&M services which enable us to quickly identify and remediate potential issues before they have a significant impact on system performance. We also have remedies in the form of our standard product warranties and third-party original equipment manufacturer warranties that cover certain components, such as inverters, to prevent potential losses under our system output performance warranties or to minimize further losses.

SunPower Energy Services Technology
Balance of System Components
"Balance of system components" are components of a solar power system other than the solar panels, and include mounting structures, charge controllers, grid interconnection equipment, and other devices, depending on the specific requirements of a particular system and project. 
Inverters
Every solar power system needs an inverter to transform the direct current electricity collected from the solar panels into utility-grade AC power that is ready for use. We sell inverters manufactured by third parties, some of which are SunPower-branded. We also have integrated microinverter technology that converts DC generated by a single solar photovoltaic panel into AC directly on the panel. Subsequent to the sale of our microinverter business in August 2018, we exclusively procure microinverters for the manufacture and distribution of AC modules and discrete MLPE system solutions for the U.S. residential market from Enphase. Panels with these factory-integrated microinverters perform better in shaded applications compared to conventional string inverters and allow for optimization and monitoring at the solar panel level, enabling maximum energy production by the solar system.
Smart Energy
We see “Smart Energy” as a way to harness our world’s energy potential by connecting the most powerful and reliable solar systems on the market with an increasingly vast array of actionable data that can help our customers make smarter decisions about their energy use. Our Smart Energy initiative is designed to add layers of intelligent control to homes, buildings and grids—all personalized through easy-to-use customer interfaces. In order to enhance the portfolio of Smart Energy solutions we offer, we continue to invest in integrated technology solutions to help customers manage and optimize their CCOE measurement.
We have also negotiated several agreements with residential and commercial energy storage providers to integrate storage technology into our residential and commercial solar solutions. By combining storage with energy management, we lower our customers' cost of energy through improvements in self-consumption, rate arbitrage, demand management, and grid and market participation. We continue to work to make combined solar and storage solutions broadly commercially available. 
We continue to work with Enphase to develop next generation microinverters for use with our high efficiency solar panels in order to enhance our portfolio of Smart Energy solutions. Panels with these factory-integrated microinverters can convert direct current generated by the solar panel into alternating current, enabling optimization and monitoring at the solar panel level to ensure maximum energy production by the solar system. 
SunPower Technologies
SunPower Solutions
In 2017, SunPower established the SunPower Solutions division to deliver products and services to utility-scale photovoltaic ("PV") customers around the world. SunPower Solutions enables developers, independent power producers and EPCs to benefit from SunPower's extensive experience over the past decade developing, financing, constructing, operating and maintaining solar power plants. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, this division was assigned to our SunPower Technologies Segment. We remain focused on transitioning from project development to equipment supply through SunPower Solutions.
The SunPower Solutions division sells SunPower’s high performance P-Series, Maxeon 2 (formally known as E-Series), and Maxeon 3 (formally known as X-Series) panels to non-U.S. customers. SunPower’s family of utility power plant PV panels deliver higher efficiency and energy yield with lower degradation than competing panels.
Project Development and Financing 
Our project development business refers to sales of our large-scale solar systems, including power plant project development and project sales and EPC services for power plant construction. Our utility-scale solar power systems are typically purchased by an investor or financing company and operated as central-station solar power plants. 
 10

We are able to utilize various means to finance our utility-scale power plant development and construction projects, which include arranging tax equity financing structures and utilizing non-recourse project debt facilities in conjunction with project sales.
We believe that we possess a technological advantage as the leading manufacturer of back-contact, back-junction cells that enables our panels to produce more electricity, last longer and resist degradation more effectively. We believe that our technology allows us to deliver:

• | superior performance, including the ability to generate up to 45% more power per unit area than conventional solar cells;


• | superior aesthetics, with our uniformly black surface design that eliminates highly visible reflective grid lines and metal interconnection ribbons;


• | superior reliability, as confirmed by multiple independent reports and internal reliability data;


• | superior energy production per rated watt of power, as confirmed by multiple independent reports; and


• | solar power systems that are designed to generate electricity over a system life typically exceeding 25 years.

With industry-leading conversion efficiencies, we continuously improve our Maxeon solar cells and believe they perform better and are tested more extensively to deliver maximum return on investment when compared with the products of our competitors. 
Solar Panels
Solar panels are solar cells electrically connected together and encapsulated in a weatherproof panel. Solar cells are semiconductor devices that convert sunlight into direct current electricity. Our solar cells are designed without highly reflective metal contact grids or current collection ribbons on the front of the solar cell, which provides additional efficiency and allows our solar cells to be assembled into solar panels with a more uniform appearance. Our Maxeon 3 solar panels, made with our Maxeon Gen 3 solar cells, have demonstrated panel efficiencies exceeding 22% in high-volume production. In fiscal 2016, one of our standard production modules set a world record for aperture area efficiency as tested by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. We believe our Maxeon 3 solar panels are the highest efficiency solar panels available for the mass market, and we continue to focus on increasing cell efficiency even as we produce solar cells with over 25% efficiency in a lab setting. Because our solar cells are more efficient relative to conventional solar cells, when our solar cells are assembled into panels, the assembly cost per watt is less because more power is incorporated into a given size panel. Higher solar panel efficiency allows installers to mount a solar power system with more power within a given roof or site area and can reduce per watt installation costs. Our suite of SunPower solar panels provides customers a variety of features to fit their needs, including the SunPower Signature black design which allows the panels to blend seamlessly into the rooftop. We offer panels that can be used both with inverters that require transformers as well as with the highest performing transformer-less inverters to maximize output. Both our Maxeon 3 and Maxeon 2 panels have proven performance with low levels of degradation, as validated by third-party performance tests. Since fiscal 2016, we launched a line of solar panels under the Performance Series ("P-Series") product name. These products utilize a proprietary manufacturing process to assemble conventional silicon solar cells into panels with increased efficiency and reliability compared with conventional panels. Designed to target a new set of customers and global markets, we expect P-Series panels to contribute to the growth of both of SunPower’s business segments. 
In 2018, we continued the ramp up of our next-generation solar cells and panels with our Next Generation Technology ("NGT" or Maxeon 5), which offer efficiency of approximately 25%, roughly in line with our Maxeon 3 solar panels. When fully ramped, we expect the Maxeon 5 panels to compete with the mono-PERC solar panels, but with superior levelized cost of energy due to higher performance and durability. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we certified our first Maxeon 5 product, a 72-cell format panel rated at 450 watts, and expect delivery to initial customers in the first quarter of 2019. We eventually plan to transform all of our legacy Maxeon 2 production capacity to Maxeon 5. We are also actively pursuing a variety of partnerships and other options to enable further NGT expansion to gigawatt scale.
 11

Warranties
SunPower provides a combined 25-year standard solar panel product and power warranty for defects in materials and workmanship. The solar product warranty also warrants that Maxeon 2 and Maxeon 3 panels will provide 98% of the panel’s minimum peak power ("MPP") rating for the first year, declining due to expected degradation by no more than 0.25% per year for the following 24 years, such that the power output at the end of year 25 will be at least 92% of the panel’s MPP rating. Our P-Series panels are warranted to provide 97% of the panel’s MPP rating for the first year, declining due to expected degradation by no more than 0.6% per year for the following 24 years, such that the power output at the end of year 25 will be at least 82.6% of the panel’s MPP rating. Our warranty provides that we will repair or replace any defective solar panels during the warranty period. We also pass through long-term warranties from the original equipment manufacturers of certain system components to customers for periods ranging from five to 20 years. In addition, we generally warrant our workmanship on installed systems for periods ranging up to 25 years.
Research and Development
We engage in extensive research and development efforts to improve solar cell efficiency through the enhancement of our existing products, development of new techniques, and by reductions in manufacturing cost and complexity. Our research and development group works closely with our manufacturing facilities, our equipment suppliers and our customers to improve our solar cell design and to lower solar cell, solar panel and system product manufacturing and assembly costs. In addition, we have dedicated employees who work closely with our current and potential suppliers of crystalline silicon, a key raw material used in the manufacture of our solar cells, to develop specifications that meet our standards and ensure the high quality we require, while at the same time controlling costs. Under our Research & Collaboration Agreement with Total, our majority stockholder, we have established a joint committee to engage in long-term research and development projects with continued focus on maintaining and expanding our technology position in the crystalline silicon domain and ensuring our competitiveness. Refer to "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Research and Development."
Supplier Relationships, Manufacturing, and Panel Assembly
We purchase polysilicon, ingots, wafers, solar cells, balance of system components, and inverters from various manufacturers on both a contracted and a purchase order basis. We have contracted with some of our suppliers for multi-year supply agreements. Under such agreements, we have annual minimum purchase obligations and in certain cases prepayment obligations. Refer to "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations" for further information regarding the amount of our purchase obligations in fiscal 2019 and beyond. Under other supply agreements, we are required to make prepayments to vendors over the terms of the arrangements. As of December 30, 2018, advances to suppliers totaled $172 million. We may be unable to recover such prepayments if the credit conditions of these suppliers materially deteriorate or if we are otherwise unable to fulfill our obligations under these supply agreements. For further information regarding our future prepayment obligations, refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies—Advances to Suppliers." We currently believe our supplier relationships and various short- and long-term contracts will afford us the volume of material and services required to meet our planned output over the next several years. For more information about risks related to our supply chain, including without limitation risks relating to announced tariffs on solar cells and modules imported into the U.S., refer to "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Supply Chain."
We are working with our suppliers and partners along all steps of the value chain to reduce costs by improving manufacturing technologies and expanding economies of scale. Crystalline silicon is the principal commercial material for solar cells and is used in several forms, including single-crystalline, or monocrystalline silicon, multi-crystalline, or polycrystalline silicon, ribbon and sheet silicon, and thin-layer silicon. Our solar cell value chain starts with high purity silicon called polysilicon. Polysilicon is created by refining quartz or sand.

Polysilicon is melted and grown into crystalline ingots and sawed into wafers by business partners specializing in those processes. The wafers are processed into solar cells in our manufacturing facilities located in the Philippines and Malaysia. During fiscal 2017, we completed the construction of the solar cell manufacturing facility that we own and operate in the Philippines which has an annual capacity of 450 MW. The solar cell manufacturing facility we own and operate in Malaysia has a total rated annual capacity of over 700 MW.
We use our solar cells to manufacture our Maxeon 3 and Maxeon 2 solar panels at our solar panel assembly facilities located in Mexico and France, while we source solar cells from third parties for use in our P-Series solar panels at our solar 
 12

panel assembly facility in Mexico and in Hillsboro, Oregon starting in 2019. Our solar panel manufacturing facilities have a combined total rated annual capacity of over 1.4 GW.
We source the solar panels and balance of system components based on quality, performance, and cost considerations both internally and from third-party suppliers. We typically assemble proprietary components, while we purchase generally available components from third-party suppliers. The balance of system components, along with the EPC cost to construct the project, can comprise as much as two-thirds of the cost of a solar power system. Therefore, we focus on standardizing our products with the goal of driving down installation costs, such as with our Equinox and Helix systems.
Customers
Effective in the fourth quarter of 2018, we now operate in two segments: (i) SunPower Energy Services Segment and (ii) SunPower Technologies Segment. Our scope and scale allow us to deliver solar solutions across all segments, ranging from consumer homeowners to the largest commercial and governmental entities in the world. Our customers typically include investors, financial institutions, project developers, electric utilities, independent power producers, commercial and governmental entities, production home builders, residential owners and small commercial building owners. We leverage a combination of direct sales as well as a broad partner ecosystem to efficiently reach our global customer base.
We work with development, construction, system integration, and financing companies to deliver our solar power products and solutions to wholesale sellers, retail sellers, and retail users of electricity. In the United States, commercial and electric utility customers typically choose to purchase solar electricity under a PPA with an investor or financing company that buys the system from us. End-user customers typically pay the investors and financing companies over an extended period of time based on energy they consume from the solar power systems, rather than paying for the full capital cost of purchasing the solar power systems. Our utility-scale solar power systems are typically purchased by an investor or financing company, and operated as central-station solar power plants. In addition, our third-party dealer network and our new homes division have deployed thousands of SunPower rooftop solar power systems to residential customers. See "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Revenue" for our significant customers. 
Competition
The market for solar electric power technologies is competitive and continually evolving. In the last year, we faced increased competition, resulting in price reductions in the market and reduced margins, which may continue and could lead to loss of market share. Our solar power products and systems compete with many competitors in the solar power market, including, but not limited to:

• | SunPower Energy Services Segment: Canadian Solar Inc., Hanwha QCELLS Corporation, JA Solar Holdings Co., Kyocera Corporation, LG Corporation, Jinko Solar, NRG Energy, Inc., Panasonic Corporation, Sharp Corporation, SunRun, Inc., Tesla, Inc., Trina Solar Ltd., Vivint, Inc., LONGi Solar, REC Group, Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., and Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. Ltd., First Solar, Inc.


• | SunPower Technologies: Hanwha QCELLS Corporation, JA Solar Holdings Co., Trina Solar Ltd., Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., Ltd., Jinko Solar, First Solar Inc., Canadian SolarInc., LONGi Solar, Tongwei Co. Ltd., Array Technologies, Inc., Soltec, NEXTracker, Inc., Convert Italia, Arctech, Inc.

We also face competition from resellers that have developed related offerings that compete with our product and service offerings, or have entered into strategic relationships with other existing solar power system providers. We compete for limited government funding for research and development contracts, customer tax rebates and other programs that promote the use of solar, and other renewable forms of energy with other renewable energy providers and customers.
In addition, universities, research institutions, and other companies have brought to market alternative technologies, such as thin-film solar technology, which compete with our PV technology in certain applications. Furthermore, the solar power market in general competes with other energy providers such as electricity produced from conventional fossil fuels supplied by utilities and other sources of renewable energy such as wind, hydro, biomass, solar thermal, and emerging distributed generation technologies such as micro-turbines, sterling engines and fuel cells.
In the large-scale on-grid solar power systems market, we face direct competition from a number of companies, including those that manufacture, distribute, or install solar power systems as well as construction companies that have expanded into the renewable sector. In addition, we will occasionally compete with distributed generation equipment suppliers.
 13

We believe that the key competitive factors in the market for solar power systems include:

• | total system price;


• | LCOE evaluation;


• | CCOE evaluation;


• | power efficiency and performance;


• | aesthetic appearance of solar panels and systems;


• | speed and ease of installation through modular solutions such as our Helix system;


• | strength of distribution relationships;


• | availability of third-party financing and investments;


• | established sales channels to customers;


• | timeliness of new product introductions;


• | bankability, strength, and reputation of our company; and


• | warranty protection, quality, and customer service.

We believe that we can compete favorably with respect to each of these elements, although we may be at a disadvantage in comparison to larger companies with broader product lines, greater technical service and support capabilities, and financial resources. For more information on risks related to our competition, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors" including "Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—The increase in the global supply of solar cells and panels, and increasing competition, may cause substantial downward pressure on the prices of such products and cause us to lose sales or market share, resulting in lower revenues, earnings, and cash flows."
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, and contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights. "SunPower" and the "SunPower" logo are our registered trademarks in countries throughout the world for use with solar cells, solar panels, energy monitoring systems, inverters, and mounting systems. We also hold registered trademarks for, among others, “SunPower Equinox,” “SunPower Giving,” “SunPower Horizons,” “SunPower Energy Services,” “SunPower Technologies,” “Bottle the Sun,” “Demand Better Solar,” “EDDiE,” “EnergyLink,” “Equinox Energy Systems and Design,” “Equinox Solar Systems and Design,” “Equinox,” “Experiential Learning. Expanding Opportunities.,” “Equinox,” “Helix,” “InvisiMount,” “Light on Land,” “Maxeon,” “Oasis,” “Oasis Geo,” “Powering a Brighter Tomorrow,” “PowerLight,” “Serengeti,” “Smart Energy,” “Smarter Solar,” “Solar Showdown,” “Sol,” “Solaire,” “Solaire Generation,” “SunTile,” “SunPower Electric,” “Supo Solar,” “More Energy. For Life.,” “The Planet's Most Powerful Solar,” and “The Power of One” in certain countries. We are seeking and will continue to seek registration of the "SunPower" trademark and other trademarks in additional countries as we believe is appropriate. As of December 30, 2018, we held registrations for 26 trademarks in the United States, and had 4 trademark registration applications pending. We also held 68 trademark registrations and had 11 trademark applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We typically require our business partners to enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our solar cells, technology, or business plans. We typically enter into proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants, vendors, customers, and joint venture partners.
We own multiple patents and patent applications that cover aspects of the technology in the solar cells, mounting products, and electrical and electronic systems that we currently manufacture and market. We continue to file for and receive new patent rights on a regular basis. The lifetime of a utility patent typically extends for 20 years from the date of filing with the relevant government authority. We assess appropriate opportunities for patent protection of those aspects of our technology, designs, methodologies, and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages to us, and for licensing opportunities of new technologies relevant to our business. As of December 30, 2018, we held 464 patents in the United States, which will expire at various times through 2037, and had 246 U.S. patent applications pending. We also held 535 patents and 
 14

had 592 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. While patents are an important element of our intellectual property strategy, our business as a whole is not dependent on any one patent or any single pending patent application. We additionally rely on trade secret rights to protect our proprietary information and know-how. We employ proprietary processes and customized equipment in our manufacturing facilities. We therefore require employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements to protect them.
When appropriate, we enforce our intellectual property rights against other parties. For more information about risks related to our intellectual property, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors" including "Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We depend on our intellectual property, and we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend and could result in the loss of significant rights," "Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We rely substantially upon trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights, and, if these rights are not sufficiently protected, our ability to compete and generate revenue could suffer," and "Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We may not obtain sufficient patent protection on the technology embodied in the solar products we currently manufacture and market, which could harm our competitive position and increase our expenses."
Backlog
We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects. In our SunPower Energy Services Segment's residential and commercial and international DG markets, we often sell large volumes of solar panels, mounting systems, and other solar equipment to third parties, which are typically ordered by our third-party dealer network and customers under standard purchase orders with relatively short delivery lead-times. Additionally, we often require project financing for development and construction of our SunPower Technologies Segment's solar power plant projects, which require significant investments before the equity is later sold by us to investors. Therefore, our solar power system project backlog would exclude sales contracts signed and completed in the same quarter and contracts still conditioned upon obtaining financing. Based on these reasons, we believe backlog at any particular date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future revenue for any particular period of time.
Regulations
Public Policy Considerations
Different public policy mechanisms have been used by governments to accelerate the adoption and use of solar power. Examples of customer-focused financial mechanisms include capital cost rebates, performance-based incentives, feed-in tariffs, tax credits, and net metering. Some of these government mandates and economic incentives are scheduled to be reduced or to expire, or could be eliminated altogether. Capital cost rebates provide funds to customers based on the cost and size of a customer’s solar power system. Performance-based incentives provide funding to a customer based on the energy produced by their solar power system. Feed-in tariffs pay customers for solar power system generation based on energy produced, at a rate generally guaranteed for a period of time. Tax credits reduce a customer’s taxes at the time the taxes are due. Net metering allows customers to deliver to the electric grid any excess electricity produced by their on-site solar power systems, and to be credited for that excess electricity at or near the full retail price of electricity.
In addition to the mechanisms described above, new market development mechanisms to encourage the use of renewable energy sources continue to emerge. For example, many states in the United States have adopted renewable portfolio standards which mandate that a certain portion of electricity delivered to customers come from eligible renewable energy resources. Some states, such as California and Hawaii, have significantly expanded their renewable portfolio standards in recent years. In certain developing countries, governments are establishing initiatives to expand access to electricity, including initiatives to support off-grid rural electrification using solar power. For more information about how we avail ourselves of the benefits of public policies and the risks related to public policies, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors" including "Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—The reduction, modification or elimination of government incentives could cause our revenue to decline and harm our financial results," "Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—Existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products, which may significantly reduce demand for our products and services," and "Changes in international trade policies, tariffs, or trade disputes could significantly and adversely affect our business, revenues, margins, results of operations, and cash flows."

Environmental Regulations
We use, generate, and discharge toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous chemicals and wastes in our research and development, manufacturing, and construction activities. We are subject to a variety of foreign, U.S. federal and state, and local governmental laws and regulations related to the purchase, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials. We believe that we have all environmental permits necessary to conduct our business and expect to obtain all necessary environmental permits for future activities. We believe that we have properly handled our hazardous materials and wastes and have appropriately remediated any contamination at any of our premises. For more information about risks related to environmental regulations, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors" including "Risks Related to Our Operations—Compliance with environmental regulations can be expensive, and noncompliance with these regulations may result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages and fines."
Information concerning certain limited activities in Iran 
Information concerning TOTAL’s activities related to Iran that took place in 2018 provided in this section is disclosed according to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“U.S. Exchange Act”). TOTAL believes that these activities are not sanctionable, including for activities previously disclosed. Total S.A. and any of its subsidiaries and affiliates are collectively referred to as the Group. 
The Group’s operational activities related to Iran were stopped in 2018 following the withdrawal of the United States from the JCPOA in May 2018 and prior to the re-imposition of U.S. secondary sanctions on the oil industry as of November 5, 2018. 
Statements in this section concerning affiliates intending or expecting to continue activities described below are subject to such activities continuing to be permissible under applicable international economic sanctions regimes.
a)     Exploration & Production
Following the suspension of certain international economic sanctions against Iran on January 16, 2016, the Group commenced various business development activities in Iran. Total E&P South Pars S.A.S. (“TEPSP”) (a wholly-owned affiliate), CNPC International Ltd. (“CNPCI”) (a wholly-owned affiliate of China National Petroleum Company) and Petropars Ltd. (“Petropars”) (a wholly-owned affiliate of NIOC) signed a 20-year risked service contract in July 2017, (the “Risked Service Contract”) for the development and production of phase 11 of the South Pars gas field (“SP11”).TEPSP (50.1%) was the operator and a partner of the project alongside CNPCI (30%) and Petropars (19.9%). These companies entered into a joint operating agreement in July 2017 (the “JOA”) concerning, among other things, the governance of their obligations under the Risked Service Contract and the designation of TEPSP as the project’s operator. 
In 2018, TEPSP continued conducting petroleum operations on behalf of the above-mentioned consortium in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Risked Service Contract and the JOA. In particular, TEPSP: (i) held several meetings with the Iranian authorities, NIOC and other Iranian state owned/controlled entities; (ii) launched tenders for award of service contracts for the purposes of the SP11 project; (iii) negotiated various agreements (such as service and/or supply agreements and bank service agreements); and (iv) performed other activities under the Risked Service Contract and the JOA.
In 2018, TEPSP completed the technical studies, which were started in November 2016, in accordance with the technical services agreement (the “TSA”) between NIOC and TEPSP, acting on behalf of the consortium.
However, as a result of the withdrawal of the U.S. from the JCPOA in May 2018, TOTAL ceased all of its activities related to the SP11 project and finalized its withdrawal from the SP11 project on October 29, 2018, at which time it transferred its participating interest and operatorship of the project to CNPCI. 
The MOU entered into between TOTAL and NIOC in January 2016 to assess potential developments in Iran (including South Azadegan) was amended to include North Azadegan and to extend its duration. NIOC provided TOTAL in 2017 with technical data on the Azadegan oil field so that it could assess potential development of this field. Representatives of TOTAL held technical meetings in 2017 with representatives of NIOC and its affiliated companies and carried out a technical review of the Azadegan (South & North) oil field as well as the Iran LNG Project (a project contemplating a 10 Mt/y LNG production facility at Tombak Port on Iran’s Persian Gulf coast), the results of which were partially disclosed to NIOC and relevant affiliated companies. In addition, TOTAL signed an MOU in 2017 with an international company to evaluate jointly the Azadegan oil field opportunity with NIOC. This international company decided in February 2018 to withdraw from this technical cooperation and a MOU termination agreement was formally executed with TOTAL on May 16, 2018. Technical 
 16

studies were pursued by TOTAL until March 2018 on the Azadegan area with regular contacts with NIOC. All work and contacts with NIOC on this subject ceased at the end of March 2018.
During 2018, in connection with the activities under the aforementioned Risked Service Contract and MOUs, and to discuss other new opportunities, representatives of TOTAL attended meetings with the Iranian oil and gas ministry and several Iranian companies with ties to the government of Iran. In connection with travel to Iran in 2018 by certain employees of the Group, TOTAL made payments to Iranian authorities for visas, airport services, exit fees and similar travel-related charges. In addition, representatives of TOTAL had meetings in France with the Iranian ambassador.
Neither revenues nor profits were recognized from any of the aforementioned activities under the aforementioned Risked Service Contract and MOUs in 2018.
Maersk Oil studied two potential projects with NIOC, prior to the acquisition of Maersk Oil by TOTAL in March 2018. These studies ceased after a meeting with NIOC representatives in May 2018. 
The Tehran branch office of TEPSP, opened in 2017 for the purposes of the SP11 project, ceased all operational activities prior to November 1, 2018 and will be closed and de-registered in 2019. Since November 2018, Total Iran BV maintains a local representative office in Tehran with a few employees, solely for non-operational functions. Concerning payments to Iranian entities in 2018, Total Iran BV and Elf Petroleum Iran collectively made payments of approximately IRR 31.7 billion (approximately $300,000 (Converted using the average exchange rate for fiscal year 2018, as published by Bloomberg.) to the Iranian administration for taxes and social security contributions concerning the personnel of the aforementioned representative office and residual obligations related to various prior risked service contracts. In 2019, similar types of payments are to be made in connection with maintaining the representative office in Tehran, albeit in lower amounts. None of these payments has been or is expected to be executed in U.S. dollars. 
Furthermore, Total E&P UK Limited (“TEP UK”), a wholly-owned affiliate, holds a 1% interest in a joint venture for the Bruce field in the United Kingdom with Serica Energy (UK) Limited (“Serica”) (98%, operator) and BP Exploration Operating Company Limited (“BP”) (1%), following the completion of the sale of 42.25% of TEP UK’s interests in the Bruce field on November 30, 2018 pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement dated August 2, 2018 between TEP UK and Serica. Upon the closing of the transaction on November 30, 2018, all other prior joint venture partners also sold their interests in the Bruce field to Serica (BP sold 36% retaining a 1% interest; BHP Billiton Petroleum Great Britain Limited (“BHP”) sold their full 16% interest and Marubeni Oil & Gas (U.K.) Limited ((“Marubeni”) sold their full 3.75%).
The Bruce field joint venture is party to an agreement (the “Bruce Rhum Agreement”) governing certain transportation, processing and operation services provided to another joint venture at the Rhum field in the UK, co-owned by Serica (50%, operator) and the Iranian Oil Company UK Ltd (“IOC”), a subsidiary of NIOC (50%). Under the terms of the Bruce Rhum Agreement, the Rhum field owners pay a proportion of the operating costs of the Bruce field facilities calculated on a gas throughput basis. IOC’s share of costs incurred under the Bruce Rhum Agreement have been paid to TEP UK in 2018 by Naftiran Intertrade Company Limited (“NICO”), the trading branch of the National Iranian Oil Company (“NIOC”). NIOC is the parent company of IOC and an Iranian government owned corporation. In 2018, based upon TEP UK’s 1% interest in the Bruce field and income from the net cash flow sharing arrangement with Serica, gross revenue to TEP UK from IOC’s share of the Rhum field resulting from the Bruce Rhum Agreement was approximately £8 million. This sum was used to offset operating costs on the Bruce field and as such, generated no net profit to TEP UK. This arrangement is expected to continue in 2019. 
In 2018, TEP UK acted as agent for BHP and Marubeni, which faced difficulty securing banking arrangements allowing them to accept payments from IOC, and, thus, received payments from IOC in relation to BHP and Marubeni’s share of income from the Bruce Rhum Agreement under the terms of an agency agreement entered into in June 2018 between BHP, Marubeni and TEP UK (the “Agency Agreement”). Payments made from IOC to BHP and Marubeni in 2018 related to the periods prior to the completion of their divestment to Serica in November 2018. Total payment received on behalf of BHP and Marubeni by TEP UK under this arrangement in 2018 was approximately £7 million. This amount relates to income due to BHP and Marubeni under the Bruce Rhum Agreement for 2017 and 2018. TEP UK transferred all income received under the Agency Agreement to BHP and Marubeni and provided the service on a no profit, no loss basis. The Agency Agreement is expected to be terminated upon receipt of all payments relating to the period up to November 30, 2018.
Prior to the re-imposition of U.S. secondary sanctions on the oil industry as of November 5, 2018, TEP UK liaised directly with IOC concerning its interest in the Bruce Rhum Agreement and it received payments directly for services provided to IOC under the Bruce Rhum Agreement. In October 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”) granted a new conditional license to BP and Serica authorizing the provision of services to the Rhum field, following the reinstatement of U.S. secondary sanctions. The principal condition of the OFAC license is that the Iranian government’s 
 17

shareholding in IOC is transferred into a trust in order that Iran may not derive any benefit from the Rhum field or exercise any control while the U.S. secondary sanctions are in place. A Jersey based trust has been put in place with the trustee holding IOC’s shares in the Rhum field. IOC’s interest is now managed by a new independent management company established by the trust and referred to as the “Rhum Management Company” (“RMC”) and where necessary TEP UK liaises, and expects to continue doing so in 2019, with RMC in relation to the Bruce Rhum Agreement. 
TEP UK is also party to an agreement with Serica whereby TEP UK uses reasonable endeavors to evacuate Rhum NGL from the St Fergus Terminal (the “Rhum NGL Agreement”). TEP UK provides this service - subject to Serica having title to all of the Rhum NGL to be evacuated and Serica having a valid license from OFAC for the activity - on a cost basis, but for which TEP UK charges a monthly handling fee that generates an income of approximately £35,000 per annum relating to IOC’s 50% stake in the Rhum field. After costs, TEP UK realizes little profit from this arrangement.TEP UK expects to continue this activity in 2019.
Following the acquisition of Maersk Oil in 2018, the undeveloped Yeoman discovery is now wholly owned by the Group, under license P2158 granted to Maersk Oil North Sea UK Limited, recently renamed Total E&P North Sea UK Limited (“TEPNSUK”). Yeoman is situated adjacent to the Pardis discovery in which IOC held an interest, which it sold in October 2018. Prior to this divestment, non-legally binding technical and commercial discussions had taken place between TEPNSUK, IOC and the UK Government’s Oil and Gas Authority during the first half of 2018 regarding a potential joint development of Yeoman and Pardis but no contractual arrangements were implemented in connection with such discussions. Also prior to this divestement, other discussions had taken place between TEPNSUK and IOC on an informal basis regarding a potential farm-in to Pardis by Maersk Oil.
Lastly, TOTAL S.A. paid approximately €8,000 to Iranian authorities related to various patents (Section 560.509 of the U.S. Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations provides an authorization for certain transactions in connection with patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property protection in the United States or Iran, including payments for such services and payments to persons in Iran directly connected to intellectual property rights, and TOTAL believes that the activities related to the industrial property rights described in this point 3.1.9.2 are consistent with that authorization.) in 2018. Similar payments are expected to be made in 2019 for such patents. 
b)     Other business segments

In 2018, TOTAL S.A. paid fees of approximately €1,500 to Iranian authorities related to the maintenance and protection of trademarks and designs in Iran. Similar payments are expected to be made in 2019.
Trading & Shipping
Following the suspension of applicable EU and U.S. economic sanctions in 2016, the Group commenced the purchase of Iranian hydrocarbons through its wholly-owned affiliate TOTSA TOTAL OIL TRADING SA (“TOTSA”). In 2018, the Group continued its trading activities with Iran via TOTSA, which purchased approximately 18 Mb of Iranian crude oil for nearly €1 billion pursuant to term contracts. It is not possible to estimate the gross revenue and net profit related to these purchases because the totality of this crude oil was used to supply the Group’s refineries. In addition, in 2018, approximately 1 Mb of petroleum products were sold to entities with ties to the government of Iran. These activities generated gross revenue of nearly €43 million and a net profit of approximately €1 million. The Group ceased these activities in June 2018.
Gas, Renewables & Power
Saft Groupe S.A. (“Saft”), a wholly-owned affiliate, in 2018 sold signaling and backup battery systems for metros and railways as well as products for the utilities and oil and gas sectors to companies in Iran, including some having direct or indirect ties with the Iranian government. In 2018, this activity generated gross revenue of approximately €2.5 million and net profit of approximately €0.3 million. Saft ceased this activity in 2018. Saft also attended the Iran Oil Show in 2018, where it discussed business opportunities with Iranian customers, including those with direct or indirect ties with the Iranian government. Saft ceased this activity in 2018.
Total Eren, a company in which Total Eren Holding holds an interest of 68.76% (TOTAL S.A. owns 33.86% of Total Eren Holding), had preliminary discussions during January to March 2018 for possible investments in renewable energy projects in Iran, including meetings with ministries of the Iranian government. These discussions and meetings ceased as of March 2018 and neither revenues nor profits were recognized from this activity in 2018.
 18

Refining & Chemicals
As of May 2018, Hutchinson SA and its affiliates no longer accepted orders from Iranian companies and ceased all activities, in general, with Iran and all Iranian companies prior to August 6, 2018.
Le Joint Français, a wholly-owned affiliate of Hutchinson SA, sold vehicular O-ring seals in 2018 to Iran Khodro, a company in which the government of Iran holds a 20% interest and which is supervised by Iran’s Industrial Management Organization. This activity generated gross revenue of approximately €54,056 and net profit of approximately €8,108. Le Joint Français also sold O-ring seals in 2018 to Al Khalsan. This activity generated gross revenue of approximately €29,348 and net profit of approximately €4,402. 
Paulstra S.N.C., a wholly-owned affiliate of Hutchinson SA, obtained in 2017 an order from Iran Khodro to sell vehicular anti-vibration systems over a 5-year period. This activity did not generate any gross revenue or net profit in 2018 because Paulstra did not delivery any product to Iran Khodro. The order was terminated in 2018. Paulstra S.N.C. also sold oil seals in 2018 to Iran Khodro. This activity generated gross revenue of approximately €1,078,887 and net profit of approximately €161,833. 
Catelsa Caceres, a wholly-owned affiliate of Hutchinson Iberia, itself wholly-owned by Hutchinson SA, sold sealing products to Iran Khodro in 2018. This activity generated gross revenue of approximately €1,449 and net profit of approximately €217.
Hutchinson GMBH, a wholly-owned affiliate of Hutchinson SA, sold hoses for automotive vehicles to Iran Khodro in 2018. This activity generated gross revenue for approximately €257,400 and net profit of approximately €38,610. The last shipments from Hutchinson and its affiliates to Iran Khodro were in August 2018 and last payments were made in October 2018. 
Hanwha Total Petrochemicals (“HTC”), a joint venture in which Total Holdings UK Limited (a wholly-owned affiliate) holds a 50% interest and Hanwha General Chemicals holds a 50% interest, purchased approximately 17 Mb of condensates from NIOC for approximately KRW 1,310 billion (approximately $1.2 billion) from January to July 2018, then HTC has stopped purchasing from NIOC. These condensates are used as raw material for certain of HTC’s steam crackers. HTC also chartered fifteen tankers of condensates with National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC), a subsidiary of NIOC, for approximately KRW 24 billion (approximately $22.3 million). In November 2018, South Korea was granted a significant reduction exemption waiver (the “SRE waiver”) allowing it to import Iranian condensate from NIOC for six months. For 2019, based on the SRE waiver, HTC is reviewing the feasibility to resume purchases from NIOC.
Total Research & Technology Feluy (“TRTF”, a wholly-owned affiliate), Total Marketing Services (“TMS”, a wholly-owned affiliate), and Total Raffinage Chimie (“TRC”) paid in 2018 fees totaling approximately €1,000 to Iranian authorities related to various patents. Similar payments are expected to be made by TRTF and TRC in 2019. TMS abandoned its patent rights in Iran in 2018, thus no payments are expected by TMS in 2019.
Marketing & Services
Until December 2012, at which time it sold its entire interest, the Group held a 50% interest in the lubricants retail company Beh Tam (formerly Beh Total) along with Behran Oil (50%), a company controlled by entities with ties to the government of Iran. As part of the sale of the Group’s interest in Beh Tam, TOTAL S.A. agreed to license the trademark “Total” to Beh Tam for an initial 3-year period (renewed for an additional 3 year period) for the sale by Beh Tam of lubricants to domestic consumers in Iran. Royalty payments for 2014 were received by TOTAL S.A. during the first semester of 2018 in the amount of approximately €730,000. There remain outstanding royalty payments for 2015 through 2017 in favor of TOTAL S.A. This licensing agreement was terminated in 2018. In addition, representatives of Total Oil Asia-Pacific Pte Ltd, a wholly-owned affiliate, visited Behran Oil beginning 2018 regarding the potential purchase of 50% of the share capital of Beh Tam. Discussions on this matter ended following the announcement of the re-imposition of U.S. secondary sanctions on the oil industry.
Total Marketing Middle East FZE, a wholly-owned affiliate, sold lubricants to Beh Tam in 2018. The sale in 2018 of approximately 43 t of lubricants and special fluids generated gross revenue of approximately AED 500,000 (approximately $136,000) and net profit of approximately AED 260,000 (approximately $ 71,000) (Converted using the average exchange rate for fiscal year 2018, as published by Bloomberg). The company stopped all transactions with this customer as of August 2018.
 19

Total Marketing France (“TMF”), a company wholly-owned by TMS, provided in 2018 fuel payment cards to the Iranian embassy and delegation to UNESCO in France for use in the Group’s service stations. In 2018, these activities generated gross revenue of approximately €32,000 and net profit of approximately €5,000. The company expects to continue this activity in 2019.
TMF also sold jet fuel in 2018 to Iran Air as part of its airplane refueling activities in France. The sale of approximately 260 cubic meters of jet fuel generated gross revenue of approximately €130,000 and net profit of approximately €570. The company stopped all transactions with this customer prior to November 5, 2018.
Total Belgium, a wholly-owned affiliate, provided in 2018 fuel payment cards to the Iranian embassy in Brussels (Belgium) for use in the Group’s service stations. In 2018, these activities generated gross revenue of approximately €11,000 and net profit of approximately €4,000. The company expects to continue this activity in 2019.
Employees
As of December 30, 2018, we had approximately 6,600 full-time employees worldwide, of which 1,280 were located in the United States, 1,900 were located in the Philippines, 1,470 were located in Malaysia, and 1,950 were located in other countries. Of these employees, 4,485 were engaged in manufacturing, 1,075 in construction projects, 260 in research and development, 355 in sales and marketing, and 430 in general and administrative services. Although in certain countries we have works councils and statutory employee representation obligations, our employees are generally not represented by labor unions on an ongoing basis. We have never experienced a work stoppage, and we believe our relations with our employees to be good.
Seasonal Trends and Economic Incentives
Our business is subject to industry-specific seasonal fluctuations including changes in weather patterns and economic incentives, among others. Sales have historically reflected these seasonal trends with the largest percentage of total revenues realized during the last two quarters of our fiscal year. The construction of solar power systems or installation of solar power components and related revenue may decline during cold winter months. In the United States, many customers make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for other budgetary reasons. In addition, revenues may fluctuate due to the timing of project sales, construction schedules, and revenue recognition of certain projects, which may significantly impact the quarterly profile of our results of operations. We may also retain certain development projects on our balance sheet for longer periods of time than in preceding periods in order to optimize the economic value we receive at the time of sale in light of market conditions, which can fluctuate after we have committed to projects.
