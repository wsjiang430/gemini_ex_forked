Item 1.   Business.
Overview
We are a commercial stage medical technology company focused on designing, developing and marketing products that improve the quality of life for patients who suffer from neurohealth disorders. Our first commercial product, the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System, is a non-invasive and non-systemic office-based treatment that uses transcranial magnetic stimulation (“TMS”) to create a pulsed, MRI-strength magnetic field that induces electrical currents designed to stimulate specific areas of the brain associated with mood. The system is cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) to treat adult patients with major depressive disorder (“MDD”) that have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from at least one prior antidepressant medication in the current MDD episode. It is also cleared by the FDA as an adjunct for adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (“OCD”), and to decrease anxiety symptoms in adult patients with MDD that may exhibit comorbid anxiety symptoms (anxious depression). NeuroStar Advanced Therapy is safe, clinically effective, reproducible and precise and we believe is supported by the largest clinical data set of any competing TMS system. We believe we are the market leader in TMS therapy based on the estimated 147,400 global patients treated with over 5.3 million of our treatment sessions through December 31, 2022. We generated revenues of $65.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
MDD is a mood disorder characterized by the presence of one or both of two major diagnostic criteria: a depressed mood or loss of interest in pleasure that continues for at least two weeks. The presence of at least one of these diagnostic symptoms must be accompanied by several of the following additional symptoms: sleep disturbance, changes in appetite, sexual dysfunction, anxiety, fatigue, difficulty concentrating and suicidal thinking. MDD is a recurrent disease and follows a fluctuating course over an individual’s lifetime. It can be characterized by periods of remission and relapse.
The World Health Organization (the “WHO”) ranks MDD as the single largest contributor to global disability and a major contributor to suicide worldwide. According to a study published in the Journal of PharmacoEconomics in 2021, the economic burden of MDD was estimated to be $326.2 billion, an increase of 37.9% relative to 2010. WHO estimates indicate the proportion of the global population with depression to be 4.4% and that there are over 300 million people in the world living with depression. Based on U.S. Census Bureau data and a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, we estimate that approximately 21 million people between the ages of 22 and 70 years in the United States suffer from MDD annually, of whom an estimated 13.9 million, based on data from the Journal of the American Medical Association, are being treated by a psychiatrist. We estimate, based on data from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression study (the “STAR*D Study”) that approximately 6.4 million of these patients have failed to achieve remission of their MDD from their prior antidepressant medication therapy and that approximately 3.8 million of those patients have commercial insurance or Medicare coverage for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. As a result, based on our expected revenues for a standard course of treatment, we believe our total annual addressable market opportunity for treatment sessions in the United States is approximately $8.9 billion.
Initial treatment options for MDD often consist of antidepressant medication prescribed by a primary care physician. Although a variety of antidepressant medications are available, drug therapy has at least two primary limitations: limited effectiveness and treatment-emergent side effects. These limitations were demonstrated in the STAR*D Study, a large clinical trial funded by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health that enrolled more than 4,000 adult MDD patients at 41 clinical sites to examine the outcomes to a sequenced series of antidepressant medication attempts that mimicked best practices. In the study, only approximately 28% and 21% of patients achieved remission in their first and second medication attempts, respectively. Many patients taking antidepressant medications experience intolerable or troubling side effects that contribute to a delay or failure in attaining an effective or optimal antidepressant dose, poor patient treatment

adherence or discontinuation of treatment therapy. The likelihood of achieving remission is limited and declines with each successive medication attempt.
TMS is considered an appropriate therapy for the treatment of MDD patients who have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from at least one prior antidepressant medication. TMS is typically performed as an office-based procedure using a capital equipment system designed to deliver the magnetic pulses necessary to stimulate the areas of the brain associated with mood. A course of treatment typically requires treatment sessions five times a week for up to six weeks that can last from as low as three to as long as forty-five minutes per session. We believe the effectiveness of TMS depends on the psychiatrist’s ability to deliver a precise amount of magnetic pulses to a specific area of the brain in a manner that can be consistently repeated during each treatment session.
We designed the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy as a non-invasive therapeutic alternative to treat patients who suffer from MDD and to address many of the key limitations of existing treatment options. We believe our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy provides our psychiatrist customers and their patients with several benefits, including clinically demonstrated response and remission with durable results, a demonstrated safety profile with limited treatment-emergent side effects and high patient adherence. Additionally, NeuroStar Advanced Therapy was designed to provide a precise and reproducible office-based therapy that is efficient and convenient. Our therapy is delivered without general anesthesia or sedation, enabling the patient to drive and resume normal activities immediately following each treatment session. We couple our product’s clinical benefits with significant practice development resources, on-site clinical training and reimbursement and service support to help our psychiatrist customers develop a successful NeuroStar Advanced Therapy practice. We also provide cloud-based practice management solutions that enhance convenience for both psychiatrists and patients. Based on our commercial data, we believe psychiatrists can recoup their initial capital investment in our system by providing a standard course of treatment to approximately 12 patients, assuming these patients receive reimbursement from Medicare or commercial insurance at rates that are similar to what our customers have observed for existing and prior patients. We believe psychiatrists can generate approximately $8,500 of average revenue per patient for a standard course of treatment, which may provide meaningful incremental income to their practices. We believe that the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy coupled with these advantages offer significant improvement over competing TMS, which lack the ability to reproduce consistent treatments, significant clinical data from randomized outcome trials, practice development resources, and a cloud-based practice management system.
The safety, effectiveness and durability of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy is supported by a large clinical data set published in 28 articles in peer-reviewed medical journals, including from 15 clinical studies that have collectively enrolled more than 1,000 adult patients suffering from MDD. Dunner, et. al. published results of a naturalistic, prospective, observational trial conducted at 42 U.S. clinical sites in 257 patients who had tried and failed to receive relief from one or more medication trials in their current MDD episode who were treated with an acute course of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. Response and remission rates at 12 months were 68% and 45% respectively as measured by CGI-S.
Our growth strategy includes expanding our commercialization efforts in the United States, expanding international opportunities and pursuing pipeline development of our therapy for additional indications. Outside the United States, our products have received marketing authorizations in the European Union and Japan. Our initial international commercial focus is Japan, which has the third largest healthcare spend globally. We have entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Teijin Pharma Limited (“Teijin”) a leading Japanese healthcare company, to further expand our commercialization efforts in this market. We are also evaluating the use of enhancements to our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System to treat additional indications related to neurological disorders.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,101 active sites utilizing our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems in the United States. We currently sell our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and recurring treatment sessions in the United States with the collaborative support of our 195 employees as of December 31, 2022. Our sales force targets an estimated 50,000 psychiatrists across 26,000 psychiatric practices in the United 

3



States, based on a 2020 dataset from Symphony Health and our own internal estimates with those practices treating approximately 42% of the total MDD patients in the United States who meet our labeled indication and are insured. Patients are reimbursed by Medicare and commercial payors in the United States for treatment sessions utilizing our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System.
We generate revenues from initial capital sales of our systems, sales of our recurring treatment sessions and from service and repair and extended warranty contracts. We derive the majority of our revenues from recurring treatment sessions. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenues of $65.2 million and had a net loss of $37.2 million. Our revenues increased 18% during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our U.S. revenues were $63.4 million, compared to $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which represented an increase of 19% compared to the prior period. Revenues from treatment sessions represented 71% of our U.S. revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 73% of our U.S. revenues for the prior year.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to maintain and extend our leadership position in TMS therapy for patients with neurohealth disorders. The key elements of our strategy include:

● | Improve customer targeting and expand our direct sales and customer support team to accelerate growth. To capture new psychiatrist customers, we plan to expand our specialized, direct sales organization that targets MDD treating psychiatric practices that accept reimbursement from private insurance and Medicare. Symphony Health estimates that there are approximately 26,300 group and solo practice sites in the United States with psychiatrists that prescribe antidepressant medications. Our direct sales force primarily targets 50,000 psychiatrists at 26,000 psychiatric practices that we estimate, based on a 2020 dataset from Symphony Health and our own internal estimates, treat approximately 2.5 million patients, representing 42% of the total MDD patients in the United States who meet our labeled indication and are insured. We estimate that approximately 1.2 million of these patients have failed prior antidepressant medication attempts in the current MDD episode and are covered by insurance that will provide reimbursement based on this medical status, resulting in a targeted total addressable market of approximately $2.8 billion. We intend to continue to expand our team of business development managers that are responsible for driving new customer acquisitions. To reach our target practices, we also plan to expand our advertising efforts, both online and through more traditional approaches, such as targeting leading psychiatric journals, practice outreach and education through monthly webcasts, attendance at key psychiatric trade shows and sponsoring clinical symposiums and product theaters.

● | Increase utilization of our new and existing active customer sites of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems. We plan to expand our sales and customer support team to increase the number of patients treated at new and existing active customer sites using our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems in the United States. We currently have 1,101 active customer sites in the United States. We currently have 39 NeuroStar practice development managers in 2022 (“PDMs”), to focus exclusively on helping increase patient utilization of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in a practice. We intend to add to this team to support our revenue growth. Our NeuroStar practice consultants focus their efforts on helping psychiatrist customers implement our 5 Stars Solution for Practice Success. We intend to make further investments in marketing resources, such as our marketing portal, which consists of customizable practice development and advertising materials, and digital patient outreach tools all of which are designed to drive patient awareness and help identify patients who can benefit from NeuroStar TMS within an existing practice and in the local community. We also plan to invest further in our direct to consumer marketing programs, which is comprised of paid search, display advertising, social media, radio, health portals and public relations.

● | Expand our international market opportunities. We primarily sell our products within the United States and also sell our products through distributors in countries where we have received regulatory approval, including Japan, Saudi Arabia, The United Arab Emirates, Singapore, and the Republic of Korea. We primarily focus our commercial efforts outside of the United States on Japan. We worked with Teijin to obtain reimbursement approval for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System in June 2019 and will continue to provide sales, marketing and clinical support to ensure our commercial success. We will continue to opportunistically evaluate additional markets outside the United States and Japan for commercial expansion.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursue enhancements of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and pipeline development for additional indications. We plan to continue our research and development efforts to enhance the hardware and software components of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System for the treatment of MDD and other neurohealth disorders.

Research and Development
We invest in research and development for the use of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System in neurohealth disorders. Throughout our history, we have provided material support to more than 65 investigator-initiated trials of such prospective additional indications. We are currently considering a number of potential new indications for the use of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System related to neurohealth disorders. 
Sales and Customer Support Team and Customer Training
As of December 31, 2022, our sales and customer support team consisted of 84 employees working collaboratively across the following departments: sales, marketing, field service and customer support, and reimbursement. In 2023, we plan to continue to expand our sales and customer support teams to have the largest direct sales and customer support team in the industry, including 47 NeuroStar practice development managers, 19 area sales managers, 7 clinical training managers, 18 field service and technical support specialists, 15 sales leaders, 8 customer service representatives, 3 inside sales managers and 10 reimbursement specialists and managers. 
Key Customers, Sales and Marketing—United States
We primarily market and sell the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and recurring treatment sessions to psychiatrists, with primary care physicians and pain management specialists representing a small percentage of our customer base. We are dependent upon a small number of customers, as the market for neurohealth disorder equipment is highly concentrated. In 2022, our largest customer acquired our second-largest customer. The combined entity accounted for over 17% of our revenue in 2022. We executed a new long-term, exclusive agreement with the customer in January 2023, which covers sales to the combined organization on what we believe are mutually beneficial terms.
We target approximately 50,000 psychiatrists across 26,000 psychiatric practices, who we estimate, based on a 2020 dataset from Symphony Health and our own internal estimates, treat approximately 42% of MDD patients who meet our labeled indication and are insured. We target these practices by the number of psychiatrists within their practices, the number of patients they treat and their acceptance of commercial insurance and Medicare. We believe that our psychiatrist targeting strategy makes for a well-defined customer base that is accessible by our direct sales organization.
We have structured our sales and customer support team with specialized roles to sell our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and recurring treatment sessions, while delivering customer service at each stage of the implementation process. Our area sales managers are responsible for identifying key customer prospects, educating them on the value of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System, gaining their commitment for capital placement and introducing them to our PDMs. Our PDMs enhance the operational experience for 

5



providers and drive implementation of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System into our customers’ practices. We created the role of clinical training manager to partner with our customers to conduct initial and ongoing on-site clinical training to ensure clinical and practice success.
Practice Management Support and Psychiatrist Training—United States
Our PDMs play a pivotal role in ensuring the success of our customers as they implement a new service line into their practice. In the early stages of implementation, they help the practice set goals, educate on the types of patients that can benefit from our therapy and train the office staff on how to talk with patients about TMS and how to use patient educational tools such as presentations, videos and starter kits. Once the practice begins treating patients, our PDMs will educate the psychiatrist on how to track clinical outcomes, interpret data and effectively convey results to existing and potential patients and referring physicians. Our PDMs also work with our customers to increase awareness with referring physicians and develop external marketing tactics. Our dedicated reimbursement managers help each practice navigate all issues regarding the reimbursement process including investigation of benefits, prior authorizations and claims documentation. This group has assisted our customers to conduct over 31,000 benefit investigations.
Psychiatrists and staff training on the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System is a key to success within each practice. Our clinical training consultants take the burden of clinical training off our NeuroStar practice consultants and provide a dedicated training resource to each customer. Clinical training consultants conduct at least a day, hands-on training course that is scheduled after system installation at each practice and also provide ongoing advanced on-site clinical training. 
Field Support—United States
Our field service engineers are responsible for maintenance, repairs and installation of upgrades. We provide a 24/7 support hotline to respond to medical information inquiries and technical questions that arise in all time zones. We pledge to have a field service engineer on-site within 24 hours of a service call. Because of the size and geographical coverage of our field service engineers and our standard 24-hour response time, NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems experience over 99% uptime, helping to ensure uninterrupted patient treatments.
International
We market our products in a few select markets outside the United States through independent distributors. In Japan, we have an exclusive distribution agreement with Teijin, for the commercialization of our products. The current term of this distribution agreement expires March 31, 2025, subject to automatic renewal unless terminated by either party.
Competition
We have competitors that sell other forms of TMS therapy, including Brainsway, Magstim, MagVenture, CloudTMS and Nexstim, that compete directly with the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System. We also face competition from pharmaceutical and other companies that develop products, such as antidepressant medications, for the treatment of neurohealth disorders.

Manufacturing and Supply
We manage all aspects of product supply through our operations team based in Malvern, Pennsylvania. We outsource the manufacturing of components and high-level assemblies, which are produced and tested to our specifications. We rely on third parties to provide components used in existing products and we expect to continue to do so for future products.
We establish our relationships with our third-party manufacturers and suppliers through supplier contracts and purchase orders. In most cases, these supplier relationships may be terminated by either party upon short notice. As of December 31, 2022, we engaged with Spartronics to supply our console; Gharieni Group GmbH to supply our chair, Molex Incorporated to supply our SenStar Treatment Link; Paragon Micro to supply our computer systems and other companies to supply components of our chairs and treatment packs.
We closely monitor our supply chains in light of the ongoing disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, shipping challenges and global conflict. We have not experienced material delays in obtaining any of our components, nor has the ready supply of finished products to our customers or clinicians been adversely affected by component supply issues.
Reimbursement, Payor Relations and Customer Support
Based on our estimates, over 65 major private insurers in the United States, including the top 25 largest private insurers and Medicare, have coverage policies for reimbursement of TMS, including NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, representing over 300 million covered lives or about 95% of the total payor covered lives in the United States.
Government Regulation
Our products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions.

7



FDA
Our products are subject to regulation as medical devices under the U.S Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (the “FDCA”), as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
In addition to U.S. regulations, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA clearance or approval for a product, we must obtain authorization before commencing clinical trials or obtain marketing authorization or approval of our products under the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States. The marketing authorization process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or premarket approval (“PMA”). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and efficacy. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and efficacy can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the quality systems regulation (“QSR”), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and efficacy of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, special labeling requirements, premarket data requirements, and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, generally requiring approval of a PMA.
Our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System is classified as a Class II medical device. We initially received marketing authorization of this device through the de novo classification process. Subsequently, we have cleared any changes made to our system through the 510(k) clearance process.
510(k) Marketing Clearance Pathway
To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from 30 to 90 days but may take significantly longer if the FDA requires additional information and places the submission on hold for up to an additional 180 days. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent 

8



to a predicate device currently on the market, it will issue a “substantially equivalent” letter, which serves as the clearance to commercially market the device.
If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” classification process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
Pre-Market Approval Process
A PMA application must be submitted if the medical device is in Class III (although the FDA has the discretion to continue to allow certain pre-amendment Class III devices to use the 510(k) process) or cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. A PMA application must be supported by, among other things, extensive technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling data to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device.
After a PMA application is submitted and filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information, which typically takes 180 days, but may take longer if the FDA requests additional information and places the submission on hold for up to an additional 180 days. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information (e.g., clinical or non-clinical data) or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA will usually be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR, which imposes elaborate design development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the design and manufacturing process. The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. New PMA applications or supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling of the product and design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an original PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
De Novo Classification Process
Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II, or III are automatically classified as Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a substantially equivalent predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification process. This process allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified as Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, (the “FDASIA”), in July 2012, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. The FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. We were granted marketing authorization for our system using the de novo classification process after receiving a not substantially equivalent determination following the 

9



submission of a 510(k) premarket notification. We have subsequently used the 510(k) clearance process to obtain authorization from the FDA for changes to our system, including for our TouchStar® treatment, a three-minute intermittent theta burst protocol delivered by our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System, which was cleared by the FDA on November 23, 2020.
Clinical Trials
A clinical trial is typically required to support a PMA application or de novo classification and is sometimes required for a 510(k) pre-market notification, particularly in the case of changes to indications. Clinical trials for significant risk devices generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the investigational protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA as well as the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites, and the informed consent of the patients participating in the clinical trial is obtained. After a trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate it if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Any trials we conduct must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations as well as other federal regulations and state laws concerning human subject protection and privacy. Moreover, the results of a clinical trial may not be sufficient to obtain clearance or approval of the product.
Changes to Marketed Devices
After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, or de novo classification, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will typically require a new 510(k) marketing clearance but may, depending on the modification, require a de novo classification or PMA approval. Depending on the scope of the change, a traditional, special, or abbreviated 510(k) application may be submitted. Compared to a traditional 510(k), a special 510(k) application may be used in special cases where: 1) the manufacturer makes a change to their own device; 2) performance data is unnecessary or well-established methods are available to evaluate the change; and 3) performance data necessary to demonstrate substantial equivalence can be presented in a summary or risk analysis format. In this case, the review time is shorter (approximately 30 days), compared to the review time of approximately 90 days for the traditional 510(k) pathway. Alternatively, the abbreviated 510(k) pathway may be used when the submission relies on FDA guidance documents, demonstration of compliance with special controls for the device type, and voluntary consensus standards. This pathway has a review time of approximately 90 days. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine which pathway is most appropriate; however, in the event that the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, it may ask the manufacturer to convert its application to another type (e.g., if the FDA determines that it requires additional information about the performance testing beyond the summary data, it may ask the manufacturer to convert a special 510(k) to a traditional 510(k)). 
Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a manufacturer documenting the change in an internal letter-to-file (a “LTF”). The LTF is documented in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) or PMA to obtain clearance or approval for every change and includes the rationale for why a submission was not filed. The changes contained in the LTFs are then summarized and included within the following 510(k) or PMA submission. The FDA will review these changes during the submission process or during an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.

Post-Market Regulation
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

● | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers and contract manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and, manufacturing , and distribution process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or serious adverse events, if the malfunction were to recur;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | complying with regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may be subject to similar foreign laws that may include applicable post-marketing requirements, such as ongoing safety/ malfunction surveillance and risk management. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including voluntary or mandatory device corrections or removals.

11



The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:

● | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been authorized;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal to authorize export or import approvals for our products; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | criminal prosecution.

U.S. and Foreign Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation, prescription and payment for medical treatments. A medical device manufacturer’s arrangements with third-party payors, providers and patients may expose it to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may affect its business or the financial arrangements and relationships through which it markets, sells and distributes its products. Even if a medical device manufacturer does not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid, other federal healthcare programs, or other third-party payors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations are applicable to its business. In addition, a portion of our business is subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (“HIPAA”), as a business associate of our covered entity customers. To provide our covered entity customers with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information (“PHI”), we are required to enter into business associate agreements. As a business associate, we are also directly liable for compliance with HIPAA. The laws that may affect a medical device manufacturer’s ability to operate include, but are not limited to:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The government can establish a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute without proving that a person or entity had actual knowledge of the law or a specific intent to violate. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim for reimbursement that includes items resulting from a violation of the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (“FCA”). Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend medical device products, including discounts, or engaging individuals as speakers, consultants, or advisors, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exception or a safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe

12




harbors for many common practices, such as reimbursement support programs, educational or research grants, or charitable donations;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, such as the FCA, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibits individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false, fictitious or fraudulent claims for payment of federal funds, and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The Social Security Act also has a provision that provides for the imposition of civil monetary penalties against any person who offers or transfers remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that such person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier for the order or receipt of any item or service payable by a federal health care program. Private individuals, commonly known as “whistleblowers,” can bring FCA qui tam actions on behalf of the government and themselves, and may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in recovery or settlement. False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties of $13,508 to $27,018 (as of January 2023) per false or fraudulent claim or statement. Many pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers have been investigated and have reached substantial settlements under the FCA in connection with alleged off label promotion of their products and allegedly providing free products to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal health care programs for the product. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. There are also criminal penalties, including imprisonment and criminal fines, for making or presenting false, fictitious or fraudulent claims to the federal government;

● | HIPAA, among other things, established various criminal health care fraud laws, which impose criminal liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the applicable statute or specific intent to violate it or to have committed a violation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their implementing regulations, which imposes privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon “covered entities” subject to the law, including health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers and their respective business associates that perform services on their behalf that involve individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. On December 10, 2020, and later on January 21, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which if

finalized, would make changes to some of HIPAA’s regulatory requirements, which would apply to business associates;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Physician Payments Sunshine Act,” created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”), which requires, among other things, certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services,(“CMS”), information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers are required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives; and

● | foreign and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may impose similar or more prohibitive restrictions, and may apply to items or services reimbursed by any non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require device manufacturers to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; and other federal and state laws that govern the privacy and security of health information or personally identifiable information in certain circumstances, including state health information privacy and data breach notification laws which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus requiring additional compliance efforts and data privacy and security laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions that may be more stringent than those in the United States (such as the European Union, which adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of their statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of a medical device manufacturer’s business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry.
Ensuring that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. If a medical device manufacturer’s operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to it, it may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, substantial monetary penalties, individual imprisonment, exclusion from governmental funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting obligations and oversight if it becomes subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect the ability of a medical device manufacturer to operate its business and the results of its operations.

United States Healthcare Reform
In the United States, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals have been considered or enacted to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect a medical device manufacturer’s business. Among policy makers and governmental and private insurers in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. For example, in 2010, the PPACA was enacted, which include measures to significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the medical device industry. Among other ways in which it may impact a medical device manufacturer’s business, the PPACA:

● | established a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical efficacy research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

Some of the provisions of the PPACA have yet to be implemented, and there were judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the PPACA. Most recently, under President Biden, the Department of Justice dropped support of two Supreme Court cases challenging PPACA in addition to a case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On January 28, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order to expand access to PPACA coverage, stating that it is the “policy” of the Biden administration to protect and strengthen the PPACA and directing agencies to consider suspending, revising, or rescinding actions related to President Trump’s executive orders that are inconsistent with this policy position. In the past, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA; however, this is not the policy of the Biden administration. There is no way to know whether, and to what extent, if any, the PPACA will remain in-effect in the future, and it is unclear how judicial decisions, subsequent appeals, or other efforts to repeal and replace or, possibly, to restore the PPACA will impact the U.S. healthcare industry or our business.
Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, reduce the cost of certain products under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies. At the state level, individual states in the United States are also increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures.
It is likely that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for a medical device manufacturer’s products or additional pricing pressure.
We cannot predict the impact that health care reform under the Biden administration will have on our business, and there is uncertainty as to what healthcare programs and regulations may be implemented or changed at the federal and/or state level in the United States, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation. However, it is possible that such initiatives could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain approval and/or successfully commercialize products in the United States in the future. For example, U.S. federal government and state legislatures have continued to implement cost containment programs, including 

15



price controls and restrictions on coverage and reimbursement. To contain costs, governmental healthcare programs and third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price, scrutinizing the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical treatments. Any changes that reduce, or impede the ability to obtain, reimbursement for the type of products we intend to commercialize in the United States (or our products more specifically, if approved) or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business plan to introduce our products in the United States.
Japanese Regulation
In Japan, medical devices are regulated mainly under the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Act. This act was implemented on November 25, 2014 and served as a revision to the original Pharmaceutical Affairs Law of 2005. Under this regulation, medical devices must be approved prior to importation and commercial sale by the Pharmaceutical Medical Device Agency (“PMDA”) and Ministry of Health and Welfare (“MHLW”). The PMDA is the MHLW-created, quasi-independent agency that was established to review and approve pharmaceutics and medical devices for marketing in Japan. They are also responsible for Japan Good Manufacturing Practices audits, clinical studies oversight, and facility licensing. The approval process identifies a Marketing Authorization Holder (“MAH”), who is designated as the only authorized seller of products. Manufacturers of medical devices outside of Japan who do not operate through a Japanese entity are able to designate a MAH, known as a designated MAH (“D-MAH”), who will apply for product approval and take responsibility for the medical device within Japan. After receiving PMDA’s recommendations for marketing approval, the MHLW will ultimately evaluate and approve those pharmaceutics and medical devices deemed to be safe and effective. As part of its approval process, the MHLW may require that the product be tested in Japanese laboratories. The approval process ranges in length between two and twelve months, depending on the submission type (e.g., Todokede – for Class I devices, Ninsho – for Class II and III devices, or Shonin for Class II through IV devices). Since the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System is classified as a Class III device by Japan’s definition, Neuronetics has followed the Shonin process for pre-market approval. After approval is received, the MHLW issues a Shonin approval to Neuronetics’ D-MAH, thereby permitting such entity to import the device into Japan for sale. The MHLW is also responsible for creating policies, regulations, guidance documents, and laws, and governs safe use of medical products as well as for social insurance, reimbursement policies, and pricing.
After a device is approved for importation and commercial sale in Japan, the MHLW continues to monitor sales of approved products for compliance with labeling regulations, which prohibit promotion of devices for unapproved uses, and reporting regulations, which require reporting of product malfunctions, including serious injury or death caused by any approved device. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the MHLW, which may include fines, injunctions, and civil penalties, recall or seizure of our products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of sales in Japan, or criminal prosecution.
European Union Regulation
Neuronetics has received European Conformity (“CE”) certification under the European Union (“EU” or “E.U.”) Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) (2017/745). This CE mark provides market authorization within the EU and European Economic Area (“EEA”). In the EU, a single regulatory approval process exists, in which a Notified Body assesses the conformity of the medical device intended to be marketed with the legal requirements set forth in the EU MDR. To obtain a CE mark, medical devices and their accessories must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and then, according to their classification, comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. After conformity is confirmed, the CE mark is affixed to the medical device itself or on its packaging, thus indicating its conformity status. The competent authorities of the EU countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. 
Other International Regulation

16



Sales and marketing of medical devices outside of the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. The global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and ultimately, our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products. The time required to obtain appropriate marketing authorizations from other foreign authorities may be substantially longer or shorter than required for FDA approval. Some countries may not require any special registration process prior to importing and marketing the device. Whether or not we have obtained FDA approval, our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System may be subject to different regulatory requirements in other jurisdictions. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all the risks associated with FDA regulation, as well as country-specific regulations.
Other Regulations
Import-export. Our international operations enable us to be subjected to laws regarding sanctioned countries, entities and persons, customs, and import-export. Among other things, these laws restrict, and in some cases can prevent, U.S. companies from directly or indirectly selling goods, technology or services to people or entities in certain countries. In addition, these laws require that we exercise care in our business dealings with entities in and from foreign countries.
Data Privacy and Cybersecurity Laws and Regulations. As a business with a significant global footprint, compliance with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity (relating to the confidentiality and security of our information technology systems, products such as medical devices, and other services provided by us) may result in increased costs, lower revenue, new complexities in compliance, new challenges for competition, and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity. Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including personal information, financial information, intellectual property, and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce.
For example, in the U.S. the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of certain personal information and the security of medical devices are regulated at the U.S. federal and state, and industry levels. U.S. federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by health care providers. In addition, the FDA has issued guidance advising manufacturers to take cybersecurity risks into account in product design for connected medical devices and systems, to assure that appropriate safeguards are in place to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or modification to medical devices that contain software and reduce the risk of introducing threats into hospital systems that are connected to such devices. The FDA also issued guidance on the post market management of cybersecurity in medical devices.
Outside the U.S., we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international, national and regional level, and on an industry specific basis. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data and, potentially, intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes.
