ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a leading developer of semiconductor processing solutions for video that enable high-definition, or HD, video capture, analysis, sharing and display. A device that captures video includes four primary components: a lens, an image sensor, a video processor and storage memory. The video processor is the most complex of these four primary components as it converts raw video input into a format that can be stored and distributed efficiently and, in some cases, analyzes the video data to automate processes and make intelligent decisions. We combine our processor design capabilities with our expertise in video and image processing, computer vision algorithms and software development to provide a technology platform that is designed to be easily scalable across multiple applications in a variety of markets and enable rapid and efficient product development for our customers. Our system-on-a-chip, or SoC, designs fully integrate HD video processing, image processing, computer vision functionality, audio processing, and system functions onto a single chip, delivering exceptional video and image quality at high compression rates, differentiated functionality and low power consumption.  
 The flexibility of our technology platform enables us to deliver our solutions for numerous applications in multiple markets. We initially focused our technology platform on the broadcast infrastructure market, where we were able to differentiate our solutions for broadcast customers based on high performance, low power consumption, transmission and storage efficiency and small form factor. Leveraging these same capabilities, we then designed high-performance solutions for the camera market. As a result of the advantages of our solutions, we became a leading provider of video processing solutions for cameras that capture both HD video and high-resolution still images simultaneously, such as camcorders, pocket video cameras, wearable cameras and IP security cameras. 
 Over the last several years, we have been expanding our development efforts on computer vision technology that complements our image processing and video compression technology. We believe that enhanced computer vision functionality is critical both to our current video markets, such as IP security cameras, as well as future markets such as automotive OEM cameras for advanced driving assistance systems, or ADAS, autonomous vehicles, and in the future, robotic applications. Our development efforts focused on creating advanced computer vision algorithms and high-performance, low-power hardware platforms to enhance processing acceleration, which we refer to as our CVflow architecture. The CVflow architecture supports a variety of computer vision algorithms, including stereo obstacle detection and terrain mapping technology, and allows customers to differentiate their products by porting their own algorithms and neural networks to our CVflow-based chips. In 2017, we introduced our first computer vision semiconductor chip, the CV1 SoC. In 2018, we introduced three new computer vision based SoCs to enable our customers to develop intelligent camera systems for a variety of markets at different feature levels. 
 Our revenue over the last three years has been generated primarily from sales of our solutions for incorporation into specialized video and image capture devices such as wearable sports cameras, automotive aftermarket cameras, IP security cameras and cameras incorporated into unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs or drones. While we will continue to address these markets, we intend to primarily focus our development efforts on computer vision applications for the professional and consumer IP security camera, including cameras for the connected home, the automotive OEM and robotics markets. In the IP security camera market, our computer vision platform enables features such as motion detection, people counting and tracking, package and object detection, and facial recognition.  In the automotive market, we supply solutions for video recorders, in-cabin and driver monitoring cameras, electronic mirrors, around view monitoring, front camera advanced driving assistance systems, and autonomous driving systems. We have also sought to establish partnerships with software developers for the automotive market to enable advanced artificial intelligence, or AI, features such as object classification, free space detection, path planning, and driver monitoring.

 Industry Background 
 The requirements for cameras in the markets we address are consistently evolving.  For our key target markets of IP security cameras, automotive and industrial and robotics applications, these requirements center around computer vision functionality, video definition and frame rates, ability to capture high-quality still images and video, and advanced video features: 

• | Computer Vision. Computer vision represents the field of methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding images and high-dimensional data from the real world in order to automate and integrate a wide range of processes. Computer vision is becoming increasingly important for the development of intelligent video camera systems. In the IP security camera market, computer vision can be used for various functions including motion detection to trigger alarms, the counting and tracking of people, and facial recognition. In the automotive market, the application of computer vision for ADAS is increasingly being used to help drivers with functions that include lane detection warning, forward collision warning, blind spot detection, and driver monitoring. Support for stereo video obstacle detection, which utilizes stereo cameras to perceive depth, provides an important augmentation to monocular computer vision processing, resulting in an extra margin of safety for autonomous driving and other applications, as stereo cameras can detect obstacles without relying on prior training. The application of computer vision may also be used to help control the video encoding process to reduce video bitrates and maximize network efficiency.

• | Higher Definition and Higher Frame Rates. The demand for enhanced video resolution has been increasing across camera markets. Consumers expect video quality to be closer to high-resolution still images, which continues to drive the transition from standard definition to Full HD and beyond. Similarly, as new display technologies enable higher resolutions and higher frame rates, we believe consumer demand will continue to drive the requirement for ultra high-definition, or UHD or 4K, video capture and transmission.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Ability to Capture High-Quality Still Images and Video. Historically, consumers purchased devices that either provide high-quality image capture or record high-quality video. This was the result of consumer preference, as reasonably priced and sized devices would provide only one of those attributes. However, as a result of technological improvements, consumer devices that deliver both attributes have proliferated to the point that a pure video capture device or still image capture device is becoming uncommon. Increasingly, devices are able to simultaneously capture HD video and high-quality still images without adversely impacting the quality of either. We believe devices that can capture Full HD video while encoding a second mobile resolution video for uploading to the Internet or streaming over a Wi-Fi network will expand consumer demand for specialized video capture devices. Additionally, we believe advanced low-light processing including high dynamic range and high-ISO processing will continue to improve image quality even in challenging lighting conditions. We believe image stabilization technology enables stable video recording during high-motion conditions, which are often encountered when using sports cameras and UAVs.

• | Connectivity. Integrated wireless capability using wireless links such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi has become a prevalent feature across many classes of video capture devices. Consumers want to watch, control and capture real-time video using their smartphones as the remote control and viewer for wirelessly enabled wearable and sports cameras. Additionally, rather than storing images and video to local media and transferring to a computer later, consumers are demanding the ability to wirelessly transfer and share their video content to websites such as YouTube, Facebook and other online media albums. In video security applications, connectivity to cloud services enable smart home monitoring in real-time through smartphones or tablets. The storage of video in the cloud also provides protection against theft of the video content and enables users the capability to play back the stored video.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to Deliver Feature-Rich Video. The addition of de-warping capability allows cameras to utilize a wide angle or “fish eye” lens to cover a wide viewing area. In security applications this capability can allow a single camera to replace multiple cameras and may also eliminate the need for mechanical pan-tilt-zoom in the cameras. In automotive markets, the ability to combine and display images captured by multiple cameras can allow the automotive camera recorder to capture and display images from the front, rear and sides of the car, which is referred to as around view monitoring. Wide dynamic range, or WDR, and high dynamic range, or HDR, processing capabilities provide greater dynamic range between the lightest and darkest areas of an image, permitting captured still images to reveal details that would otherwise be lost against a bright background.

 Our technology platform, comprised of our video, image and computer vision processors, is based on a high-performance, low-power architecture supported by a high level of system integration. The building blocks of our platform are illustrated below: 

Our technology platform enables the capture of high-resolution still images and HD video while simultaneously encoding HD video for high-quality storage and lower resolution video for Internet sharing and wireless networking. Multi stream video capture enhances the consumer experience by offering the ability to instantaneously share captured video without having to go through a transcoding process. Our computer stereo vision processing solutions provide the ability to detect generic objects without training, allowing more robust decisions to be made in applications such as autonomous driving.
 AmbaClear 
 Our proprietary image signal processing architecture, known as AmbaClear, incorporates advanced algorithms to convert raw sensor data to high-resolution still and HD video images concurrently. Image processing algorithms include sensor, lens and color correction, demosaicing, which is a process used to reconstruct a full color image from incomplete color samples, noise filtering, detail enhancement and image format conversion. For example, raw sensor data can be captured at up to 16-megapixel resolution at 60 frames per second and filtered down to two megapixels for HD video processing while selected 16-megapixel frames are concurrently processed by the still image processor. This image processing reduces noise in the input video and improves video quality resulting in better storage and transmission efficiencies. Our WDR and HDR processing capabilities handle greater dynamic range between the lightest and darkest areas of an image, permitting video images to reveal details that would otherwise be lost against a bright background. Our advanced de-warping capability enables cameras to use wide angle lenses to capture images from a wide area, making it ideal for a variety of IP security camera and surround view applications.

AmbaCast 
 Our proprietary HD video processing architecture, known as AmbaCast, incorporates advanced algorithms for motion estimation, motion-compensated 3D temporal filtering, mode decision and rate control. Successful implementation of these computationally intensive steps has helped us maximize compression efficiency. We support all three compression profiles—baseline, main and high—as specified in the H.264 video compression standard. We also support the main profile H.265 video compression standard with up to 2x better compression efficiency compared to our H.264 video compression technology.
 CVflow
 Our proprietary computer vision processing architecture, known as CVflow, uses a flexible computer vision hardware engine programmed with a high level algorithm description to achieve increased performance while minimizing die size and power consumption. This description allows the hardware to maximize use of its resources by exploiting all available parallelism without software intervention.  The CVflow architecture specifies data flow connections between a set of optimized computer vision operators, such as the convolution and matrix multiply functions that are specifically optimized for deep learning algorithms. The CVflow architecture supports a variety of computer vision algorithms, including stereo obstacle detection and terrain mapping technology.  Our platform allows customers to differentiate their products by porting their own algorithms and neural networks to our CVflow-based chips using industry-standard training tools and frameworks.
 Computer Vision Technology
 Computer vision is a core technology that complements our image processing and video compression technology. Our current SoC solutions have up to four high performance ARM processors with NEONTM acceleration that provide a flexible and cost-effective manner in which to run computer vision algorithms. We are focusing on developing advanced computer vision algorithms and high-performance, low-power hardware acceleration, which is critical to our current video markets, including IP security, wearable, and UAV cameras, as well as automotive cameras for OEM applications.  A significant feature of our computer vision SoCs is support for stereo obstacle detection, which utilizes stereo cameras to perceive depth. We believe that stereo depth information provides an important augmentation to monocular computer vision processing, resulting in an extra margin of safety for autonomous driving and other applications. Monocular processing depends on training to detect obstacles, and may not detect obstacles that are not represented in the training set. Stereo cameras detect obstacles without relying on training because the depth information is used to directly construct a three-dimensional model of the camera’s surroundings, including any obstacles.   
Design Methodology 
 The success of our technology platform stems from our algorithm-driven design methodology. We test and verify our algorithms on our proprietary architectural model prior to implementing our algorithms in hardware. Our advanced verification methodology validates our approach through simultaneous modeling of architecture, algorithms and the hardware itself. This redundant approach enables us to identify and remediate any weaknesses early in the development cycle, providing a solid foundation on which we build our hardware implementation, and enhances our ability to achieve first-pass silicon success. We have a history of using several process nodes from 130nm through 10nm. In fiscal year 2015, we began investing in development of our next generation SoCs in the 14nm process node and announced our first 14 nm SoC in January 2016.  In fiscal year 2017, we began investing in development of our next generation SoCs in the 10nm process node, and we announced our first 10nm SoC in January 2018. We possess extensive expertise in video and imaging algorithms as well as deep sub-micron digital and mixed-signal design experience.

Our multi-core DSP architecture is highly scalable and balances software programmability with hardware-accelerated performance to achieve extremely low power consumption and maximize camera battery life. The programmable architecture provides our customers with the flexibility they need to quickly develop a wide range of differentiated products. Additionally, our SoCs integrate mixed signal (analog/digital) functionality and high speed interfaces required for interfacing to advanced high-speed CMOS sensors and industry standard interfaces such as USB 3.0 and HDMI 2.0.

Software Development Kits 
 We provide to our customers fully-functional software development kits with a suite of application programming interfaces or APIs, which allow customers to rapidly integrate our solution, adjust product specifications and provide additional functionality to their systems, thereby enabling them to differentiate their product offerings and reduce time to market. We have software development kits for all of our core markets. For example, in the security market, we provide a fully-featured IP Camera Software Development Kit, or the IP Camera SDK, based on a LinuxTM operating system.  The IP Camera SDK includes middleware software with multi-streaming capability, control for our 4K H.264/H.265 encoder hardware, support for peripherals such as sensors and Wi-Fi chipsets, and other functions needed to build a 4K Ultra HD multi-streaming IP camera. The IP Camera SDK leverages our SoCs’ capabilities for 4K video, multi-streaming, HDR, video de-warping, video analytics, and multi-sensor connectivity. For example, the IP Camera SDK enables an IP camera to record a stream locally at 4K resolution while streaming another video to a remote client over an Ethernet connection at reduced resolution. We also provide extensions to the IP Camera SDK to address specific submarket segments such as doorbells and battery-powered cameras, which can take advantage of the fast-boot, low power, and advanced multi-view video modes of our chips. 
 We also provide a toolkit to accelerate the development of computer vision algorithms onto our hardware. We provide tools to map algorithms from commonly used computer vision frameworks such as Caffe or Tensorflow into our proprietary CVflow architecture. We also provide a framework for development of higher-level computer vision tasks.  This enables our customers to write complex computer vision algorithms with multiple tasks running in parallel, as would be required in applications such as autonomous driving.

Customers 
 We sell our solutions to leading original design manufacturers, or ODMs, and original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, globally. In the automotive market, we may sell our solutions to Tier 1 suppliers that develop and sell devices incorporating our solutions to automotive OEMs. We refer to ODMs and Tier 1 suppliers as our customers and OEMs as our end customers, except as otherwise indicated or as the context otherwise requires. In the camera market, our video processing solutions are designed into products from leading OEMs including Axis Communications AB, Avigilon Corporation, Dahua Technology Co., Ltd., DJI, Denso Ten Limited, Garmin Ltd., GoPro, Hikvision Digital Technology Co., JVC Kenwood Corporation and affiliated entities, Nest Labs (owned by Google LLC, which is owned by Alphabet, Inc.), Pelco by Schneider Electric SE, Ring, Inc. (owned by Amazon, Inc.), Robert Bosch GmbH and affiliated entities, Thinkware Corporation, Vivotek, and XiaoYi Technology Co., Ltd., who source our solutions from ODMs including Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd., Dynacolor, Inc., Flex Ltd., and affiliated entities, affiliated entities of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Jabil Circuit, Inc., Sercomm Corporation, and Sky Light Digital Ltd.  
 Sales to customers in Asia accounted for approximately 87%, 79% and 73% of our total revenue in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As many of our OEM end customers or their ODM manufacturers are located in Asia, we anticipate that a majority of our revenue will continue to come from sales to customers in that region. Although a large percentage of our sales are made to customers in Asia, we believe that a significant number of the products designed by these customers and incorporating our SoCs are then sold to consumers globally. For each fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, 98% of our revenue was attributable to sales of our solutions into the camera markets and 2% of our revenue was attributable to sales of our solutions into the infrastructure market. To date, all of our sales have been denominated in U.S. dollars. 
 We work closely with our end customer OEMs and ODMs throughout their product design cycles that often last six to nine months for the camera market, although new products within the camera market may have longer design cycles, particularly those implementing advanced features. As a result, we are able to develop long-term relationships with our customers as our technology becomes embedded in their products. Consequently, we believe we are well positioned to not only be designed into our customers’ current products, but also to continually develop next-generation HD video and image processing solutions for their future products. 
 The product life cycles in the camera market typically range from six to 18 months. We expect that product lifecycles in the automotive OEM and the industrial and robotics markets will typically be longer than 24 months, as new product introductions occur less frequently. For many of our solutions, early engagement with our customers’ technical staff is necessary for success. To ensure an adequate level of early engagement, our application and development engineers work closely with our customers to adjust product specifications and add functionality into their products. 
 In fiscal year 2019, the customers representing 10% or more of revenue were Wintech, the Company’s distributor, and Chicony, a direct ODM customer, which accounted for approximately 58% and 16% of total revenue, respectively. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We sell our solutions worldwide using our direct sales force and our distributors. We have direct sales personnel covering the United States, Asia and Europe, and we operate sales offices in Santa Clara, California and Hong Kong, and business development offices in China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. In addition, in each of these locations we employ a staff of field applications engineers to provide direct engineering support locally to our customers. 
 Our sales cycles typically require a significant investment of time and a substantial expenditure of resources before we can realize revenue from the sale of our solutions, if any. Our typical sales cycle consists of a multi-month sales and development process involving our customers’ system designers and management and our sales personnel and software engineers. If successful, this process culminates in a customer’s decision to use our solutions in its system, which we refer to as a design win. Our sales efforts are typically directed to the OEM of the product that will incorporate our video and image processing solution, but the eventual design and incorporation of our SoC into the product may be handled by an ODM or Tier I supplier on behalf of the OEM. Volume production may begin within six to 18 months after a design win, depending on the complexity of our customer’s product and other factors upon which we may have little or no influence. Once our solutions have been incorporated into a customer’s design, they are likely to be used for the life cycle of the customer’s product. Conversely, a design loss to a competitor will likely preclude any opportunity for future revenue from such customer’s product.

The end markets into which we sell our products have seen significant changes as consumer preferences have evolved in response to new technologies. As a result, the composition of our revenue may differ meaningfully during periods of technology or consumer preference changes. For example, in fiscal year 2011, revenue from sales into the pocket video market represented approximately 40% of our total revenue. The proliferation of smartphones and their ability to capture high-quality video and still images significantly impacted this market, decreasing pocket video cameras’ contribution to approximately zero percent of total revenue by fiscal year 2013. Conversely, our total revenue in the 2013-2018 fiscal years was primarily derived from markets for specialized video and image capture devices, such as the wearable camera market, the IP security camera market, the automotive aftermarket and the UAV camera market. While we will continue to address these markets, we intend to primarily focus our development efforts on computer vision applications for the professional and consumer IP security, the automotive OEM and industrial and robotics markets. We expect shifts in consumer use of video capture to continue to change over time, as more specialized use cases emerge and video capture continues to proliferate, which could significantly impact any of these markets. 
 Our sales are generally made pursuant to purchase orders received approximately four to 18 weeks prior to the scheduled product delivery date, depending upon agreed terms with our customers and the current manufacturing lead time at the time the purchase order is received. These purchase orders may be cancelled without charge upon notification within an agreed period of time in advance of the delivery date, which may be as short as 30 days. Due to the scheduling requirements of our foundry, assembly and test contractors, we generally provide our contractors with our production forecasts and place firm orders for products with our suppliers up to 20 weeks prior to the anticipated delivery date, usually without a purchase order from our own customers. Our standard warranty provides that our SoCs containing defects in materials, workmanship or performance may be returned for a refund of the purchase price or for replacement, at our discretion. We may agree to different warranty terms with specific customers from time to time.
 Manufacturing 
 We employ a fabless business model and use third-party foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture, assemble and test our solutions. This outsourced manufacturing approach allows us to focus our resources on the design, sales and marketing of our solutions and avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facility. Our engineers work closely with foundries and other contractors to increase yields, lower manufacturing costs and improve quality. In addition, we believe outsourcing many of our manufacturing and assembly activities provides us the flexibility needed to respond to new market opportunities, simplifies our operations and significantly reduces our capital requirements. We do not have a guaranteed level of production capacity from any of our suppliers’ facilities to produce our solutions. We carefully qualify each of our suppliers and their subcontractors and processes in order to meet the extremely high-quality and reliability standards required of our solutions. 
Backlog 
 Our sales are primarily made through standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance non-binding commitments from customers as to future purchases. We follow industry practice that allows customers to cancel, change or defer orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment. Given this practice, we do not believe that backlog is a reliable indicator of future revenue levels. 
Wafer Fabrication 
 We have a history of using several process nodes from 130nm through 10nm. We currently manufacture the majority of our solutions in 28nm silicon wafer production process geometry utilizing the services of several different foundries. In fiscal year 2015, we began investing in development in the 14nm process node, and we announced our first 14nm SoC in January 2016. In fiscal year 2017, we began investing in development in the 10nm process node, and we announced our first 10nm SoC in January 2018. Currently, the majority of our SoCs are supplied by Samsung in facilities located in Austin, Texas and South Korea, from whom we have the option to purchase both fully-assembled and tested products as well as tested die in wafer form for assembly. We also have products supplied by Global UniChip Corporation, or GUC, in Taiwan, from whom we purchase fully-assembled and tested products. The wafers used by GUC in the assembly of our products are manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd., or TSMC, in Taiwan. 
 14


Assembly and Testing 
 Samsung subcontracts the assembly and initial testing of the assembled chips it supplies to us to Signetics Corporation and STATS ChipPAC Ltd. In the case of purchases of tested die from Samsung, we contract the assembly to Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., or ASE. GUC subcontracts the assembly of the products it supplies to us to ASE and Powertech Technology Inc. Final testing of all of our products is handled by King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd. or Sigurd Corporation under the supervision of our engineers. All test software and related processes for our products are developed by our engineers. We continually monitor the results of testing at all of our test contractors to ensure that our testing procedures are properly implemented. 
 As part of our total quality assurance program, our quality management system has been certified to ISO 9001:2000 standards. Our foundry vendors are also ISO 9001 certified. 
 Research and Development 
 We believe our technology is a competitive advantage and we engage in substantial research and development efforts to develop new products and integrate additional features and capabilities into our HD and UHD video processing solutions, such as computer vision capabilities. We believe that our continued success depends on our ability to both introduce improved versions of our existing solutions and to develop new solutions for the markets that we serve. As of January 31, 2019, 81% of our employees are engaged in research and development. Our research and development team is comprised of both semiconductor and software designers. Our semiconductor design team has extensive experience in large-scale semiconductor design, including architecture description, logic and circuit design, implementation and verification. Our software design team has extensive experience in development and verification of software for the HD video market. Because the integration of hardware and software is a key competitive advantage of our solutions, our hardware and software design teams work closely together throughout the product development process. The experience of our hardware and software design teams enables us to effectively assess the tradeoffs and advantages when determining which features and capabilities of our solutions should be implemented in hardware and in software. 
 We have assembled a core team of experienced engineers and systems designers in four research and development design centers located in the United States, China, Italy, and Taiwan. 
 Competition 
 The global semiconductor market in general, and the video and image processing markets in particular, are highly competitive. We expect competition to increase and intensify as more and larger semiconductor companies enter our markets and as we enter new markets, such as the OEM automotive market. Increased competition could result in price pressure, reduced profitability and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue and operating results. 
 Our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets. In the IP security camera market, our primary competitors include AMLogic Inc., Fullhan Microelectronics Co., Ltd., Geo Semiconductor, Inc., HiSilicon Technologies Co., Ltd., or HiSilicon, which is owned by Huawei Technologies Co., Ingenic Semiconductor Co., Ltd., Intel Corporation, or Intel, Movidius Ltd., a subsidiary of Intel, Novatek Microelectronics Corp., or Novatek, OmniVision Technologies, Inc., or OmniVision, Qualcomm Incorporated, or Qualcomm, Realtek Semiconductor Corp., SigmaStar Technology Corp., or SigmaStar, Socionext Inc., or Socionext, an entity created from the merger of the system LSI businesses of Fujitsu Ltd. and Panasonic Corporation, or Panasonic, and Texas Instruments Incorporated, or Texas Instruments, as well as vertically integrated divisions of IP Security camera device OEMs, including Axis Communications AB and Sony Corporation, or Sony. In the automotive camera market, we compete against Allwinner Technology Co., Ltd., Alpha Imaging Technology Corp., Core Logic, Inc., Novatek, NVIDIA Corporation, or NVIDIA, NXP Semiconductors N.V., OmniVision, Qualcomm, Renesas Electronics Corporation, SigmaStar, Sunplus Technology Co. Ltd., Texas Instruments and Xilinx Inc. In the wearable sports camera market, our primary competitors are vertically integrated divisions of camera device OEMs, including Sony, Panasonic, HiSilicon and Socionext. Our primary competitors in the UAV camera market include HiSilicon, Intel, NVIDIA and Qualcomm. Certain of our customers and suppliers also have divisions that produce products competitive with ours.
 Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including industry and general economic trends. Many of our competitors are substantially larger, have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support and other resources, are more established than we are, and have significantly better brand recognition and broader product offerings which may enable them to develop and enable new technology into product solutions better or faster than us and to better withstand adverse economic or market conditions in the future.

Our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving HD video market depends on several factors, including: 
  
• | the design and manufacturing of new solutions, including software, that anticipate the video processing and integration needs of our customers’ next-generation products and applications;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of our computer vision solutions, as measured by convolutional neural network performance, video and still picture image quality, resolution and frame processing rates;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | power consumption efficiency of our solutions;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | the ease of implementation of our products by customers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | the strength of customer relationships;
--+----------------------------------------


• | the selection of the foundry process technology and architecture tradeoffs to meet customers’ product requirements in a timely manner;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reputation and reliability;
--+----------------------------


• | customer support; and
--+----------------------


• | the cost of the total solution.
--+--------------------------------

 We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors, particularly because our solutions typically provide high-performance and low power consumption video, CNN performance, efficient integration of our advanced algorithms, exceptional storage and transmission efficiencies at lower power, highly-integrated SoC solutions based on a scalable platform, and comprehensive and flexible software. We cannot ensure, however, that our solutions will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products introduced by existing or new competitors. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, and contractual protections, to protect our core technology and intellectual property. As of January 31, 2019, we had 137 issued patents in the United States, 53 of which were continuation patents, six patents issued in Europe, five issued patents in China, six issued patents in Japan and 76 pending patent applications in the United States. The issued patents in the United States expire beginning in 2024 through 2035. Many of our issued patents and pending patent applications relate to image and video processing and HD video compression. 
 We may not receive competitive advantages from any rights granted under our patents, and our patent applications may not result in the issuance of any new patents. In addition, any patent we hold may be opposed, contested, circumvented, designed around by a third party or found to be unenforceable or invalidated. Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies, duplicate our proprietary technologies or design around patents owned or licensed by us. 
 In addition to our own intellectual property, we also use third-party licenses for certain technologies embedded in our SoC solutions. These are typically non-exclusive contracts provided under royalty-accruing or paid-up licenses. These licenses are generally perpetual or automatically renewed for so long as we continue to pay any maintenance fees that may be due. To date, maintenance fees have not constituted a significant portion of our capital expenditures. While we do not believe our business is dependent to any significant degree on any individual third-party license, we expect to continue to use and may license additional third-party technology for our solutions. 
 We generally control access to and use of our confidential information through employing internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors and customers. We rely in part on U.S. and international copyright laws to protect our mask work. All employees and consultants are required to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment and consulting relationships with us. We also require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived or made in connection with the employment or consulting relationship. 
 Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary intellectual property. In addition, we continue to operate internationally, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. 
 16


Seasonality
 Our business has tended to be seasonal with higher revenue in our third fiscal quarter as our customers typically increase their production to meet holiday shopping season or year-end demand for their products. Due to recent declines in demand for our solutions in several consumer camera markets, the seasonal impact was not significant in fiscal year 2019. We also may experience seasonally lower demand in our first fiscal quarter in the Asia-based portion of the IP security camera market as a result of industry seasonality and the impact of ODM and OEM factory closures associated with the Chinese New Year holiday. 
Employees 
 At January 31, 2019, we employed a total of 750 people, including 165 in the United States, 531 in Asia, primarily in China and Taiwan and 54 in Europe. We also engage temporary employees and consultants. None of our employees are either represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
