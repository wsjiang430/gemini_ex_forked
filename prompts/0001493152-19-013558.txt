Item 1. Description of Business.
Organization
 
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware as a for-profit company on March 2, 2015 and established a fiscal year end of December 31. On March 4, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Correction to the Certificate of Incorporation to correct our name to Hubilu Venture Corporation from Hubilu Venture Corp. On March 5, 2015, our incorporator adopted our bylaws and appointed our sole director. We were formed to provide consulting and advisory services to real estate professionals and investors to assist them in finding properties and evaluating them for purchase or leasing. We are not a real estate brokerage firm and do not engage in real estate brokerage activities.
 
Our services are focused on the research and analysis of real estate properties and advising clients on the best use of their real estate assets. On August 18, 2016 we established a real estate acquisitions’ division seeking to raise money and acquire real estate assets.
 
On March 5, 2015, we issued 25,000,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $0.001 per share, to our founder, David Behrend for $75,000 in cash or $0.003 per share. On April 30, 2015, Mr. Behrend transferred his shares to Jacaranda Investments, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, which he owns 100% of, in exchange for 30,000 shares of Jacaranda’s common shares. From April 7, 2015 to May 7, 2015, we sold and issued 235,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.10 per share for $23,500 to 40 accredited investors. On May 4, 2015, we issued 191,500 shares of our common stock, valued by our sole director at $0.10 per share, or $19,150, to 12 individuals for services rendered to us. Six of these individuals had already purchased shares of our common stock at the price of $0.10 per share. On October 1, 2016, we issued 100,000 shares to 5 individuals for share-based compensation, valued by our sole director at $0.10 per share, for compensation of $50,000 for services rendered to us by them. Presently, we estimate our monthly burn rate is approximately $12,000 per month, which consists of general and administrative expenses, consulting fees, professional fees, property taxes, rent, repairs and maintenance, transfer agent and filings fees and utilities. We believe that our revenues will cover our burn rate over the next 12 months. We believe that we may require approximately $50,000 in either cash or from sale of our common stock, preferred stock, convertible note debt, or advances from our majority shareholder, which has agreed to advance our working capital, if necessary, to accomplish the goals set out in our plan of operation, . We also intend to use our common stock to accomplish these goals to conserve our cash if we can negotiate the payment for services with our shares.
 
Our principal business, executive and registered statutory office is located at 205 South Beverly Drive, Suite 205, Beverly Hills, CA 90212 and our telephone number is (310) 308-7887 and email contact is info@hubilu.com. Our URL address is www.hubilu.com.

Business
 
We were formed as a real estate consulting and acquisition firm that commenced operations in March 5, 2015, and, until June 2015, was limited to organizational and business development activities. In June 2015, we entered into our first consulting agreement with a client. As a real estate advisory and consulting company, we assist real estate investor professionals, as well as established companies, with advisory and consulting services focused on providing research, analysis and acquisition opportunities to them. Our mission is to assist investors and professionals in the early stage analysis of market opportunities and the evaluation of properties prior to them committing capital for the purchase or the leasing of real estate properties. We are not real estate brokers and do not intend to offer brokerage services.
 
Commencing in June 2015, we engaged our first client, 112 South Eucalyptus Avenue, LLC, to assist it in evaluating the best use of its property.
 
Real Estate Acquisitions
 
On August 18, 2016, we launched a real estate acquisition division to acquire real estate for our company.
 
In 2017, we acquired 2 rental properties. See footnotes 4 & 5 to our audited financial statements.
 
On September 15, 2017, we hired Earn By SEO, which specializes in Search Engine Optimization and Social Media Optimization, to enhance our Hubilu.com website to drive traffic and expand our investor and social media presence. This company also assisted us with launching our student housing rental site, Hubiluhousing.com, which went live on March 16, 2018. This was a needed adjunct to assist with our aggressive marketing of rentals and also allow our students ease to locate and sign rental contracts, which is all online now.
 
On January 4, 2018, we started to accept Crypto currency as a form of rental payment for our properties.
 
On March 7, 2018, we contracted with Pacific Green Homes to install solar technology on our property located at 3711 S. Western Ave in Los Angeles. The solar panels were installed and became operational on May 26, 2018. This has reduced our electric operating costs, resulting in greater returns for our investors.
 
On May 31, 2018 we acquired Sunza Investments, LLC, and its real property asset located at 3910 Walton Street in Los Angeles. 


On September 27, 2018, through our subsidiary, Sunza Investments, LLC, we acquired a real property asset located at 3910 Wisconsin Ave in Los Angeles. 
 
On December 31, 2018, we acquired Lantana Investments, LLC, and its real property asset located at 1557 W. 29th Street in Los Angeles. 
 
Subsequent Events
 
On March 8, 2019 we entered into an agreement to acquire Kapok Investments, LLC, and its real property asset located at 1981 Estella Ave, Los Angeles. Purchase is scheduled to close in Q4, 2019.
 
On March 22, 2019 we entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of Elata Investments, LLC, and its real property asset located at 1267 W. 38th Street, Los Angeles. On July 12th, 2019, the acquisition was completed for $600,000. The terms of the Hubilu membership interest purchase was subject to two loans as follows:
 

● | A $415,000 first position note owing by Elata, whose terms of payments due were interest only, payable on unpaid principal at the rate of 5.50% per annum. Interest only payable in monthly installments of $1,902.08 or more on the 20th day of each month beginning on the 20th day of August, 2019 and continuing until the 19h day of March 2023, at which time the entire principal balance together with interest due thereon, shall become due and payable. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A $185,000 second position note owing by Elata, whose terms of payments due were interest only, payable on unpaid principal at the rate of 2.25% per annum. Interest only payable in monthly installments of $346.87 or more on the 20th day of each month beginning on the 20th day of August 2019 and continuing until the 19th day of March 2023, at which time the entire principal balance together with interest due thereon, shall become due and payable. 

Real Estate Consulting:
 
Market Opportunity
 
We believe the real estate consulting and advisory industries are sectors of the U.S. economy, which have seen increased activity since interest rates are at their current levels. We believe that an attractive opportunity exists for a public company focused on assisting real estate investors and users in evaluating real estate opportunities and we intend to provide services. We are focusing on the commercial and residential rental real estate market.
 
Historically, the U.S. real estate industry has tended to be cyclical. The real estate market experienced a significant downturn from the 2007 peak to a trough in 2009, representing the most severe downturn in property sales since at least 1990. Since 2009, real estate sales for transactions of $1 million and above have increased by 97% and dollar volume has increased by 235%. The Los Angeles housing market forecast for the 3 years ending in 2021 is positive according to LittleBigHomes.com which estimates that the rising housing market prices in Los Angeles is 6 % annually during this period. If the Housing Market forecast is correct, home values will be higher at the end of 2021 than at the end of 2018. This cyclical upturn has been, and we believe will continue to be, primarily driven by attractive yields, improving property fundamentals and the availability and cost of financing.
 
Attractive Yields. According to CBRE Research and Reports, average commercial real estate yields (capitalization rates) for the four major property types currently range from 2.00% to 7.00%, which compare equally to alternative investments such as stocks and bonds, while being secured by real assets. We believe these steady growth yields will continue to drive capital inflows for commercial and residential real estate investments.
 
Improving Property Fundamentals. Property median rents continue to improve in the Los Angeles multifamily property market, which finished in Q4 of 2018 at $ 1,898/unit, up 0.8% from Q4 of 2017, and has risen every quarter since Q2 2010. Reis forecasts Los Angeles to grow 4.3% during 2019. We expect further increases in occupancy and rental rates in all four primary commercial real estate sectors of multifamily, retail, office and industrial properties.

Availability and Cost of Financing. The availability and low cost of debt financing has been a significant contributor to the recent improvement in the U.S. capital markets and the U.S. commercial real estate market. Low interest rates and improved access to capital are key factors fueling investment sales activity.


We are focusing our business on the private client segment, as we believe it represents the largest and most active market segment in the commercial real estate investment industry. We believe private clients, many of whom are individuals and partnerships, are impacted by life or partnership changes that often override market and macroeconomic conditions. Due to these personal and partnership drivers, we believe properties in this segment exhibit a high turnover rate. We believe private clients often take advantage of rising prices to dispose of assets, refinance, acquire and/or exchange assets into new opportunities. The attractive financial results for property investment provide the opportunity for redeployment of capital, which supports a high number of sales transactions. Additionally, the private client segment is highly fragmented with many buyers, sellers and properties in different geographic regions and sectors.
 
We believe it is also the most underserved market segment and intend to offer our consulting services to private clients. We believe our competition will come from brokerage firms, consulting departments of accounting and consulting firms and other real estate advisory firms.
 
Our Business Strategy – Consulting
 

● | We intend to provide consulting and advisory services to our clients for fee-based compensation. We will negotiate our fees on a case-by-case basis and intend to offer hourly rates and flat fees for our services We intend to help provide our clients with the research and analysis to minimize their time to evaluate properties. We believe that our services will reduce time, costs and accelerate the time to enable the client to purchase or lease real estate without the pressure of commission sales professionals.

We believe that the services we offer to our future clients will be quality, value added services that will enable long term success for them and us.
 
We intend to derive income from our clients for the performance of these services. We also intend to acquire and operate additional residential rental properties and derive income from management fees and operating income.
 
Financing Strategy
 
Our ability to increase our revenues and market our services will dependent on additional outside financing, advances from our majority shareholder and reinvesting our profits. Primary responsibility for the overall planning and management of our services will rest with our management. For each service, we plan to offer, management will need to assess the market and our needs to offer such consulting or advisory services at cost-effective prices to real estate investors and users. All decisions will be subject to budgetary restrictions and our business control. We cannot provide any guarantee that we will be able to ever offer services on cost-effect terms.
Competition
 
The real estate advisory and consulting services industry is highly competitive. We compete with a variety of companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources than us, are subsidiaries or divisions of larger organizations. In particular, the industry is characterized by a small number of large, dominant organizations that perform this service, such as real estate brokerage firms, accounting firms, law firms, consultants as well as many companies that have greater financial and other resources than us.
 
The major competitive factors in our business are the timeliness and quality of service, the quality of work product the clients desire and price. Our ability to compete effectively in providing customer service and quality services depends primarily on the level of training of our future staff, the utilization of computer software and equipment and the ability to deliver our services in an effective and timely manner. We believe we will compete effectively in these areas.
 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, managerial, marketing and other resources than we do, and they may compete more effectively than we can. If our competitors offer services at lower prices than we do, we may have to lower the prices we charge, which will adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, many of our competitors can obtain more experienced employees than we can.
 
Real Estate Acquisitions/ Business Acquisitions:
 
Market Opportunity
 
Acquire Student housing properties adjacent to USC campus and other high-end universities which offer recession proof stability and top of the market value on rents.
 
Off Campus Student Housing began in the mid 1990’s as an infancy industry with high growth potential, with many real estate investors capitalizing on the premium rents and lack of housing on university campuses.
Why Student Housing is Growing:
 

o | Stable and Rising College Enrollment 
--+-----------------------------------------
o | Demand Exceeds Supply 
o | Students Desire Homelike Amenities 
o | Lower Off-Campus Housing Costs 
o | Capital Constraints on Universities 
o | Recession Proof Industry 
o | Premium Market Rents Year Round 

 
USC Students are using the four Metro Stations in walking distance of USC Campus to access Downtown Los Angeles, including Staples Center, LA Live, Nightlife Clubs and Bars, Entertainment Centers, Shopping Opportunities.
 
Average monthly rents of a unit in the USC area rose from approximately $750 in 2005 to $1,500 in 2018 and student enrollment at USC has grown from 32,000 in 2005 to 47,500 in 2018, with 27,500 being graduate students.

There are also opportunities to develop multi-family properties within walking distance of the newly constructed Los Angeles Metro/subway stations, taking advantage of upside density, zoning changes, and higher rents.
 

● | In addition to on-demand car service availability, tenants benefit by being near the LA Metro/subway stations, eliminating the need and costs for personal vehicles and parking. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Development opportunities will increase as the City encourages more density around the LA Metro/subway systems to help minimize vehicle congestion and pollution levels. 
● | Increased rents and development opportunities will result in higher values and a greater return on investment 
● | Acquisitions of profitable high growth businesses in the industries of Business Services (Property Management, Clean Tech (Green), Healthcare Services, I.T./Cloud) and e-Commerce (B2B, B2C) operating in Southern California. 

 
In addition to investing in real estate, we intend to diversify our investment portfolio and expand our revenue sources to include the acquisitions of profitable high growth businesses to increase our cash flow, including Property Management, CleanTech (Green), Healthcare, Intelligent Technology/Cloud, and e-Commerce (B2B, B2C).
 
Our Business Strategy 
 

● | Seek out and acquire Real Estate which management believes has limited downside risk, is recession proof, and is in the path of growth to facilitate high rental income upside and equity appreciation. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Purchase single family and multi-family properties and portfolios, either at discounted prices or which require cosmetic renovations, to maximize cash flow and equity appreciation in the shortest possible time. 
● | Undertake development projects that involve material construction and/or renovations to realize the highest and best use upside value with significant long term investment returns. 
● | Acquire business opportunities that bring in high cash flow, with low risk, that expands our portfolio, offset our current and expanding operating costs, and allow us to grow our real estate acquisition division. 
● | Focus on below-market or other non-listed opportunities 
● | Our goal is to acquire 10 properties over the next 12 months 

Financing Strategy 
 
Our ability to increase our revenues, net profit and cash flow will dependent on our ability to acquire more properties, additional bank and outside financing, advances from our majority shareholder and reinvesting our profits. Primary responsibility for the overall planning and management of our services will rest with our management. For each acquisition, management will need to assess the market and the ability to make a profit from rental income less expenses and cost of capital of the potential acquisitions.
Competition
 
The real estate student housing acquisition and rental industry is highly competitive. We compete with a variety of individuals and companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources than us or are subsidiaries or divisions of larger organizations. In particular, the industry is characterized by a small number of large, dominant organizations that perform this service.
 
The major competitive factors in our business is our ability to compete effectively in providing students, quality housing at an affordable price, maintaining properties in excellent condition and obtaining market rents from tenants. We believe we will compete effectively in these areas.
 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, managerial, marketing and other resources than we do, and they may compete more effectively than we can. If our competitors offer services at lower rental prices than we do, we may have to lower the prices we charge, which will adversely affect our results of operations.

Hubilu Venture Corporation (“the Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on March 2, 2015 and is a publicly traded real estate consulting, asset management and business acquisition company, which specializes in acquiring student housing income properties and development/business opportunities located near within the Los Angeles area.
NOTE 2 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN


The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and each of its wholly owned subsidiaries: Akebia Investments LLC, Zinnia Investments, LLC, Sunza Investments, LLC and Lantana Investments LLC. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. 
 
The financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern, which assumes that the Company will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for the next year. Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these financial statements do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and classification of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. At December 31, 2018, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations, had an accumulated deficit of $913,315 since inception and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of which casts substantial doubt upon the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, that it may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
 
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. Management intends to focus on raising additional funds either by way of debt or equity issuances in order to continue operations. The Company cannot provide any assurance or guarantee that it will be able to obtain additional financing or generate revenues sufficient to maintain operations.
 
NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. These estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment, after considering past, current and expected events and economic conditions. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition
 
Management has determined that all of the Company’s leases with its various tenants are operating leases. Rental income is generally recognized based on the terms of leases entered into with tenants. In those instances, in which the Company funds tenant improvements and the improvements are deemed to be owned by the Company, revenue recognition will commence when the improvements are substantially completed, and possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant.
Real Estate
 
Land, buildings and improvements are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life ranging generally from 27 years to a maximum of 30 years on buildings and major improvements. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the related assets are charged to operations as incurred. Tenant improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the related lease or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter.
 
The Company’s methodology of allocating the cost of acquisitions to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on estimated fair values, replacement cost and/or appraised values. When the Company acquires operating real estate properties, the purchase price is allocated to land, building, improvements, leasing costs, intangibles such as in-place leases, assumed debt, if any, and to current assets and liabilities acquired, if any. The value allocated to in-place leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the consolidated statements of operations.

When the Company acquires a property, it allocates the aggregate purchase price to tangible assets, consisting of land, building, site improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets component at the time of purchase. The Company follows the guidance as outlined in ASC 805-10, Business Combinations, as amended by ASU 2017-01. As described below in the section entitled New Accounting Pronouncements, Accounting Standards Update 2017-01 was adopted by the Company effective January 1, 2017, which changed the definition of a business. Under this new guidance most property acquisitions made by the Company will fall within the category of acquired assets rather than acquired businesses. This distinction will cause the Company to capitalize its costs for acquisitions, allocate them to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities and amortize these costs over the remaining useful lives of those assets and liabilities. Should the Company complete any acquisitions in the future which qualify as acquisitions of businesses, associated acquisition costs would be expensed as incurred.
 
Asset Impairment
 
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to aggregate future net cash flows (undiscounted and without interest) expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value. Management does not believe that the value of any of the Company’s real estate investments was impaired at December 31, 2018.
Loss per Share
 
The Company’s basic loss per share are calculated by dividing its net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The Company’s dilutive loss per share is calculated by dividing its net loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity.
Income Taxes
 
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the income tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is applied against any deferred tax asset if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. For uncertain tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold, the Company recognizes the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the consolidated financial statements. The Company’s practice is to recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-1, “Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business.” The pronouncement changes the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. The pronouncement requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets; if so, the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-1 effective April 1, 2017. In respect of the Company’s acquisition of Sunza Investments LLC and Lantana Investments LLC in 2018, it was concluded substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired with each property acquisition was concentrated in a single identifiable asset and did not meet the definition of a business.


In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers-Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard until the first quarter of 2018. Subsequently, the FASB has issued multiple ASUs clarifying ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2015-14. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. Revenue is generally recognized net of allowances and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. The majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from rental income, which is scoped out from this standard and will be accounted for under ASU 2016-02, Leases. The Company’s other revenue streams, which are being evaluated under this ASU, include but are not limited to management fees, non-recurring rental and non-rental related income and gains and losses from real estate dispositions. The Company adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach, applying the provisions to open contracts as of the date of adoption. There was no material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements on the adoption of ASU 2014-09.
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, amending the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. The guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019 and allows for early adoption. The new standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. ASU 2016-02 provides for transition relief, which includes not electing to (i) reassess whether any expired or existing contract is a lease or contains a lease, (ii) reassess the lease classification of any expired or existing leases and (iii) expense any capitalized initial direct costs for any existing leases. The Company will continue to assess the impact of the new standard.

NOTE 10–SERIES 1 CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES
 
The Company has authorized and designated 2,000,000 shares of Series 1 convertible preferred stock (the “Preferred Stock”).

(Notes 4 and 5). In January 2018, the Company issued 20,000 shares of Preferred Stock at an issuance price of $1per share, for proceeds of $20,000. In March 2018, the Company issued 20,000 shares of Preferred Stock at an issuance price of $1.00 per share, for gross proceeds of $20,000.
 
The Preferred Stock has the following rights and privileges:

Change – Each share of Preferred Stock, is convertible at the option of the holder, into shares of common stock, at the lesser of $0.50 per share or a ten percent (10%) discount to the average closing bid price of the common stock 5 days prior to the notice of conversion. The Preferred Stock is also subject to certain adjustments for dilution, if any, resulting from future stock issuances, including for any subsequent issuance of common stock at a price per share less than that paid by the holders of the Preferred Stock.
 
Dividends – The holders of the Preferred Stock in preference to the holders of common stock, are entitled to receive, if and when declared by the Board of Directors, dividends at the rate of 5% per annum, in kind, which shall accrue quarterly.

NOTE 11–INCOME TAXES
 
The Company did not record a provision for income taxes for the years ended December 2018 and 2017 due to a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
 
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act) was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact the Company, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 34% to 21%, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act also provides for the implementation of a territorial tax system, a one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings, the acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27, 2017 and other prospective changes beginning in 2018, including repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction, acceleration of tax revenue recognition, capitalization of research and development expenditures, additional limitations on executive compensation and limitations on the deductibility of interest.
 
Pursuant to the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company has not finalized its accounting for the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act. This includes a provisional amount related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21% plus the applicable state tax rate, with a corresponding change to the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017. The impact of the 2017 Tax Act may differ from this estimate during the ensuing fiscal year due to, among other things, further refinement of the Company’s calculation, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, additional guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of the 2017 Tax Act.


The difference between the provision for income taxes and income taxes computed using the effective U.S. federal statutory rate is as follows:
 

 | December 31, 2018 | | | December 31, 2017 | 
------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+---------+---+-----------------------+--
Expected tax recovery at the statutory rate | $ | (88,000 | ) | | $ | (75,000 | )
Impact of the 2017 Tax Act | | - | | | | 73,000 | 
Non-deductible items | | 41,000 | | | | - | 
Adjustment of the prior year tax provision | | - | | | | (11,000 | )
Change in valuation allowance | | 47,000 | | | | 13,000 | 
Provision for income taxes | $ | - | | | $ | - | 



Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets are as follows:
 

 | December 31, 2018 | | | December 31, 2017 | 
----------------------------------+-----------------------+----------+---+-----------------------+--
Net operating loss carry-forwards | $ | 164,000 | | | $ | 117,000 | 
Valuation allowance | | (164,000 | ) | | | (117,000 | )
 | $ | - | | | $ | - | 

 
At December 31, 2018, the Company has accumulated net operating losses totaling approximately $782,000 which may be available to carry forward and offset future years’ taxable income.
 
Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient future taxable income during the period that deductible temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be available to reduce taxable income. As the achievement of required future taxable income is uncertain, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset.
