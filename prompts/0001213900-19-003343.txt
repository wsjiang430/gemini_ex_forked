Except where the context otherwise requires, all references in this Annual Report to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar words or phrases are to One Madison Corporation, a Cayman Islands exempted company. References to our “management” or our “management team” refer to our executive officers and directors, and references to the “Sponsor” refer to One Madison Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in which our founder, Omar M. Asali, together with certain affiliates, holds a controlling 80% ownership interest. References to our “initial shareholders” refer to the Sponsor, the Anchor Investors (as defined below), the BSOF Entities (as defined below) and the Company’s management.
 
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on July 13, 2017 as a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
Business Combination
 
Stock Purchase Agreement
 
On December 12, 2018, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Rack Holdings L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“Seller”), and Rack Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Seller (“Rack Holdings”), collectively known as “Ranpak,” pursuant to which the Company will acquire all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Rack Holdings from Seller, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. The transactions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement will result in a “Business Combination” involving the Company for purposes of the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association. The Stock Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.
 
Ranpak is the global leader in fiber-based, environmentally sustainable protective packaging solutions that safeguard products in commerce and industrial supply chains. Ranpak, founded in 1972, is headquartered in Concord Township, Ohio and has approximately 550 employees.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to pay to Seller at the closing of the Business Combination (“Closing”) $950,000,000 in cash in consideration for the acquisition of Rack Holdings, which amount will be (i) adjusted by the difference between the net working capital of Rack Holdings and its subsidiaries as of Closing as measured against normalized level of working capital of $22,000,000 (which could be a downward or upward adjustment), (ii) increased by the amount of cash of Rack Holdings and its subsidiaries as of Closing and (iii) reduced by the amount of debt and unpaid transaction expenses of Rack Holdings and its subsidiaries as of Closing. The purchase price paid at Closing will be based on an estimate of the amount of the foregoing adjustments and will be subject to a customary post-Closing true-up. On January 24, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement Amendment”) with Seller and Rack Holdings, pursuant to which, the closing cash consideration is payable in immediately available funds as follows: (x) €140,000,000 in Euros (which payment shall be credited against the closing cash consideration in an amount equal to $160,825,000 (the “Euro payment credit”) based on an agreed currency exchange ratio of 1.00:1.14875 EUR:USD) and (y) an amount in U.S. dollars equal to the closing cash consideration less the Euro payment credit.

Financing for the Business Combination and for related transaction expenses is expected to consist of (i) $300,000,000 of proceeds from the Company’s Initial Public Offering on deposit in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) (plus any interest income accrued thereon since the Initial Public Offering), net of any redemptions of the Company’s ordinary shares in connection with the shareholder vote to be held in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement, (ii) $150,000,000 of proceeds from the forward purchase agreements entered into in connection with the Initial Public Offering, (iii) $142,000,000 of proceeds from subscription agreements entered into on December 12, 2018 in connection with the Business Combination and (iv) up to $650,000,000 of senior secured credit facilities provided by Goldman Sachs Merchant Banking Division.
 
The Closing is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including approval by the Company’s shareholders of the additional equity issuances relating to the equity financing, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the German Act Against Restraints on Competition, the accuracy of the parties’ respective representations and warranties and compliance with the parties’ respective covenant obligations (each to certain specified materiality standards), and the absence of a “Material Adverse Effect” on Rack Holdings and its subsidiaries.
 
The Stock Purchase Agreement contains customary termination rights, including (i) by mutual written consent of the parties; (ii) by either party if (a) the Closing has not occurred on or prior to July 12, 2019, unless such party’s failure to comply in all material respects with the covenants and agreements contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement causes the failure of the Business Combination to be consummated by such time, (b) the consummation of the Business Combination is permanently enjoined or prohibited by the terms of a final, non-appealable governmental order or a statute, rule or regulation, (c) the representations, warranties or covenants of the other party are breached such that there is a failure of the related closing condition (subject to a 30-day cure period) or (d) the Company does not obtain the approval of its shareholders upon a vote taken thereon at the Company shareholder meeting; and (iii) by Seller if (a) the Company’s Board of Directors withdraws its recommendation that shareholders approve the transaction, (b) the Company shareholder approval is not obtained at the Company’s first call of its shareholder meeting or (c) the Company fails to consummate the Business Combination on the 10th business day following the satisfaction or waiver of the last condition to closing (subject to a further 10-business-day cure period).
 
Consent of Forward Contract Parties
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement, One Madison entered into a consent (the “FPA Consent”) with parties to the Forward Purchase Agreements, dated October 5, 2017 and amended on December 15, 2017 and in some cases, January 5, 2018, (in each case as amended, the “Forward Purchase Agreements” or “FPAs”) that have committed to purchase substantially all of the forward purchase shares pursuant to which, among other things, the consenting FPA parties consented to the entry into the Stock Purchase Agreement.
Debt Financing
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into a debt commitment letter (the “Debt Commitment Letter”) with Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC and certain affiliated investment entities thereof (collectively, the “Lenders”), pursuant to which the Lenders have committed to provide senior secured credit facilities subject to the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. The aggregate commitment consists of a $450,000,000 First Lien Term Facility, a $45,000,000 Revolving Facility, a $100,000,000 First Lien Contingency Term Facility and a $100,000,000 Second Lien Contingency Term Facility. The Company has the ability to bring in additional revolving lenders to provide up to $30,000,000 additional commitments under the Revolving Facility within fifteen (15) business days after the date of the Debt Commitment Letter. The obligations of the Lenders to provide debt financing under the Debt Commitment Letter are subject to a number of conditions.
Voting Agreement
 
On December 7, 2018, in connection with the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company and the BSOF Entities entered into an Amended and Restated Voting Agreement (the “Voting Agreement”), pursuant to which the BSOF Entities, holders of 4,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Shares”), agree to vote any Class A Shares they hold in favor of any shareholder approvals sought by the Company in connection with the Business Combination and not to exercise any right of redemption in respect of such Class A Shares.

The Voting Agreement requires the BSOF Entities to obtain prior written consent of the Company before transferring any Class A Shares prior to the termination of the Voting Agreement. The Voting Agreement will automatically terminate upon the first to occur of (i) the completion of the Business Combination, (ii) the termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement and (iii) prior to the completion of the Business Combination by the mutual written consent of the Company and the BSOF Entities.
 
Working Capital Promissory Note
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement, One Madison issued a $4,000,000 Global Promissory Note (the “Working Capital Promissory Note”) to certain of the sources of equity financing for the Business Combination under the Forward Purchase Agreements and the Subscription Agreements in exchange for $4,000,000 of financing to be used for the payment of working capital expenses, including expenses incurred in connection with the Business Combination. The note is non-interest bearing, unsecured and due on the earliest of (i) the Closing of the Business Combination, (ii) 30 days after the date on which the Stock Purchase Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and (iii) September 12, 2019. The Company intends to repay the Note from the proceeds of the equity financing provided pursuant to the Subscription Agreements.
Subscription Agreements
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement, One Madison entered into subscription agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) with certain equity financing sources (the “Subscribing Parties”) for the purchase and sale of 14,200,000 shares of the Company’s Class A Shares or Class C ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, (the “Class C Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $142,000,000. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreements will occur immediately prior to the completion of the Business Combination. The funding of such amounts is subject to customary conditions, including the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Closing set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. The Subscription Agreements automatically terminate upon the termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement or upon the mutual written consent of the Company and the Subscribing Parties.
 
FPA Assignment and Assumption Agreement
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Mr. Asali (the “Assignor”) entered into the FPA assignment and assumption (the “FPA Assignment and Assumption Agreement”) agreement with Gerard Griffin, a Managing Director of the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Assignor, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, (i) assigned to Mr. Griffin the right and obligation to acquire 350,000 Class A Shares and 116,677 warrants to purchase Class A Shares under the terms of the Assignor’s Forward Purchase Agreement and (ii) sold to Mr. Griffin 87,500 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, (the “Class B Shares”) at the same price per share at which the Assignor purchased such Class B Shares from the Company. The assignment contemplated by the FPA Assignment and Assumption Agreement does not relieve the Assignor of his obligations with respect to the portion of the Forward Purchase Agreement commitment assigned thereunder. Mr. Griffin agreed to waive any Claim (as defined in the Forward Purchase Agreement) in or to any distributions by the Company from the Trust Account and agreed not to seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever. Finally, Mr. Griffin acknowledged and agreed to the transfer restrictions on the Class B Shares under the FPA pursuant to which the Assignor acquired the Class B Shares from the Company.
 
Reallocation Agreement
 
On November 12, 2018, subsequently amended concurrently with the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into a reallocation agreement (the “Reallocation Agreement”) with the parties to the Forward Purchase Agreements for the Business Combination under the Forward Purchase Agreements and the Subscription Agreements, pursuant to which the Class B Shares issued and the rights to acquire warrants to purchase Class A Shares arising under the Forward Purchase Agreements have been reallocated among all equity financing sources, including two new equity sources, one of whom is a related party, on a pro rata basis on the aggregate amount of equity financing provided by such equity financing source under the Forward Purchase Agreements and the Subscription Agreements. The reallocation was effective as of the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement.

Class B Share Consent
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement, shareholders holding more than two-thirds of the Company’s Class B Shares entered into a consent (the “Class B Share Consent”) pursuant to which such shareholders, on behalf of themselves and all other holders of Class B Shares, waived the anti-dilution protection benefiting the Class B Shares under the terms of the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (“Charter”) with respect to (i) the Class A Shares and Class C Shares to be issued pursuant to the Subscription Agreements and (ii) any Class A Shares or Class C Shares to be issued by the Company in connection with the exchange of any of the Company’s outstanding private placement warrants. As such, assuming no other equity securities are issued in connection with the Business Combination and assuming no redemption of Class A Shares by the Company’s shareholders, on the business day following the consummation of the Business Combination, each Class B Share will convert into one Class A Share or Class C Share as applicable.
 
For the full text of the Stock Purchase Agreement and related agreements, see the Exhibits to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 13, 2018.
 
Other than as specifically discussed, this Annual Report does not assume the closing of the Business Combination.
 
Aside from activities related to the pending Business Combination, we have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date, other than interest earned from proceeds of the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
 
Initial Public Offering
 
On January 22, 2018, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 30,000,000 units (the “units”). Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds, before expenses, of $300,000,000. Prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased 8,625,000 Class B Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share, and the Company’s founder, Omar M. Asali, along with certain other investors, including the Company’s executive officers, (collectively the “Anchor Investors”) purchased 3,750,000 Class B Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $37,500, or approximately $0.01 per share (together, the “Founder Shares”). The Founder Shares were issued to the Anchor Investors in connection with their agreement to purchase an aggregate of 15,000,000 ordinary shares (13,025,000 Class A Shares and 1,975,000 Class C Shares) (“Forward Purchase Shares”), plus an aggregate of 5,000,000 redeemable warrants (“Forward Purchase Warrants”) for $10.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $150,000,000, in a private placement to occur concurrently with the closing of the Initial Business Combination. The Company also entered into a Strategic Partnership Agreement (the “Strategic Partnership Agreement), pursuant to which the Sponsor transferred 525,000 Founder Shares to BSOF Master Fund L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, and BSOF Master Fund II L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, both affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (together, the “BSOF Entities”).
 
In January 2018, the Sponsor transferred 240,000 Founder Shares to the Company’s independent directors at their original purchase price. Subsequently, 60,000 of the 240,000 Founder Shares were forfeited back to the Sponsor due to the resignation of one of the Company’s directors in May 2018. In March 2018, following the expiration of the underwriters’ over-allotment option granted in the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor surrendered 1,125,000 Class B Shares to the Company for no consideration, which the Company cancelled. In October 2018, the Sponsor sold 100,000 Founder Shares to the Company’s Chief Financial Officer and 423,000 Founder Shares to certain employees of the Sponsor for total consideration of $3,138, or $0.006 per share. As of December 31, 2018, the Sponsor owned 6,272,000 Class B Shares.

Upon execution of the Forward Purchase Agreements, each Anchor Investor elected to receive a fixed number of Class A Shares or Class C Shares. The Class C Shares have identical terms as the Class A Shares, except that the Class C Shares do not grant their holders any voting rights. Our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that, following the consummation of our Initial Business Combination, the Class C Shares may be converted into Class A Shares on a one-for-one basis at the election of the holder with 65 days’ written notice or upon the transfer of such Class C ordinary share to a non-affiliate of the holder.
 
Pursuant to the Strategic Partnership Agreement, the BSOF Entities have agreed to act as our strategic partner and may provide debt or equity financing in connection with our Initial Business Combination but are not required to do so. The Founder Shares held by the BSOF Entities are subject to certain transfer restrictions, forfeiture and earnout provisions similar to those imposed upon our Sponsor and the Anchor Investors. The BSOF Entities have agreed to vote any Founder Shares they may own in favor of such Initial Business Combination. If we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, the BSOF Entities are entitled to designate one observer to our board of directors until the consummation of our Initial Business Combination. The BSOF Entities have also separately purchased an aggregate of 560,000 Private Placement Warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, in the Initial Private Placement. Such Private Placement Warrants have the same terms and conditions as those purchased by our Anchor Investors. The BSOF Entities will be entitled to registration rights with respect any ordinary shares and warrants held by them. We believe that the combination of capital provided by our Anchor Investors and a strategic partnership with the BSOF Entities will provide us with a material advantage in effecting an Initial Business Combination.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Anchor Investors, Vivoli Holdings LLC, an entity beneficially owned by Mr. Asali, and BSOF Entities purchased an aggregate of 8,000,000 warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per warrant, generating $8,000,000 in gross proceeds. Each whole Private Placement Warrant is for one whole share of the Company’s Class A ordinary share or one whole Class C ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share.
 
Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Initial Private Placement, $300,000,000 ($10.00 per unit) from the net proceeds thereof was placed in a U.S.-based Trust Account at Morgan Stanley & Co., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee, and is invested in a money market fund selected by the Company until the earlier of: (i) the completion of the Initial Business Combination or (ii) the redemption of the Company’s public shares if the Company is unable to complete a business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, subject to applicable law.
 
After the payment of underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion of $10,500,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions, which amount will be payable upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination if consummated) and approximately $1,000,000 in expenses relating to the Initial Public Offering, approximately $1,000,000 of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and Initial Private Placement was not deposited into the Trust Account and was retained by us for working capital purposes. The net proceeds deposited into the Trust Account remain on deposit in the Trust Account earning interest.

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following our initial public offering until the closing of the Initial Business Combination. We intend to effectuate our Initial Business Combination using a combination of the cash held in the Trust Account, our equity and debt as the consideration to be paid in our Initial Business Combination. We may seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our Initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of our Class A Shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our Initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
Selection of a target business and structuring of our Initial Business Combination
 
While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or location, we intend to focus on the consumer sector and consumer-related businesses based predominantly in North America with global reach. We believe our management team has the skills and experience to identify, evaluate and consummate a business combination and is positioned to assist businesses we acquire in the following categories: (i) consumer products or services, (ii) food and beverage and (iii) adjacent manufacturing or industrial services businesses linked to a consumer end-user. We intend to target businesses that have stable cash flows, strong management teams, and attractive growth prospects over the long term. Our management and our operating and advisory committee have extensive experience in not only identifying and executing the acquisition of private and public companies, but also in the running and operating of businesses post-transaction.
 
Our Initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our Initial Business Combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.
 
We anticipate structuring our Initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our Initial Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our Initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.
 
The time required to evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our Initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Redemption rights for holders of public shares upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A Shares sold as part of the units sold in the Initial Public Offering (the “public shares”) upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, calculated as of two (2) business days prior to the consummation of our Initial Business Combination, including interest, less income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination with respect to our warrants. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares, and with respect to the initial shareholders other than the Anchor Investors, any public shares they may hold in connection with the consummation of the Initial Business Combination.
 
Conduct of redemptions pursuant to tender offer rules
 
If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our Initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the Initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
 
Submission of our Initial Business Combination to a shareholder vote
 
In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the Initial Business Combination.
 
If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our Initial Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and any public shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of our Initial Business Combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares, and with respect to the initial shareholders other than the Anchor Investors, any public shares they may hold in connection with the consummation of the business combination.

If we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our Initial Business Combination. However, other than as expressly stated herein, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
 
The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our Initial Business Combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A Shares or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
Limitation on redemption rights upon completion of our Initial Business Combination if we seek stockholder approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering. We believe the restriction described above will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem to no more than 20% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those shareholders that hold more than 20% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering) for or against our business combination.

Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
 
The Sponsor, the Anchor Investors, our management and the BSOF Entities have agreed that we will have 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to complete our Initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months of closing of the Initial Public Offering, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten (10) business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months of closing of the Initial Public Offering.

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our Initial Business Combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our Initial Business Combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an Initial Business Combination.
Employees
 
We currently have two executive officers and no other employees. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Initial Business Combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Initial Business Combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in.
