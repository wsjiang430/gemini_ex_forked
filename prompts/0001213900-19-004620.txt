Overview
 
We are developing innovative technologies to increase the capacity and reduce the cost of storing electrical energy. We have previously developed an innovative material technology to reduce the cost per watt of electricity produced by Photovoltaic, or PV, solar modules.
 
We are currently working on a silicon anode additive material technology intended to increase the storage capacity of current and future generation of lithium-ion batteries while lowering the cost of storing electrical energy. The lower cost of electrical energy storage will result in reduced cost per watt of electricity produced by PV solar modules as well.
 
Industry Overview
 
The solar industry relies on two distinctly different solar energy technologies. Solar energy can be converted directly into electricity using PV devices or into heat by solar thermal devices. PV devices convert sunlight directly into electricity through a photovoltaic cell, commonly called a solar cell, a non-mechanical device usually made from silicon alloys. Solar thermal devices, on the other hand, are typically used for directly heating swimming pools, heating water for domestic use, and space heating of buildings.
 
Our product development focus had been based on PV technology, thus we are currently a part of the PV segment of the industry. Photovoltaics is derived from the words photo, meaning light, and voltaic, meaning voltage producing. Sunlight, not heat, fuels photovoltaic cells. The cells, made mostly of the semiconductor silicon, convert sunlight directly into electricity.
 
With all of these PV panels being installed, there is still one major challenge that prevents solar from being a primary and reliable source of power – the sun does not shine at night. As a result, solar users will switch to using electricity from the local power company during the evening hours. This switch causes sudden spikes in power demand on the grid and creates havoc at the local power company because the grid is not designed to respond to rapid demand changes. The key to solving this problem is efficient electrical energy storage systems that can be charged and discharged rapidly, day in and day out. This will time-shift daytime solar energy for nighttime use with minimal reliance on the power grid.
 
According to a 2015 report by Solar Energy Industries Association, the demand for rooftop solar paired with energy storage systems will reach $1 billion in the U.S. by 2020, and will create pent up demand for cost effective solar energy storage solutions. Pairing solar panels with batteries means users can store power during the day and use it at night, reducing electricity bills. Those savings can be more significant for customers who pay higher rates for electricity during peak periods.
 
With a modern world running on electricity, the need for battery storage has never been greater. The ability to store energy, take it on the go, and use it later, has opened up a new world of “Killer Apps” such as long range electric vehicles, iPhones, and storage of renewable wind and solar energy for later use. The key to enabling these Killer Apps is better and lower cost batteries.
 
According to a 2014 report from Lux Research, the global energy storage market will rise to $50 billion by the year 2020, with a compound annual growth rate of 8%. Much of the growth will be in electric vehicles, which will rise to $21 billion, followed by the incumbent consumer electronics segment such as iPhones, which will rise to $27 billion, with the remainder of $2.8 billion in stationary applications such as solar, back-up power, and grid storage.

Research and Development
 
We previously developed robust bio-based components that meet the stringent thermal and durability requirements of current PV module manufacturing processes. We identified certain bio-based materials that are inherently durable, and we then applied proprietary material processes to enhance the desirable characteristics of these bio-based materials – turning them into robust and durable materials to be used as solar panel components.  Based on long term environmental testing performed by the Company, we believe our BioBacksheetR is more durable than conventional petroleum based back sheets available in the market today.
 
The BioBacksheetR successfully obtained Underwriters Laboratories’ (UL) material certification in February 2011.  This version of our back sheet is designed for conventional c-Si solar modules, which currently represents over 75 percent of solar modules produced in the world, as well as for certain thin film solar modules.  The relative thermal index (RTI) rating of 130° C by UL was issued during the 3rd quarter of 2012, and a number of PV panel manufacturers obtained certifications on their PV panels incorporating BioBacksheetR for UL/IEC.  
 
A key ingredient of BioBacksheetR is Nylon 11 derived from castor bean oil. We do not currently have an agreement with Arkema, Inc, a global producer of high performance materials including Nylon 11, for the supply of Nylon 11 and there is currently no other known supplier of Nylon 11. If Nylon 11 becomes unavailable in the future, alternative materials such as Nylon 1010 or Nylon 12 can be substituted, for which there are many known suppliers. The Company currently does not manufacture BioBacksheetR, but the product is available for licensing.
 
We initially focused our energy storage development effort on high capacity cathode materials since most of today’s Li-ion batteries are “cathode limited.” With the goal of creating the company’s next generation super battery technology, we are currently investigating high capacity anode materials recognizing the fact that the overall battery capacity is determined by a combination of both cathode and anode. 
 
Silicon (Si) is one of the most promising anode materials being considered for next generation, high energy and high power lithium ion batteries (Li-Bs). However, Si anodes suffer from large capacity fading and tremendous volume changes during lithium-ion charge-discharge cycling. The strains due to the huge volume changes actually pulverizes the Si material and eventually lead to electrode shattering and delamination, which adversely affect the battery performance and cycle life. These are the primary challenges to the commercial use of Si for battery anodes, which the Company intends to overcome.
 
We previously sponsored a research program at the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University to strengthen the engineering development efforts of its battery technology. Dr. Sung-Jin Cho, Assistant Professor in the Nanoengineering Department at the university, was the lead investigator of the sponsored research program. Dr. Sungjin Cho is currently the technology advisor to BioSolar’s battery technology development program.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
We will begin marketing our energy storage component material technology as soon as demonstration prototypes become available. Our marketing plan includes engaging with large Lithium-ion battery manufacturers, as well as identifying potential licensing partners in the following industries: electric vehicles, consumer electronics and grid electrical storage.
 
We are currently outsourcing our promotion efforts to a public relations firm that is assisting us with comprehensive advertising and promotion of the Company and its silicon additive technology.
 
Backlog of Orders
 
We do not have any backlog of orders.

Government Contracts
 
We do not have any government contracts at this time.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. To date, our compliance with these regulations has had no material effect on our operations, capital, earnings, or competitive position, and the cost of such compliance has not been material. We are unable to assess or predict at this time what effect additional regulations or legislation could have on our activities.
Manufacturing and Distribution
 
We currently do not have any mechanism for the manufacture and distribution of our BioBacksheetR, nor do we have adequate financing to undertake these efforts on our own. BioBacksheetR is currently available for licensing.
 
Intellectual Property
 
On May 19, 2011, we filed a U.S. patent to protect the intellectual property rights for “Photovoltaic Module Backsheet, Materials for Use in Module Backsheet and Process for Making the Same,” application number 13/093,549.  The inventor listed on the patent application is Stanley Levy, our Chief Technology Officer.  The Company is listed as assignee. This patent was issued on July 14, 2015.
 
On March 26, 2018, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University filed a U.S. patent application U.S. Serial No. 62/473,772 titled “Prelithiated Silicon Particles for Lithium Ion Batteries”, and we signed an Exclusive License Agreement for the use of the technology effective September 25, 2017.
 
We rely upon confidentiality agreements signed by our employees, consultants and third parties to protect our intellectual property.
 
Competition
 
There are a number of companies manufacturing lithium-ion batteries including: Panasonic, Samsung, LG Chem, and Tesla. We plan to seek licensing arrangements for our lithium-ion battery technology with a select group of companies such as the ones listed above, and do not expect to be their direct competition.
