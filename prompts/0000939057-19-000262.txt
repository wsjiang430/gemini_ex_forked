Item 1.  Business
General
 
Riverview Bancorp, Inc., a Washington corporation, is the savings and loan holding company of Riverview Community Bank (the "Bank"). At March 31, 2019, the Company had total assets of $1.2 billion, total deposits of $925.1 million and shareholders' equity of $133.1 million. The Company's executive offices are located in Vancouver, Washington. The Bank's subsidiary, Riverview Trust Company (the "Trust Company"), is a trust and financial services company located in downtown Vancouver, Washington, and provides full-service brokerage activities, trust and asset management services.
 
The Company is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Systems ("Federal Reserve"). Substantially all of the Company's business is conducted through the Bank which is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), its primary regulator, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), the insurer of its deposits. The Bank's deposits are insured by the FDIC up to applicable legal limits under the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF"). The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLB") which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System ("FHLB System").
 
As a progressive, community-oriented financial services company, the Company emphasizes local, personal service to residents of its primary market area. The Company considers Clark, Klickitat and Skamania counties of Washington, and Multnomah, Washington and Marion counties of Oregon as its primary market area. The Company is engaged predominantly in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and using such funds in its primary market area to originate commercial business, commercial real estate, multi-family real estate, land, real estate construction, residential real estate and other consumer loans. The Company's loans receivable, net, totaled $864.7 million at March 31, 2019 compared to $800.6 million a year ago.
 
The Company's strategic plan includes targeting the commercial banking customer base in its primary market area for loan originations and deposit growth, specifically small and medium size businesses, professionals and wealth building individuals. In pursuit of these goals, the Company will seek to increase the loan portfolio consistent with its strategic plan and asset/liability and regulatory capital objectives, which includes maintaining a significant amount of commercial business and commercial real estate loans in its loan portfolio. Significant portions of our new loan originations – which are mainly concentrated in commercial business and commercial real estate loans – carry adjustable rates, higher yields or shorter terms and higher credit risk than traditional fixed-rate consumer real estate one-to-four family mortgages.
 
Our strategic plan also stresses increased emphasis on non-interest income, including increased fees for asset management through the Trust Company and deposit service charges. The strategic plan is designed to enhance earnings, reduce interest rate risk and provide a more complete range of financial services to customers and the local communities the Company serves. We believe we are well positioned to attract new customers and to increase our market share through our 18 branches, including, among others, ten in Clark County, four in the Portland metropolitan area and three lending centers.
 
On February 17, 2017, the Company completed the purchase and assumption transaction in which the Company purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of MBank, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Merchants Bancorp, including $115.3 million in loans and $130.6 million of deposits (the "MBank transaction"). In addition, as part of the MBank transaction, Riverview Bancorp, Inc. assumed the obligations of Merchant Bancorp's trust preferred securities.

Market Area
 
The Company conducts operations from its home office in Vancouver, Washington and 18 branch offices located in Camas, Washougal, Stevenson, White Salmon, Battle Ground, Goldendale, and Vancouver, Washington (seven branch offices) and Portland (two branch offices), Gresham, Tualatin and Aumsville, Oregon. The Trust Company has two locations, one in downtown Vancouver, Washington and one in Lake Oswego, Oregon, and provides full-service brokerage activities, trust and asset management services. Riverview Mortgage, a mortgage broker division of the Bank, originates mortgage loans for various mortgage companies predominantly in the Vancouver/Portland metropolitan areas, as well as for the Bank. The Bank's Business and Professional Banking Division, with two lending offices located in Vancouver and one in Portland, offers commercial and business banking services. The Bank also operates a lending office for mortgage banking activities in Vancouver.
 
Vancouver is located in Clark County, Washington, which is just north of Portland, Oregon. Many businesses are located in the Vancouver area because of the favorable tax structure and lower energy costs in Washington as compared to Oregon. Companies located in the Vancouver area include: Sharp Microelectronics, Hewlett Packard, Georgia Pacific, Underwriters Laboratory, WaferTech, Nautilus, Barrett Business Services, PeaceHealth, Fisher Investments and Banfield Pet Hospitals, as well as several support industries. In addition to this industry base, the Columbia River Gorge Scenic Area and the Portland metropolitan area are sources of tourism, which has helped to transform the area from its past dependence on the timber industry.
 
Economic conditions in the Company's market areas continue to be better than those in the past recessionary downturn. According to the Washington State Employment Security Department, unemployment in Clark County decreased to 5.3% at March 31, 2019 compared to 5.4% at March 31, 2018. According to the Oregon Employment Department, unemployment in Portland increased to 3.9% at March 31, 2019 compared to 3.7% at March 31, 2018.

A substantial portion of the Company's loan portfolio is secured by real estate, either as primary or secondary collateral, located in its primary market area. The Company's lending activities are subject to the written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the Bank's Board of Directors ("Board") and management. The customary sources of loan originations are realtors, walk-in customers, referrals and existing customers. The Bank also uses commissioned loan brokers and print advertising to market its products and services. Loans are approved at various levels of management, depending upon the amount of the loan.

Commercial Business Lending. At March 31, 2019, the commercial business loan portfolio totaled $162.8 million, or 18.6% of total loans. Commercial business loans are typically secured by business equipment, accounts receivable, inventory or other property. The Company's commercial business loans may be structured as term loans or as lines of credit. Commercial term loans are generally made to finance the purchase of assets and usually have maturities of five years or less. Commercial lines of credit are typically made for the purpose of providing working capital and usually have a term of one year or less. Lines of credit are made at variable rates of interest equal to a negotiated margin above an index rate and term loans are at either a variable or fixed rate. The Company also generally obtains personal guarantees from financially capable parties based on a review of personal financial statements.
 
Commercial business lending involves risks that are different from those associated with residential and commercial real estate lending. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories may be obsolete or of limited use, among other things. Accordingly, the repayment of commercial business loans depends primarily on the cash flow and credit-worthiness of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Additionally, the borrower's cash flow may be unpredictable and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value.
 
Other Real Estate Mortgage Lending.  At March 31, 2019, the other real estate mortgage loan portfolio totaled $530.0 million, or 60.5% of total loans. The Company originates other real estate mortgage loans secured by office buildings, warehouse/industrial, retail, assisted living facilities and single-purpose facilities (collectively "commercial real estate loans" or "CRE"); as well as land and multi-family loans primarily located in its market area. At March 31, 2019, owner occupied properties accounted for 34.4% and non-owner occupied properties accounted for 65.6% of the Company's commercial real estate loan portfolio.

Commercial real estate and multi-family loans typically have higher loan balances, are more difficult to evaluate and monitor, and involve a higher degree of risk than one-to-four family residential loans. As a result, commercial real estate and multi-family loans are generally priced at a higher rate of interest than residential one-to-four family loans. Often payments on loans secured by commercial properties are dependent on the successful operation and management of the property securing the loan or business conducted on the property securing the loan; therefore, repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateral based lending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan to collateral values and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral being viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. The Company seeks to minimize these risks by generally limiting the maximum loan-to-value ratio to 80% and strictly scrutinizing the financial condition of the borrower, the quality of the collateral and the management of the property securing the loan. Loans are secured by first mortgages and often require specified debt service coverage ("DSC") ratios depending on the characteristics of the collateral. The Company generally imposes a minimum DSC ratio of 1.20 for loans secured by income producing properties. Rates and other terms on such loans generally depend on our assessment of credit risk after considering such factors as the borrower's financial condition and credit history, loan-to-value ratio, DSC ratio and other factors.
 
The Company actively pursues commercial real estate loans. Loan demand within the Company's market area was competitive in fiscal year 2019 as economic conditions and competition for strong credit-worthy borrowers remained high. At March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had the same two commercial real estate loans totaling $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively, on non-accrual status. For more information concerning risks related to commercial real estate loans, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors – Our emphasis on commercial real estate lending may expose us to increased lending risks."
 
Land acquisition and development loans are included in the other real estate mortgage loan portfolio balance and represent loans made to developers for the purpose of acquiring raw land and/or for the subsequent development and sale of residential lots. Such loans typically finance land purchases and infrastructure development of properties (e.g. roads, utilities, etc.) with the aim of making improved lots ready for subsequent sales to consumers or builders for ultimate construction of residential units. The primary source of repayment is generally the cash flow from developer sale of lots or improved parcels of land, secondary sources and personal guarantees, which may provide an additional measure of security for such loans. At March 31, 2019, land acquisition and development loans totaled $17.0 million, or 1.94% of total loans compared to $15.3 million, or 1.89% of total loans at March 31, 2018. The largest land acquisition and development loan had an outstanding balance at March 31, 2019 of $2.8 million and was performing according to its original payment terms. At March 31, 2019, all of the land acquisition and development loans were secured by properties located in Washington and Oregon. At March 31, 2019, the Company had no land acquisition and development loans on non-accrual status.  At March 31, 2018, the Company had one land acquisition and development loan totaling $763,000 on non-accrual status.
 
Real Estate Construction.  The Company originates three types of residential construction loans: (i) speculative construction loans, (ii) custom/presold construction loans and (iii) construction/permanent loans. The Company also originates construction loans for the development of business properties and multi-family dwellings. All of the Company's real estate construction loans were made on properties located in Washington and Oregon.
 
The composition of the Company's construction loan portfolio, including undisbursed funds, was as follows at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 | At March 31, | 
-------------------------------------+--------------+--------
 | 2019 | | 2018 
 | Amount (1) | | Percent | | Amount (1) | | Percent
Speculative construction | $ | 12,315 | | 8.01 | % | $ | 7,589 | 6.80 | %
Commercial/multi-family construction | | 116,815 | | 76.01 | | | 80,357 | 72.04 | 
Custom/presold construction | | 19,643 | | 12.78 | | | 18,029 | 16.16 | 
Construction/permanent | | 4,923 | | 3.20 | | | 5,573 | 5.00 | 
Total | $ | 153,696 | | 100.00 | % | $ | 111,548 | 100.00 | %




(1) Includes undisbursed funds of $62.8 million and $72.0 million at March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
At March 31, 2019, the balance of the Company's construction loan portfolio, including undisbursed funds, was $153.7 million compared to $111.5 million at March 31, 2018. The $42.1 million increase was primarily due to a $36.5 million increase in commercial/multi-family construction loans along with an increase of $4.7 million in speculative construction loans. The Company plans to continue to proactively manage and control the growth in its construction loan portfolio in fiscal year 2020 but will continue to originate new construction loans to selected customers.

Speculative construction loans are made to home builders and are termed "speculative" because the home builder does not have, at the time of loan origination, a signed contract with a home buyer who has a commitment for permanent financing with either the Company or another lender for the finished home. The home buyer may be identified either during or after the construction period, with the risk that the builder will have to service the speculative construction loan and finance real estate taxes and other carrying costs of the completed home for a significant period of time after the completion of construction until a home buyer is identified. The largest speculative construction loan at March 31, 2019 was a loan to finance the construction of a single family home totaling $929,000. This loan is to a single borrower that is secured by a property located in the Company's market area. The average balance of loans in the speculative construction loan portfolio at March 31, 2019 was $275,000. At March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no speculative construction loans on non-accrual status.

Total | $ | 882 | $ | 1,302 | $ | 26,570 | $ | 28,754



Unlike speculative construction loans, presold construction loans are made for homes that have buyers. Presold construction loans are made to homebuilders who, at the time of construction, have a signed contract with a home buyer who has a commitment for permanent financing for the finished home from the Company or another lender. Presold construction loans are generally originated for a term of 12 months. At March 31, 2019 and 2018, presold construction loans totaled $8.5 million and $9.0 million, respectively.
 
Unlike speculative and presold construction loans, custom construction loans are made directly to the homeowner. At March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no custom construction loans. Construction/permanent loans are originated to the homeowner rather than the homebuilder along with a commitment by the Company to originate a permanent loan to the homeowner to repay the construction loan at the completion of construction. The construction phase of a construction/permanent loan generally lasts six to nine months. At the completion of construction, the Company may either originate a fixed-rate mortgage loan or an adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loan or use its mortgage brokerage capabilities to obtain permanent financing for the customer with another lender. For adjustable rate loans, the interest rates adjust on their first adjustment date. See "Mortgage Brokerage" and "Mortgage Loan Servicing" below for more information. At March 31, 2019, construction/permanent loans totaled $3.3 million, the largest of which had an outstanding balance of $1.4 million and was performing according to its original repayment terms. The average balance of loans in the construction/permanent loan portfolio at March 31, 2019 was $410,000.
 
The Company provides construction financing for non-residential business properties and multi-family dwellings. At March 31, 2019, such loans totaled $70.5 million, or 77.6% of total real estate construction loans and 8.05% of total loans. Borrowers may be the business owner/occupier of the building who intends to operate their business from the property upon construction, or non-owner developers. The expected source of repayment of these loans is typically the sale or refinancing of the project upon completion of the construction phase. In certain circumstances, the Company may provide or commit to take-out financing upon construction. Take-out financing is subject to the project meeting specific underwriting guidelines. No assurance can be given that such take-out financing will be available upon project completion. These loans are secured by office buildings, retail rental space, mini storage facilities, assisted living facilities and multi-family dwellings located in the Company's market area. At March 31, 2019, the largest commercial construction loan had a balance of $11.4 million and was performing according to its original repayment terms. The average balance of loans in the commercial construction loan portfolio at March 31, 2019 was $3.1 million. At March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no commercial construction loans on non-accrual status.

The Company has originated construction and land acquisition and development loans where a component of the cost of the project was the interest required to service the debt during the construction period of the loan, sometimes known as interest reserves. The Company allows disbursements of this interest component as long as the project is progressing as originally projected and if there has been no deterioration in the financial standing of the borrower or the underlying project. If the Company makes a determination that there is such deterioration, or if the loan becomes nonperforming, the Company halts any disbursement of those funds identified for use in paying interest. In some cases, additional interest reserves may be taken by use of deposited funds or through credit lines secured by separate and additional collateral. For additional information concerning the risks related to construction lending, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors – Our real estate construction and land acquisition and development loans expose us to risk."
 
Consumer Lending. Consumer loans totaled $92.4 million at March 31, 2019 and were comprised of $65.3 million of one-to-four family mortgage loans, $17.2 million of home equity lines of credit, $1.5 million of land loans to consumers for the future construction of one-to-four family homes and $8.4 million of other secured and unsecured consumer loans, which primarily consisted of $5.8 million of purchased automobile loans.
 
One-to-four family residences located in the Company's primary market area secure the majority of the residential loans. Underwriting standards require that one-to-four family portfolio loans generally be owner occupied and that loan amounts not exceed 80% (95% with private mortgage insurance) of the lesser of current appraised value or cost of the underlying collateral. Terms typically range from 15 to 30 years. The Company also offers balloon mortgage loans with terms of either five or seven years and originates both fixed-rate mortgages and ARMs with repricing based on the one-year constant maturity U.S. Treasury index or other index. At March 31, 2019, the Company had three residential real estate loans totaling $169,000 on non-accrual status compared to four loans totaling $206,000 at March 31, 2018. All of these loans were secured by properties located in Oregon and Washington.
 
The Company also purchases, from time to time, pools of automobile loans from another financial institution as a way to further diversify its loan portfolio and to earn a higher yield than on its cash or short-term investments. These indirect automobile loans are originated through a single dealership group located outside the Company's primary market area. Unlike a direct loan where the borrower makes an application directly to the lender, in these loans the dealer, who has a direct financial interest in the loan transaction, assists the borrower in preparing the loan application. Indirect automobile loans we purchased are underwritten by us using substantially similar guidelines to our internal guidelines. However, because these loans are originated through a third-party and not directly by us, we do not have direct contact with the borrower and therefore these loans may be more susceptible to a material misstatement on the loan application and present greater risks than other types of lending activities. The collateral for these loans is comprised of a mix of used automobiles. These loans are purchased with servicing retained by the seller. The Company did not purchase any automobile loans during fiscal years 2019 and 2018. At March 31, 2019, twelve of the purchased automobile loans were on non-accrual status totaling $41,000. At March 31, 2018, eight of the purchased automobile loans were on non-accrual status totaling $71,000.
 
The Company originates a variety of installment loans, including loans for debt consolidation and other purposes, automobile loans, boat loans and savings account loans. At March 31, 2019 and 2018, excluding the purchased automobile loans noted above, the Company had no installment loans on non-accrual status.
 
Installment consumer loans generally entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such as mobile homes, automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles. In these cases, we face the risk that any collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. Thus, the recovery and sale of such property could be insufficient to compensate us for the principal outstanding on these loans. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit our ability to recover on such loans. Finally, because indirect automobile loan applications are originated by automobile dealerships, we underwrite the loans and we assume the risks associated with unsatisfactory origination procedures, including compliance with federal, state and local laws. In addition, since a third-party services these loans for us, any failure of our third-party servicer to timely pursue repossession action may adversely affect our ability to limit our credit losses. As a result of these factors, it may become necessary to increase our provision for loan losses in the event our losses on these loans increase, which could negatively affect our results of operations.

Loan Commitments. The Company issues commitments to originate commercial loans, other real estate mortgage loans, construction loans, residential mortgage loans and other installment loans conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Commitments to originate loans are conditional and are honored for up to 45 days subject to the Company's usual terms and conditions. Collateral is not required to support commitments. At March 31, 2019, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $40.7 million compared to $35.1 million at March 31, 2018.
Mortgage Brokerage. In addition to originating mortgage loans for retention in its loan portfolio, the Company employs commissioned brokers who originate mortgage loans (including construction loans) for various mortgage companies, as well as for the Company. The loans brokered to mortgage companies are closed in the name of, and funded by, the purchasing mortgage company and are not originated as an asset of the Company. In return, the Company receives a fee ranging from 1.5% to 2.0% of the loan amount that it shares with the commissioned broker. Loans brokered to the Company are closed on the Company's books and the commissioned broker receives a portion of the origination fee. During the year ended March 31, 2019, brokered loans totaled $35.0 million (including $10.4 million brokered to the Company) compared to $43.4 million (including $11.9 million brokered to the Company) of brokered loans in fiscal year 2018. Gross fees of $504,000 and $746,000, which includes brokered loan fees and fees for loans sold to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Company ("FHLMC"), were earned for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The interest rate environment has a strong influence on the loan volume and amount of fees generated from the mortgage broker activity. In general, during periods of rising interest rates, the volume of loans and the amount of loan fees generally decrease as a result of slower mortgage loan demand. Conversely, during periods of falling interest rates, the volume of loans and the amount of loan fees generally increase as a result of the increased mortgage loan demand.
 
 11 

Mortgage Loan Servicing.  The Company is a qualified servicer for the FHLMC. The Company generally sells fixed-rate residential one-to-four family mortgage loans that it originates with maturities of 15 years or more and balloon mortgages to the FHLMC as part of its asset/liability strategy. Mortgage loans are sold to the FHLMC on a non-recourse basis whereby foreclosure losses are the responsibility of the FHLMC and not the Company. The Company's general policy is to close its residential loans on FHLMC modified loan documents to facilitate future sales to the FHLMC. Upon sale, the Company continues to collect payments on the loans, supervise foreclosure proceedings, and otherwise service the loans. At March 31, 2019, total loans serviced for others were $149.4 million, of which $111.4 million were serviced for the FHLMC.
Nonperforming Assets.  Nonperforming assets were $1.5 million or 0.13% of total assets at March 31, 2019 compared with $2.7 million or 0.24% of total assets at March 31, 2018. The Company had net loan recoveries totaling $641,000 during fiscal 2019 compared to $238,000 during fiscal 2018. Credit quality metrics continued to improve in the past fiscal year and the real estate market in our primary market area has improved steadily. Although it appears the economic conditions have stabilized, an economic downturn in our market area could result in increases in nonperforming assets, increases in the provision for loan losses and charge-offs in the future.
 
Loans are reviewed regularly and it is the Company's general policy that when a loan is 90 days delinquent or when collection of principal or interest appears doubtful, it is placed on non-accrual status, at which time the accrual of interest ceases and a reserve for any unrecoverable accrued interest is established and charged against operations. In general, payments received on non-accrual loans are applied to reduce the outstanding principal balance on a cash-basis method.
 
The Company continues to proactively manage its residential construction and land acquisition and development loan portfolios. At March 31, 2019, the Company's residential construction and land acquisition and development loan portfolios were $20.3 million and $17.0 million, respectively, as compared to $16.4 million and $15.3 million, respectively, at March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no nonperforming loans in the residential construction loan portfolio. At March 31, 2019, there were no non-performing loans in the land acquisition and development portfolio. At March 31, 2018, the percentage of nonperforming loans in the land acquisition and development portfolio was 4.97%. For the year ended March 31, 2019, there were no charge-offs or recoveries in the residential construction and land acquisition and development loan portfolios. For the year ended March 31, 2018, the charge-off (recovery) ratio in the residential construction and land acquisition and development portfolio was 0.00% and (1.87)%, respectively.

Nonperforming loans decreased compared to the prior fiscal year. The Company continues its efforts to work out problem loans, seek full repayment or pursue foreclosure proceedings. All of these loans are to borrowers with properties located in Oregon and Washington, with the exception of thirteen automobile loans totaling $44,000. At March 31, 2019, 81.70% of the Company's nonperforming loans, totaling $1.2 million, were measured for impairment. These loans have been charged down to the estimated fair market value of the collateral less selling costs or carry a specific reserve to reduce the net carrying value. There were no reserves associated with these nonperforming loans that were measured for impairment at March 31, 2019. At March 31, 2019, the largest single nonperforming loan was a commercial real estate loan totaling $896,000. This loan was measured for impairment during fiscal year 2019 and management determined that a specific reserve was not required.

Other loans of concern, which are classified as substandard loans and are not presently included in the non-accrual category, consist of loans where the borrowers have cash flow problems, or the collateral securing the respective loans may be inadequate. In either or both of these situations, the borrowers may be unable to comply with the present loan repayment terms, and the loans may subsequently be included in the non-accrual category. Management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to cover the probable losses inherent in these and other loans.

2018. At March 31, 2019, there were no loans 30-89 days past due in our commercial business portfolio.  At March 31, 2018, the 30 – 89 days delinquency rate in our commercial business loan portfolio was 0.01% of commercial business loans. CRE loans represent the largest portion of our loan portfolio at 52.67% of total loans and commercial business loans represent 18.58% of total loans.
 
Troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") are loans for which the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial condition, has granted a concession to the borrower that it would otherwise not consider. A TDR typically involves a modification of terms such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or face amount of the loan, a reduction of accrued interest, and/or an extension of the maturity date(s) at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk.
 
TDRs are considered impaired loans and as such, when a loan is deemed to be impaired, the amount of the impairment is measured using discounted cash flows and the original note rate, except when the loan is collateral dependent. In these cases, the estimated fair value of the collateral (less any selling costs, if applicable) is used. Impairment is recognized as a specific component within the allowance for loan losses if the estimated value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan. When the amount of the impairment represents a confirmed loss, it is charged off against the allowance for loan losses. At March 31, 2019, the Company had TDRs totaling $5.7 million, of which $4.4 million were on accrual status. The $1.3 million of TDRs accounted for on a non-accrual basis at March 31, 2019 are included as nonperforming loans in the nonperforming asset table above. All of the Company's TDRs were paying as agreed at March 31, 2019.  The related amount of interest income recognized on these TDR loans was $204,000 for the year ended March 31, 2019.
 
The Company has determined that, in certain circumstances, it is appropriate to split a loan into multiple notes. This typically includes a nonperforming charged-off loan that is not supported by the cash flow of the relationship and a performing loan that is supported by the cash flow. These may also be split into multiple notes to align portions of the loan balance with the various sources of repayment when more than one exists. Generally, the new loans are restructured based on customary underwriting standards. In situations where they are not, the policy exception qualifies as a concession, and if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, the loans are accounted for as TDRs.
 
The accrual status of a loan may change after it has been classified as a TDR. The Company's general policy related to TDRs is to perform a credit evaluation of the borrower's financial condition and prospects for repayment under the revised terms. This evaluation includes consideration of the borrower's sustained historical repayment performance for a reasonable period of time. A sustained period of repayment performance generally would be a minimum of six months and may include repayments made prior to the restructuring date. If repayment of principal and interest appears doubtful, it is placed on non-accrual status.
 
In accordance with the Company's policy guidelines, unsecured loans are generally charged-off when no payments have been received for three consecutive months unless an alternative action plan is in effect. Consumer installment loans delinquent six months or more that have not received at least 75% of their required monthly payment in the last 90 days are charged-off. In addition, loans discharged in bankruptcy proceedings are charged-off. Loans under bankruptcy protection with no payments received for four consecutive months are charged-off. The outstanding balance of a secured loan that is in excess of the net realizable value is generally charged-off if no payments are received for four to five consecutive months. However, charge-offs are postponed if alternative proposals to restructure, obtain additional guarantors, obtain additional assets as collateral or a potential sale of the underlying collateral would result in full repayment of the outstanding loan balance. Once any other potential sources of repayment are exhausted, the impaired portion of the loan is charged-off. Regardless of whether a loan is unsecured or collateralized, once an amount is determined to be a confirmed loan loss it is promptly charged off.
 
Asset Classification. The OCC has adopted various regulations regarding problem assets of savings institutions. The regulations require that each insured institution review and classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with examinations of insured institutions, OCC examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified as such. There are three classifications for problem assets:  substandard, doubtful and loss (collectively "classified loans"). Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted.
 
 14 


When the Company classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, we may determine that the loan is impaired and establish a specific allowance in an amount we deem prudent to address the risk specifically or we may allow the loss to be addressed in the general allowance. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been specifically allocated to particular problem assets. When a problem asset is classified by us as a loss, we are required to charge off the asset in the period in which it is deemed uncollectible.
 
The aggregate amount of the Company's classified loans (comprised entirely of substandard loans), general loss allowances, specific loss allowances and net recoveries were as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands):
 
 
 | At or For the Year | 
-------------------------+--------------------+-------
 | Ended March 31, | 
 | 2019 | | | 2018 | 
Classified loans | $ | 6,306 | | | $ | 7,423 | 
General loss allowances | | 11,435 | | | | 10,697 | 
Specific loss allowances | | 22 | | | | 69 | 
Net recoveries | | (641 | ) | | | (238 | )



All of the loans on non-accrual status as of March 31, 2019 were categorized as classified loans. Classified loans at March 31, 2019 were comprised of eleven commercial business loans totaling $2.0 million, five commercial real estate loans totaling $3.4 million (the largest of which was $1.6 million), two multi-family loans totaling $20,000, one land development loan totaling $728,000, three one-to-four family real estate loans totaling $169,000 and twelve purchased automobile loans totaling $41,000.
 
Allowance for Loan Losses. The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.) ("GAAP") guidelines. The adequacy of the allowance is evaluated monthly to maintain the allowance at levels sufficient to provide for inherent losses existing at the balance sheet date. The key components to the evaluation are the Company's internal loan review function by its credit administration, which reviews and monitors the risk and quality of the loan portfolio; as well as the Company's external loan reviews and its loan classification systems. Credit officers are expected to monitor their loan portfolios and make recommendations to change loan grades whenever changes are warranted. Credit administration approves any changes to loan grades and monitors loan grades. For additional discussion of the Company's methodology for assessing the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses see
