Item 1.   Business 
Company Overview and History
 
Nuvera is a diversified communications company headquartered in New Ulm, Minnesota with more than 117 years of experience in the communications business. We operate in one principal business segment: the Communications Segment.
 
Our principal line of business is the operation of seven communications companies. Our original business was founded in 1905 and consisted of the operation of a single communications company (New Ulm Rural Telephone Company). In 1984, we changed our name to New Ulm Telecom, Inc. In 1986, we acquired Western Telephone Company (WTC). In 1993, we acquired Peoples Telephone Company (PTC). In 2008, we acquired Hutchinson Telephone Company (HTC). In 2012, we acquired Sleepy Eye Telephone Company (SETC). In 2018, we acquired Scott-Rice Telephone Co. (Scott-Rice). Our businesses consist of connecting customers to our advanced fiber communications network, providing managed services, switched service and dedicated private lines, connecting customers to long distance service providers and providing many other services associated with our businesses. Our businesses also provide Internet protocol television (IPTV), cable television services (CATV), Internet access services, including high-speed broadband access, and long distance service. We also install and maintain communications systems to the areas in and around our service territories in southern Minnesota and northern Iowa. In 2008 we acquired Hutchinson Telecommunications, Inc. This company operates in and around the city of Litchfield, Minnesota and operates under less regulatory oversight than our other communications companies. In 2010, we acquired the cable TV system in the city of Glencoe and operate Glencoe under the Hutchinson Telecommunications, Inc. communications company. This company offers the same services as our other communications companies. In 2000, we changed our marketing name to NU-Telecom and operated under that name in our markets. In 2018, we changed our marketing name to Nuvera and currently operate under that name in our markets.
 
We are closely monitoring the impact on our business of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. For a discussion of the risks related to COVID-19, refer to Part I – Item 1A – “Risk Factors” and Part II – Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
 
Recent Business Development
 
On December 15, 2021, the Company announced plans to build and deploy gigabit-speed (Gig or Gbps) fiber Internet across its network creating crucial access to the fastest speeds available for rural communities, small cities and suburban areas across Minnesota. “This is a transformational moment for Nuvera as we make a future-focused investment in the communities we serve by providing the most reliable fiber-to-the-premise (FTTP) access to Gig-speed services,” said Glenn Zerbe, CEO. “Our homes, businesses and communities need reliable and affordable connections to school, workplaces and entertainment, as an important and growing part of everyday life.” “Nuvera’s investment in fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network infrastructure will allow more underserved communities across Minnesota to leverage the quality of life and economic opportunity that access to a state-of-the-art network provides now and for years to come,” said State Senator Nick Frentz, DFL-North Mankato. Nuvera’s Gig-speed end-to-end fiber network is building and rolling out now. Service will be available for thousands of customers in 2022. The company will continue to build and deploy the Gig-speed service over the next few years. “We’re excited to create ‘Nuvera Gig Cities’ in the communities we serve while also expanding access to fiber-based Internet service at a range of speeds,” said Zerbe. “Nuvera’s fiber network gives customers affordable access to a range of speeds from 100 Megabits per second (Mbps) to 1 Gig at prices that are the same whether you’re in rural Goodhue or suburban Prior Lake.” 
 


While Nuvera’s goal is to bring Gig-speed service to as many communities as possible, the initial buildout will focus on the following cities and surrounding communities: 
 
●         New Ulm
 ●         Hutchinson
 ●         Glencoe
 ●         Goodhue
 ●         Litchfield
 ●         Redwood Falls
 ●         Prior Lake
 ●         Elko New Market
 ●         Savage
 ●         Sleepy Eye
 ●         Springfield
 ●         Aurelia, IA
 
Nuvera’s fiber Internet prices range from $50 per month to $125 per month for Gig-speed services. Customers can choose the right speed at an affordable price, including low-income households through Federal programs.

We report the business operations of our seven communications companies and their associated services as a single segment that we refer to as the Communications Segment.  
 
The Communications Segment operates the following communications companies: Nuvera, HTC, PTC, Scott-Rice, SETC, WTC and Litchfield, Minnesota. Nuvera, HTC, Scott-Rice, SETC, WTC and Litchfield are independent communications companies that are regulated by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission at the state level, while PTC is an independent communications company that is regulated by the Iowa Utilities Board at the state level. Our communications companies located in Redwood Falls and Litchfield are currently not under the same level of regulatory oversight as our other communications companies. As of December 31, 2022 we served 32,675 broadband connections and 15,426 access lines in the Minnesota communities of Bellechester, Courtland, Evan, Goodhue, Hanska, Hutchinson, Klossner, Litchfield, Mazeppa, Elko New Market, New Ulm, Prior Lake, Redwood Falls, Sanborn, Savage, Searles, Sleepy Eye, Springfield and White Rock, as well as the adjacent rural areas of Blue Earth, Brown, Goodhue, McLeod, Meeker, Nicollet, Redwood, Rice, Scott and Wabasha counties in south central Minnesota. We also serve the community of Aurelia, Iowa as well as the adjacent rural areas surrounding Aurelia. The Communications Segment also operates multiple IPTV and CATV systems in Minnesota (including the cities of Cologne, Courtland, Glencoe, Goodhue, Hanska, Hutchinson, Litchfield, Mayer, Elko New Market, New Germany, New Ulm, Plato, Prior Lake, Redwood Falls, Sanborn, Savage, Sleepy Eye and Springfield) and one IPTV system in Aurelia, Iowa. These systems serve 9,099 customers.  
 
The Communications Segment derives its principal revenues from (i) voice service charges to its residential and business subscribers, (ii) access charges to Interexchange Carriers (IXCs) for providing the carriers access to our local phone networks and (iii) the provisioning of video and data services. 
 
None of our communications companies are dependent upon any single customer or small group of customers. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues in any of the last two years.
 
We provide a variety of business communication services to small, medium and large business customers, including many services over our advanced fiber-optic (fiber) network. The services we offer include scalable high speed broadband Internet access and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) phone services, which range from basic service plans to virtual hosted systems. Our hosted VoIP package utilizes our soft switching technology and enables our customers to have the flexibility of employing new telephone advances and features without investing in a new telephone system. This package includes voice service, calling features, IP business telephones and unified messaging, which integrates multiple technologies into a single system and allows the customer to receive and listen to voice messages through e-mail.  
 
In addition to Internet and VoIP services, we also offer a variety of commercial data connectivity services in select markets including private line and Ethernet services to provide high bandwidth across point-to-point and multiple site networks.
 
We receive the majority of our revenues through the following sources:
 
Voice Service – We receive recurring revenue for basic voice services that enable end-user customers to make and receive telephone calls within a defined local calling area for a flat monthly fee. In addition to subscribing to basic local telephone services, our customers may choose from multiple voice service plans with a variety of custom calling features such as call waiting, call forwarding, caller identification and voicemail. Our VoIP digital phone service is also available as an alternative to the traditional telephone line.  
 
Network Access – We provide access services to other communications carriers for the use of our facilities to terminate or originate long distance calls on our fiber network. Additionally, we bill monthly subscriber line charges (SLCs) to substantially all of our customers for access to the public switched network. These monthly SLCs are regulated and approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In addition, network access revenue is derived from several federally administered pooling arrangements designed to provide support and distribute funding to us.  
 


Video Service – We provide a variety of enhanced video services on a monthly recurring basis to our customers. Depending on geographical market availability, our video services range from limited basic service to advanced digital TV, which includes several plans each with hundreds of local, national music channels including premium and pay-per-view channels as well as video-on-demand service. Certain customers may also subscribe to our advanced video services, which consist of high-definition (HD) TV, digital video recorders (DVR) and Whole Home DVR. Our Whole Home DVR allows customers the ability to watch recorded shows on any TV in the house, record multiple shows at one time and utilize an intuitive on-screen guide and user interface. Video subscribers also have access to our TV Everywhere service which allows subscriber access to full episodes of available shows, movies and live screens using a computer or mobile device. We also receive monthly recurring revenue from our subscribers for providing commercial TV programming in competition with local CATV, satellite dish TV and off-air TV service providers. We serve twenty-two communities with our IPTV services and five communities with our CATV services. 
 
Data Service – We provide high speed Internet to business and residential customers depending on the nature of the network facilities that are available, the level of service selected and the location. Our revenue is earned based on the offering of various flat rate packages based on the level of service, data speeds and features. We also provide e-mail and managed services, such as web hosting and design, on-line file back up and on-line file storage. 
 
Alternative Connect America Cost Model (A-Cam)/Federal Universal Service Fund (FUSF) – The Company currently receives funding based on the A-CAM, with the exception of Scott-Rice, which receives funding from the FUSF. Scott-Rice’s settlements from the National Exchange Carriers Association (NECA) pools are based on nationwide average schedules, which includes the pooling and redistribution of revenues based on a company’s actual or average costs. See below for a discussion regarding A-CAM and FUSF. 
 
Other – Our customers are billed for toll and long-distance services on either a per call or flat-rate basis. This also includes the offering of directory assistance, operator service and long distance private lines. We also generate revenue from directory publishing through an outside vendor, sales and service of customer premise equipment (CPE), bill processing and other customer services. Our directory publishing revenue in our telephone directories recurs monthly. We also provide retail sales and service of cellular phones and accessories through Telespire, a national wireless provider. We resell these wireless services as Nuvera Wireless, our branded product. We receive both recurring revenue for our wireless services, as well as revenue collected for the sale of wireless phones and accessories.

Our online customer portal enables customers to pay their bills, manage their accounts, order new services and utilize self-service help and support. Our priority is to continue enhancing our comprehensive customer care system in order to produce a high level of customer satisfaction and loyalty, which is important to our ability to reduce churn and generate recurring revenues.
 
Business Strategies 
 
Transform our Company into a dominant fiber; gig broadband provider
 
On December 15, 2021, the Company announced plans to build and deploy Gig-speed fiber Internet across its network creating crucial access to the fastest speeds available for rural communities, small cities and suburban areas across Minnesota. The five-year build plan, which began in late 2021, will when complete, include approximately 60,000 location passings to fiber enabling Gig-capable services by 2025. In 2022, we upgraded 11,133 locations with fiber services and faster broadband speeds and plan to upgrade more than 17,000 locations in 2023. This marks the biggest fiber deployment project in our Company’s history. In addition, to best-in-class upload and download speeds, we believe the resulting fiber network will offer better reliability, improved speed consistency, and a lower operating cost relative to competing broadband network technologies. Given these benefits, we believe that our fiber deployment strategy will allow us to realize meaningful improvements to our operating results, broadband subscriber penetration and customer retention. 
 
We believe our customers place a value on the fact that we are a local company whose goal is to meet their total communications needs. The success of this vision depends on the following strategies: 
 
●      We have and will continue to upgrade our fiber networks through our five-year build plan and enhance our products and services to take advantage of the latest technology including advanced high-bandwidth capabilities and services, expansion of our fiber network for wholesale and retail customers, Fiber-to-the-Tower services for wireless carriers and last mile fiber builds to residential and business customers. We intend to continue to introduce new services that draw upon our core competencies and we believe are attractive to our target customers. In considering new services and market expansion, we look for market opportunities that we believe present growth opportunities. 
 
●      As consumer demands for bandwidth continue to increase, our focus is on enhancing our broadband services, and progressively increasing broadband speeds. We began an extensive FTTP overbuild in portions of New Ulm in 2021 and all of our service territories in 2022. We currently offer speeds of up to 1 Gbps in select areas where fiber is available, and up to 100 Mbps and 60 Mbps in areas where 1 Gbps is not yet available. As we continue to increase broadband speeds, we are also able to simultaneously expand the array of services and content offerings that the fiber network provides. 
 
●      We market services to our residential and business customers. Data connections continue to increase as a result of consumer trends towards increased Internet usage and our enhanced product and service offerings.
 
●      Our consumer broadband speed allows us to continue to meet the needs of our customers and the demand for higher speed resulting from the growing trend of over-the-top (OTT) content viewing. The availability of faster speeds also complements our Wi-Fi and supports our TV everywhere service and allows our subscribers to watch their favorite programs at home or away on a computer, smartphone or tablet.
 
●      We tailor our services to commercial customers by developing solutions to fit their specific needs. We provide services to a wide range of commercial customers from sole proprietors and other small businesses to multi-location corporations. Our business suite of services includes local and long-distance calling plans, hosted voice services using network servers, the added capacity for multiple phone lines, scalable broadband Internet, online back up and business directory listings. 
 


●      We believe that we have several advantages over our competition, including an advanced fiber communications network, competitive pricing and costs, outstanding service quality, a strong reputation, a high level of commitment to the communities we serve and a direct billing relationship with a vast majority of the customers we serve in our service territories. We manage the potential decline in communications network access and voice service revenues by offering value-added services such as higher Internet speeds, HD IPTV, DVR services, managed services, customized communications solutions, along with outstanding customer service as a competitive differentiator. 
 
●      We continue to seek ways to improve our internal processes and gain operational efficiencies. While focusing resources on revenue growth and market share gains, we continually challenge our management team and employees at all levels to seek efficiencies and enhance our customers’ experience. We continue to invest in our fiber networks and train our employees to achieve customer service excellence. 
 
●      Our current customer base provides a recurring revenue stream generating stable cash flow. Our focus remains on growing our services and supporting product lines so as to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our current operations, service our debt, fund our capital expenditure needs, pay dividends and expand our business. We have allocated resources to maintain and upgrade our fiber network while focusing on optimizing returns by completing strategic capital outlays that will make our fiber network more efficient and cost effective while providing the products and services that our customers desire in the markets we serve.
 
●      We intend to continue to pursue a disciplined process of evaluating acquisitions of businesses as well as organic growth opportunities of market expansion and/or products which are complementary to our business portfolio. 
 
●      Across all of our service territories, we have successfully managed capital expenditures to optimize returns through disciplined planning and targeted investment of capital. For example, strategic investments in our fiber networks allows significant flexibility to expand our commercial footprint, offer competitive products and services and provide services in a cost-efficient manner while maintaining our reputation as a high-quality service provider. We will continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives to enhance and expand our fiber network to new markets and customers in order to optimize new business, backhaul and wholesale opportunities. 
 
●      Commercial services are expected to be a key growth area in the future. We are focused on enhancing our broadband and commercial product suite and are continually enhancing our commercial product offerings to meet the needs of our business customers. We overbuilt our existing networks with advanced fiber networks in the commercial areas of New Ulm, Prior Lake and Hutchinson in 2021, 2020 and 2019. We tailor our services for business customers by developing solutions to fit their specific needs. Additionally, we are continuously enhancing our suite of managed and cloud services, which increases efficiency and enables greater scalability and reliability for businesses. We are utilizing multiple software platforms to gather relevant leads and for customer relations management. 
 
●      In addition to Internet and VoIP services, we also offer a variety of commercial data connectivity services in select markets including Ethernet services; software defined wide area network (SD-WAN), a software-based network technology that provides a simplified management and automation of SD-WAN connections; multi-protocol label switching; and private line services to provide high bandwidth connectivity across point-to-point and multiple site networks. We offer a suite of cloud-based services, which includes a hosted unified communications solution that replaces the customer’s on-site phone systems and data networks, managed network security services and data protection services, including back-up and disaster recovery. 
 
Competition
 
We compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry, and expect competition will continue to intensify as consolidations and mergers occur within the industry. Regulatory developments and technological advances over the past several years have increased opportunities for alternative communications service providers, which in turn have increased competitive pressures on our business. These alternative providers often face fewer regulations and have lower cost structures than we do. In addition, several of our competitors have consolidated with other communication providers and as a result are generally larger, have more financial and business resources and have greater geographical reach to provide services. Our competitive advantages include: our strong commitment and presence in the communities we serve, knowledge of these markets, our experienced voice service and support team, and our ability to offer more flexible communications solutions than our larger competitors. 
 


The long-range effect of competition on the delivery of communications services and equipment will depend on technological advances, regulatory actions at both the federal and the state levels, court decisions, and possible additional future federal and state legislation. Past federal and state legislation have tended to expand competition in the communications industry.  
 
Alternatives to our service include customers leasing private line switched voice and data services in or adjacent to our service territories that permit the bypassing of our communications facilities. In addition, microwave transmission services, wireless communications, fiber/coaxial cable deployment, VoIP, satellite and other services also permit the bypassing of our local exchange network. These alternatives to local exchange service represent a potential threat to our long-term ability to provide local exchange services at economical rates. 
 
In order to meet competition present in our industry, we are deploying the latest FTTH technology to deliver our data, video and voice services at a higher bandwidth, enabling us to provide our services at much higher speeds.  
 
We compete in the cities of Redwood Falls, Litchfield and Glencoe, Minnesota. These communications companies are currently not under the same level of regulatory oversight as our communications companies. Lumen Technologies is the existing communications company in these markets. Competition also exists in the other communities and areas served by us for traditional telephone service from wireless communications providers and we also expect competition to increase from service providers offering VoIP. We experience competition in the Minnesota communities of Glencoe, Hutchinson, Litchfield, Elko New Market, New Ulm, Prior Lake, Redwood Falls, Savage, Sleepy Eye and Springfield in the provisioning of video services. Comcast is the existing incumbent provider of video services in the New Ulm market. Mediacom is the existing incumbent provider of video services in the Hutchinson, Litchfield, Elko New Market, Prior Lake, Redwood Falls, Savage, Sleepy Eye and Springfield markets. Several other communications providers compete with us in our markets in providing Internet services. We have responded to these competitive pressures by creating active programs to market our products and enhance our infrastructure to create higher customer value. 
 
We are experiencing competition for some of our other services from IXCs, such as customer billing services, dedicated private lines and network switching. The provisioning of these services is contractual in nature and is primarily directed by the IXCs. Other services, such as directory advertising, operator services and cellular communications are open to competition, based primarily on service and customer experience. 
 
We expect competition to remain a significant factor affecting our operating results and that the nature and extent of that competition will continue to increase in the future. See Part I – Item 1A – “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business”. 
 
Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 213 employees, including part-time employees. We also use temporary employees in the normal course of our business. Our employees are the cornerstone of our success. We are committed to providing meaningful, challenging work and opportunities for professional growth in a positive environment. To attract and retain qualified and experienced employees, we offer compensation and benefit packages, which we believe are competitive within the industry and the local markets in which we operate. Our benefit packages, may include, among other items, incentive compensation based on the achievement of financial targets, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, a 401(k) savings plan with an employer match, paid time off, and wellness and employee assistance programs. Additionally, for certain eligible employees, we provide long-term incentive compensation, in the form of non-qualified stock options (Options). In addition, we are committed to providing employees continuing education and training programs in order for employees to achieve career goals and professional growth. 
 


We embrace diversity and inclusion and seek to hire and retain high-quality employees of all backgrounds and experiences. Honoring our employees as individuals is key to our culture. We believe diversity of backgrounds contributes to different ideas, which in turn drives better results for customers. We respect differences and diversity as qualities that enhance our efforts as a team and believe embracing diversity and a culture of inclusion makes our company a better place to work. We believe in and support the principles incorporated in all anti-discrimination and equal employment laws. 
 
We also strive to create and provide a safe, healthful and secure workplace that is free from discrimination or harassment. Our workplace policies and procedures protect against behavior that creates an offensive, hostile, or intimidating work environment. Safety is a top priority and we have a strong, ongoing commitment to ensure employees are properly trained and have appropriate safety and emergency equipment. In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety protocols and procedures to protect our employees, customers and business partners. These procedures included transitioning as many employees as possible to remote work-from-home arrangements, providing additional safety training and personal protective equipment for customer and business-facing employees, and complying with social distancing and other health and safety measures as required by federal, state and local governmental agencies. 
 
Materials and Supplies
 
The materials and supplies that are necessary for our operations are available from a variety of sources. We are not dependent on any particular supplier or group of affiliated suppliers for our equipment needs. 
Regulation
 
The following summary provides a high-level overview, but may not include all present and proposed federal, state and local legislation and regulations affecting the communications industry. Some legislation and other regulations are currently the subject of judicial proceedings, legislative hearings and administrative proposals that could change the manner in which this industry operates. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these developments or their potential impact on us. Regulation can change rapidly in the communications industry and these changes could have an adverse effect on us in the future.
Overview
 
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), rules and regulations of the SEC and, where applicable, conform to the accounting principles as prescribed by federal and state telephone utility regulatory authorities.
 
The services we offer are subject to varying levels of regulatory oversight. Federal and state regulatory agencies share responsibility for enforcing statutes and rules relative to the provision of communications services. Our interstate communications services are subject to regulation by the FCC. Intrastate services are governed by the relevant state regulatory commission. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TA96) and the rules enacted under it also gave oversight of interconnection arrangements and access to network elements to the state commissions. Our TV services are governed by FCC rules and municipal franchise agreements. There are also varying levels of regulatory oversight depending on the nature of the services offered or if the services are offered by a communications company.
 
Our communications company located in Redwood Falls, Litchfield and Glencoe provides services with less regulatory oversight than our communications companies. A company must file for interexchange authority to operate with the appropriate public utility commission in each state it serves. Our communications company located in Redwood Falls, Litchfield and Glencoe provides a variety of services to both residential and business customers in multiple jurisdictions.
 


Federal Regulatory Framework
 
All carriers must comply with the FCC Act of 1934 (FCA34) as amended that requires, among other things, that our interstate services be provided at just and reasonable rates and on non-discriminatory terms and conditions. The TA96 amended the FCA34 and has had a dramatic effect on the competitive environment in the communications industry. In addition to these laws, we are also subject to rules promulgated by the FCC and could be affected by any regulatory decisions or orders they issue.
The TA96 and Local Competition 
 
The primary goal of the TA96 and the FCC’s rules promulgated under it was to open local communications markets to competition while enhancing universal service. To some extent, Congress pre-empted the local authority of states to oversee local communications services.
 
The TA96 imposes a number of requirements on all local communications providers including: 
 
●         To interconnect directly or indirectly with other carriers;  
 
●         To allow others to resell services; 
 
●         To provide for number portability to allow end-users to retain their telephone number when changing providers; 
 
●         To ensure dialing parity; 
 
●         To ensure that competitor customers have non-discriminatory access to telephone numbers, operator services, directory assistance and directory listing services; and 
 
●         To allow competitors access to telephone poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way, and to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of communications traffic.
 
Access Charges
 
Access charges refer to the compensation received by local exchange carriers (LECs) for the use of their networks by an IXC. We provide two types of access services: special access and switched access. Special access is provided through dedicated circuits that connect other carriers to our network and is structured on a flat monthly fee basis. Switched access rates that are billed to other carriers are based on a per-minute of use fee basis. The FCC regulates prices that we charge for interstate access charges. There has been a trend toward lowering the rates charged to carriers accessing local networks and the application of a SLC as a flat rate on end-user bills. Regulation, competition, carriers optimizing their network costs and lower demand for dedicated lines have resulted in lower access rates and overall lower minutes of use on our network, which has affected our network access revenues. 
 
Interstate access rates are established by the nationwide pooling of companies known as NECA. The FCC established NECA in 1983 to develop and administer interstate access service rates, terms and conditions. Revenues are pooled and redistributed on the basis of each company’s actual or average costs. There has been a change in the composition of interstate access charges in recent years, shifting more of the charges to the end user and reducing the amount of access charges paid by IXCs. We believe this trend will continue.  
 
Intrastate access rates are filed with the regulatory commissions in Minnesota and Iowa.
 
Wireline Interstate
 
Our communications companies participate in the NECA common line pool where end-user common line funds collected are pooled. A portion of our communications companies’ revenue are based on settlements distributed from this pool. Our communications companies also participates in the NECA traffic-sensitive pool. These pool settlements are adjusted periodically. 
 


Access rates for our communications company located in Redwood Falls, Litchfield and Glencoe were established according to an order issued by the FCC in 2001. Under that order, the switched access rates charged by a competitive carrier can be no higher than the rates charged by the communications company with whom we compete. 
 
Intercarrier Compensation (ICC) and FUSF Reform  
 
The FCC released the National Broadband Plan in April 2010 recommending significant changes to the access charge policy and processes. This was followed on November 18, 2011, by FCC Order 11-161 (the Transformation Order), with comprehensive rules reforming all forms of ICC and implementing a new support mechanism for the deployment of broadband. Generally, the ICC reform sets forth a path towards a “bill & keep” regime which eliminates compensation for termination of traffic received from another carrier. The timeline for this transition had numerous steps depending on the type of traffic exchanged and the regulated status of the affected LEC.  
 
These rules have been clarified in several orders on Reconsideration and have had an impact on our companies by reducing our terminating ICC, including intrastate and interstate access charges. 
 
The FCC Transformation Order also confirmed the applicability of access charges on VoIP traffic and eliminated reciprocal compensation charges for termination of local wireless traffic. Despite these changes IXCs and others are still quite aggressive in disputing carrier access charges and/or the applicability of access charges to their traffic. 
 
Due to the combination of rate reforms instituted by the FCC, competitive substitution by wireless and other carriers and decreased use of the switched network, the aggregate amount of interstate network access charges paid by long distance carriers to access providers such as our company, has decreased and we project that this decline will continue. For the year ended December 31, 2022, communications network access revenue represented 7.2% of our operating revenue, down from 8.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021. This excludes any funding received from FUSF and the A-CAM for broadband funding (see below for more information).
 
FUSF 
 
The FUSF was originally established to overcome geographic differences in costs of providing voice service and to enable all citizens to communicate over networks regardless of geographical location and/or personal income. The FCC established universal service policies at the national level under terms contained in the Telecommunications Act of 1934. The TA96 requires explicit FUSF mechanisms and enlarged the scope of universal service to include four distinct programs:
 
●         High-Cost program that supports local carriers operating in high-cost regions of the country to ensure reasonably based telephone rates; 
 
●         Lifeline (low-income) Subscribers program that includes the Link Up and Lifeline programs that provide support for service initiation and monthly fees and have eligibility based on subscriber income; 
 
●         Rural Health Care Providers program that supports communication services used by rural health care providers and provides them with toll free access to an Internet service provider; and 
 
●         Schools and Libraries program, also called the E-Rate program that provides support funding to schools and libraries for communications services, Internet access and internal connections.
 
In its Transformation Order released November 18, 2011, the FCC adopted rules which dramatically reform the universal service program and ICC regime. These rules eliminated the legacy Local Switching support, but also provide for a new Connect America Fund (CAF) support for rate of return carriers to make up some of their access revenue reductions and provide direct support to PriceCap carriers (i.e. the larger, national LECs such as Verizon and AT&T) for broadband build outs. The new rules have caused rates for end users to increase as ICC is reduced and the legacy mandate for ubiquitous voice service shifts toward broadband availability as a key outcome of the program.  
 


FUSF high-cost payments are distributed by NECA and are only available to carriers that have been designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier (ETC) by a state commission. Each of our communications companies has been designated as an ETC. Our communications company located in Redwood Falls, Litchfield and Glencoe is also eligible to be designated as ETCs if it meets the requirements of the program and meet a public interest standard as determined by the appropriate state regulatory agency. Our communications company located in Redwood Falls, Litchfield and Glencoe is currently not receiving FUSF support. All ETCs must certify annually to the Universal Service Administrative Company or their appropriate state regulatory commission that the funds they receive from the FUSF are being used in the manner intended. The states must then certify to the FCC which carriers have met this standard. The Transformation Order expands the information that must be reported to the State Commissions to include information on broadband availability, plans for expansion to unserved and underserved areas, in addition to information about voice services. To some extent, these levels of scrutiny make the receipt of a consistent level of FUSF payments each year more difficult to predict. 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we received an aggregate of $2,770,698 from FUSF, consisting of $1,467,845 of CAF support and $1,302,853 of Broadband Loop Support. Our net FUSF in 2022 comprised 4.2% of our total revenue for the year. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we received an aggregate of $2,793,354 from FUSF, consisting of $1,559,009 of CAF support and $1,234,345 of Broadband Loop Support.  Our net FUSF in 2021 comprised 4.2% of our total revenue for the year. We receive no State universal service funding as the states in which we operate have not established state universal service funding mechanisms.  

In 2019, the Company elected to receive funding from A-CAM, with the exception of Scott-Rice, which still receives funding from the FUSF. 
 
A-CAM
 
The FUSF was established as part of the TA96 and provides subsidies to communications providers as means of increasing the availability and affordability of advanced communications services. In 2011, significant reform was introduced, including the creation of the CAF, to help modernize the FUSF and promote support of these communications services in the nation’s high-cost areas. In 2016, the FCC announced additional reform to further transition the CAF from supporting the provision of voice services to the provision of broadband services. On March 30, 2016, the FCC issued a Report and Order (2016 Order) that adopts the following changes to the FUSF for rate-of-return carriers:
 
●         Establishes a voluntary cost model;    
 
●         Creates specific broadband deployment obligations;  
 
●         Provides a mechanism for support of broadband-only deployment;  
 
●         Gradually reduces the authorized rate-of-return from 11.25 percent to 9.75 percent; 
 
●         Eliminates support in those local areas served by unsubsidized competitors;
 
●         Establishes “glide-path” transition periods for all the new changes; and 
 
●         Maintains the $2 billion budget established by the 2011 Transformation Order.
 
While the 2011 FUSF Transformation Order established CAF Phase I and CAF Phase II as high-cost support mechanisms for the price-cap carriers (i.e., the larger, national LECs such as Verizon and AT&T), it was not as specific about how subsidies would change for the rate-of-return carriers (i.e., the smaller LECs, including all rural LECs). In contrast, the 2016 Order focused on the rate-of-return carriers, announced specific changes to existing funding mechanisms as well as a new funding mechanism, and provided rural communications providers with greater certainty about future support. 
 
One of the major changes introduced by the 2016 Order was the creation of the A-CAM, a new CAF support mechanism for rate-of-return carriers. Utilization of the A-CAM was voluntary; and rate-of-return carriers may have instead chose to continue relying on the legacy support mechanism known as interstate common line support, but then modified and renamed CAF Broadband Loop Support. Each carrier needed to decide which support mechanism to elect, and must have chosen one or the other, per state. 
 


On February 25, 2019, the FCC issued Public Notice DA 19-115, which contained revised offers of A-CAM support and associated revised service deployment obligations. On February 27, 2019, the Company’s BOD authorized and directed the Company to accept the FCC’s revised offer of A-CAM support and the revised associated service deployment obligations. Under the revised FCC offer Notice, the Company will be entitled to annually receive (i) $596,084 for its Iowa operations and (ii) $8,354,481 for its Minnesota operations. The Company will receive the revised A-CAM offer over the next 10 years starting in 2019. The Company will use the support that it receives through the A-CAM program to meet its defined broadband build-out obligations, which the Company is currently completing. A letter of acceptance to elect the revised A-CAM support was filed by the Company with the FCC on March 8, 2019. The FCC accepted the Company’s letter on March 11, 2019.  
 
Build-out obligations: A-CAM carriers under the original A-CAM program must complete deployment of 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream service to a number of eligible locations equal to 40 percent of fully funded locations by the end of 2020, to 50 percent of fully funded locations by the end of 2021, to 60 percent of fully funded locations by the end of 2022, to 70 percent of fully funded locations by the end of 2023, to 80 percent of fully funded locations by the end of 2024, to 90 percent of fully funded locations by the end of 2025, and to 100 percent of fully funded locations by the end of 2026. A-CAM carriers who elected additional funding and additional obligations under the revised A-CAM program must complete deployment of 25 Mbps downstream/3 Mbps upstream service to a number of eligible locations equal to 40 percent of fully funded locations by the end of 2022, to 50 percent of fully funded locations by the end of 2023, to 60 percent of fully funded locations by the end of 2024, to 70 percent of fully funded locations by the end of 2025, to 80 percent of fully funded locations by the end of 2026, to 90 percent of fully funded locations by the end of 2027, and to 100 percent of fully funded locations by the end of 2028. As of December 31, 2022, Nuvera has completed the deployment of 10/1 service to 94.6% of its funded locations and 25/3 service to 57.3% of its funded locations in Minnesota, and has completed deployment of 10/1 service to 100% of its funded locations and 25/3 service to 78.2% of its funded locations in Iowa. 

Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
 
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Infrastructure Act) passed on March 31, 2021 and included $65.0 billion toward broadband. The broadband Internet portion of the Infrastructure Act is aimed at increasing Internet coverage for more universal access, including for rural, low-income, and tribal communities. 65% of this funding is set aside specifically for underserved communities. Additionally, this measure is designed to help make Internet access more affordable and increase digital literacy.
 
The Infrastructure Act set aside $42.5 billion for Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment grants. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration administers the grant program and is in the process of soliciting comments before issuing final rules.
 
Privacy and Data Security Regulation
 
The FCA34 generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of communication company customers’ personally identifiable information by communication companies, except for rendering service, conducting legitimate business activities related to the service, and responding to legal requests. We are also subject to various state and federal regulations that provide protections for customer proprietary network information (CPNI) related to our voice services. The FCC expects broadband Internet access service providers such as us to take reasonable, good faith steps to comply with existing statutory requirements to protect broadband CPNI and plans to propose new privacy and data security rules for broadband Internet service providers. The FCC has recently imposed substantial civil penalties and remediation obligations on several companies for alleged privacy and data security violations.
 


The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) exercises authority over privacy protections, generally, using its existing authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices to apply greater restrictions on the collection and use of personally identifiable and other information relating to customers. It also has undertaken numerous enforcement actions against parties that do not provide sufficient security protections against the loss of unauthorized disclosure of this type of information. We also are subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements on website operators and online services. Other privacy-oriented laws have been extended by courts to online video providers and are increasingly being used in privacy lawsuits, including class actions, against providers of video materials online.
 
We are also subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding data security that primarily apply to sensitive personal information that could be used to commit identity theft. Most states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed, due to a security breach, and the FCC has adopted security breach rules for voice services. Several states have also enacted general data security requirements to safeguard consumer information, including the proper disposal of consumer information. 
 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology, in cooperation with other federal agencies and owners and operators of United States critical infrastructure, have developed a voluntary framework that provides a prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based and cost-effective approach to cybersecurity risk. It is compendiums of existing cross-sector cyber-defense processes, practices and protocols that can help companies identify, assess and manage their cyber risks and vulnerabilities, and several governmental agencies have encouraged compliance with this framework. Additionally, in December 2015, Congress enacted the Cybersecurity Act of 2015, which is intended to encourage and facilitate the sharing of security threat and defensive measure information with government agencies and other companies, in order to strengthen the country’s overall cybersecurity protections. Finally, there are pending legislative proposals that could impose new requirements on owners and operators of critical infrastructure and the FCC is considering expanding its cybersecurity guidelines or adopting new cybersecurity requirements. 
 
Network Architecture and Technology
 
We have and plan to continue to make significant investments in our technologically advanced fiber communications networks and continue to enhance and expand our fiber network by deploying technologies to provide additional capacity to our customers. As a result, we are able to deliver high-quality, reliable data, video and voice services in the markets we serve. Our wide-ranging fiber network provides an easy reach into existing and new areas. By bringing the fiber network into the customer premises, we can increase our service offerings, quality and bandwidth services. Our existing fiber network enables us to efficiently respond and adapt to changes in technology and is capable of supporting the rising customer demand for bandwidth in order to support the growing amount of data devices in our customer’s homes and businesses. 
 
Our fiber networks are supported by advanced 100% digital switches, with a core fiber network connecting all of our remote exchanges. We continue to replace our copper cable network to increase bandwidth in order to provide additional products and services to our marketable homes. We are replacing our existing copper cable with fiber cable throughout our network and to all customer premises that take our services, resulting in a 100% fiber network that supports all of the inter-office and host-remote links, as well as all business parks within our service areas that take our service. In addition, this fiber infrastructure provides the connectivity required to provide broadband and long-distance services to our residential and commercial customers. Our fiber network utilizes FTTP and fiber-to-the-node networks to offer residential and commercial services. 
 
We operate advanced fiber networks which we own or have entered into long-term leases for fiber network access. At December 31, 2022, our fiber networks consisted of approximately 2,987 route miles. 
 
At December 31, 2022, we passed 11,133 locations with FTTP. We intend to continue to make strategic enhancements to our fiber network including improvements in overall network reliability and increases to our broadband speeds. We offer data speeds of up to 1 Gbps in select markets, and up to 100 Mbps and 60 Mbps in markets where 1 Gbps is not yet available, depending on the geographical region. 
 


We also provide fixed wireless broadband service to homes and small businesses from 30 towers, six of which we own, with the remaining towers being leased. Thirteen of these towers utilize Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) spectrum. Having secured 21 licenses in twelve CBRS spectrum counties in Minnesota and Iowa. This allows us to offer high-speed Internet to unserved, under-served and hard to serve rural areas. 
 
Environmental Regulation
 
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials, the release of pollutants into the environment and the remediation of contamination. We could be subject to environmental laws that impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup at a contaminated site, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the activity that resulted in contamination. We believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Employees
 
As of March 1, 2023 we had 202 full-time equivalent employees dedicated to Nuvera’s operations. In addition, as of March 1, 2023 we had an additional 9 full-time equivalent employees that are employed by Nuvera but are dedicated to IES. IES is a minority equity subsidiary of Nuvera and Nuvera acts as the managing entity for IES.
Intellectual Property
 
Intellectual property is necessary for our operations but is not material to our overall operations.
