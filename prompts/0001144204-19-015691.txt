Item 1.              Business
Overview
 
We are a leading global Digital Therapeutics (DTx) company revolutionizing the way people manage their health across the chronic condition spectrum. By delivering evidence-based interventions that are driven by data, high quality software and coaching, we developed a novel approach that empowers individuals to adjust their lifestyle in a personalized way. Our cross -functional team operates at the intersection of biology, behavioral science and software technology to deliver highly engaging therapeutic interventions. Already the highest rated diabetes solution by more than tens of thousands of consumers who love our user-centered approach, DarioHealth is rapidly moving into new chronic conditions and geographic markets.
 
Our flagship product, Dario, which we also refer to as our Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution, is a mobile, real-time, cloud-based, diabetes management solution based on an innovative, multi-feature software application to track and monitor all facets of diabetes, combined with a stylish, ‘all-in-one’, pocket-sized, blood glucose monitoring device, which we call the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System, that essentially turns a smartphone into a glucometer. In addition, our product offerings will focus on the newly launched DarioEngage software platform, where we, or any care giver, can digitally engage with Dario users, assist them in monitoring their chronic conditions and provide them with coaching, support, digital communications, and real-time alerts, trends and pattern analysis. The DarioEngage platform can be leveraged by our potential partners, such as clinics, health care service providers, employers, and payers for scalable monitoring of people with diabetes in a cost-effective manner, which we expect will open for us additional revenue streams. Finally, we intend to utilize the data we obtain from our Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution and the DarioEngage platform to develop our upcoming healthcare analytics program, Dario Intelligence, which will provide our users with evidence-based therapeutic intervention to assist them and enhance their diabetes management skills. As such, our solutions will span the full spectrum of disease monitoring, real-time response, user-centric engagement, motivational tools, nutritional data and content, coaching tools, and big data and intelligence solutions. We have obtained regulatory clearance or approval for the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System in the U.S., Canada, the E.U., Israel and Australia. We believe that our targeted health platform is a highly personalized preventative and proactive approach to health improvement based on individual behavior and treatment, that provides care independent of a user’s schedule and in their private environment, tailored to each person’s unique profile.
 
Our principal operating subsidiary, LabStyle Innovation Ltd., is an Israeli company with its headquarters in Caesarea, Israel. We were formed on August 11, 2011, as a Delaware corporation with the name LabStyle Innovations Corp. On July 28, 2016, we changed our name to DarioHealth Corp.
 
Diabetes is a disease where insufficient levels, or a total absence, of the hormone insulin, or if the individual has insulin resistance, produces high levels of glucose in the bloodstream, which can lead to long term adverse effects on a patient’s blood vessels, which in turn can lead to heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, blindness, kidney disease and nerve damage. As part of controlling blood sugar, many patients must self-monitor their blood glucose levels using home testing kits (called glucose meters) and treat high and low blood sugar episodes accordingly to avoid the complications from the disease. We believe that allowing patients to properly monitor the disease, provide actionable insights in real-time and create an online link to healthcare providers, will ultimately improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs - both critical advantages for the healthcare industry.
 
The latest studies released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that in 2015 over 30.3 million Americans have diabetes. More alarming is that in 2015, an addition 84.1 million Americans age 18 or older have what is known as prediabetes, which when left unmanaged will most likely become diabetes in a matter of a few years. The number of people with diabetes or prediabetes equates to 35% of the adult population in the U.S. In addition, there is a strong correlation between obesity and the development of diabetes. Many believe, including the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), that diabetes is one of the worst epidemics of the 21st century. The diabetes epidemic is not only felt in terms of its impact on health but also represents a financial burden on the U.S. and global healthcare system.

Importantly, one out of three American adults with prediabetes can, in fact, reverse the condition if they take action, and the health of people with diabetes can be improved through measurement adherence and medication. Furthermore, studies have shown that a 1% reduction in the concentration of glycated hemoglobin (also known as HbA1c or A1c) in human blood goes beyond better diabetes control. That reduction may translate into a 15% to 20% decrease in heart attack and stroke risk and a 25% to 40% lower risk of diabetes-related eye or kidney disease. Better diabetes management may result in substantial savings in the costs related to diabetes and healthcare in general, through the avoidance of health complications and related expense savings. A 2013 NCBI study found that improved A1c levels are associated with healthcare savings.
 
Based on data we have extracted from our user database, using the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution leads to an improvement in glucose level of the users and lowers their A1c levels over time. This data also indicated that higher engagement of users with the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution increased the level of A1c improvement. Specifically, we found A1c improvements during a period of 3 months, 6 months, and 9-months for people who began the study with A1c levels of more than 8%, 9%, and 10%. The key finding was that, on average, every segment of the users showed an improvement compared to their A1c level when they started to use the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution, while 75% of participants which started to use the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution with A1c levels higher than 9% were able to lower their A1cC levels during that period with as little as 3 glucose level measurements per day.
 
Beginning in September 2013, the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution has been reviewed and approved or cleared by various global regulatory authorities. We received the CE Mark in 2013 which allowed the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution to be marketed and sold in 32 countries across Europe as well as in certain other countries worldwide. This clearance was followed by approval received from Israel’s Ministry of Health in July 2014, and we received Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) certification to market the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution in Australia in December 2014, followed by approval from Health Canada in May 2015.
 
In December 2015, we announced that we received 510(k) clearance for the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including its components, and the Dario Smart Diabetes Management app on the Apple iOS 6.1 platform and higher. Achieving FDA clearance was a significant milestone and we commenced marketing and commercialization of the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution in the United States in the first quarter of 2016. On September 7, 2017, we announced that the FDA granted 510(k) clearance for the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System to be used with certain leading Android smart mobile devices. This FDA clearance allowed us to widen our potential customer base in the United States commencing in the last quarter of 2017.
 
During 2017, we completed the development of a version of the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System that connects to an iPhone 7 through the Lightning connector, which we refer to as our Lightning meter, instead of the eliminated 3.5 mm audio jack. On May 18, 2017, we completed the Notice of Change for the CE Mark for the Apple Lightning connector to connect to Apple smart mobile devices that do not come with 3.5 mm audio jack. Additionally, we have registered with the TGA in Australia for the Lightning-enabled Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Sales of this version of the device in Australia commenced during January 2018. In March 2018, we received FDA clearance to market this version of the device in the U.S.
 
We intend to continue to generate demand through a digital direct-to-consumer marketing campaign. Customers are currently able to purchase the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System directly through our proprietary e-store where they can also subscribe to a subscription-based service. In July 2016, we signed an agreement with GEMCO Medical, an established healthcare distributor and a pioneer in the diabetes supply industry, to become the first authorized United States distributor of the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System and to complement our direct-to-consumer model to further expand and strengthen its presence in the United States. Also during July 2016, we launched our Australian proprietary e-store where customers may subscribe to a subscription-based service, and in September 2017 we launched our proprietary e-store in Germany offering our product to customers in Germany.

Although we are initially targeting only the large and growing Blood Glucose Monitoring System, or BGMS, market, we believe our invention has the potential to cover dozens of laboratory tests of bodily fluids (including blood, urine, and saliva) that could potentially be undertaken using a smart mobile device, including blood coagulation, cholesterol, HIV and others. Our goal is to develop additional interfaces for other chronic illnesses and health conditions, thereby empowering people around the globe to put themselves in control of managing their medical conditions while leveraging our platform. By doing so, we believe that we will be positioned to make a dramatic impact on the lives of millions of people that face daily lifestyle and medical challenges. Our technology provides a body-fluid testing apparatus for performing metered measurement of samples utilizing: (i) a lancing device to obtain a test sample (blood in the case of the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System); and (ii) an adaptor specifically designed to connect a strip devised to absorb the sample, which then produces an electric signal indicating the level of the substance tested for in the sample. The adaptor is then connected to a smart mobile device via the 3.5 mm audio jack or Lightning connector, which allows the test signal to be transmitted to the smart mobile device, which will then utilize our software application to obtain and display the test result on the device. This is coupled with a set of software features available via a smart mobile device application as well as cloud-based services, in real-time. We are presently pursuing patent applications in multiple jurisdictions covering the specific processes related to blood glucose level measurement as well as more general methods of rapid tests of body fluids using mobile devices and cloud-based services. On August 5, 2014, we were issued a U.S. patent (No. 8,797,180) relating to how the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System draws power from and transmits data to a smartphone via the audio jack port, on September 8, 2015, we were issued a U.S. patent (No. 9,125,549) that broadens our registered patent No. 8,797,180 to include testing of other bodily fluids through an audio jack connection, and on November 11, 2017, we were issued a U.S. patent (No. 9,832,301) that enhances the way the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System communicates with users’ smartphone devices. We believe these represent critical intellectual property recognition and a significant initial validation of our intellectual property efforts.
 
DarioHealth’s Solutions
 
Our DTx products are centered around our users and include the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System, the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution (provided to our users in the form of a smart phone application that enables the delivery of valuable content and periodical evidence based reports that are intended to be utilized by our users to better control and improve their diabetes), the DarioEngage platform (which provides support and two-way real time connectivity between our users and their care givers) and Dario Intelligence (which utilizes user data and is intended to be an analytics tool that can assist healthcare providers in the treatments and predictability of diseases).
 
Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution 
 
The Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System is the original, all-in-one smart glucose meter. It syncs with the Dario Smart Diabetes Management app to measure, record and track blood glucose levels. In addition, the app records carbohydrate intake, insulin medication, and physical activity.
 
The flagship brand of DarioHealth, the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution, was initially launched in the United Kingdom in the first quarter of 2015 and has since expanded to Canada, Australia, the United States, and Germany. We earn a majority of our revenues in the United States. We manufacture our products using subcontractors and distribute our proprietary device ourselves. We believe this control over end to end production allows us to maintain high standards of quality control. To that end, we are the owner of several patents relating to our technology and processes.
 
We use our patented technology to enhance the way our Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System communicates with users’ smartphone devices. In the U.S. market, the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System connects to a smartphone via a sugar-cube dongle that does not require a battery for operation; rather, it relies on the smartphone’s battery as its power source. In the effort to reduce battery-dependence and ensure 100% real-time data capture, the application is able to monitor and adjust power levels on smartphones accordingly to enable sufficient output with minimal reliance.
 
The benefits and features of our product include:

During the second half of 2018, we have begun to offer our U.S. users the opportunity to register for our membership programs by purchasing 3 month and 1 year membership plans. In addition to our products, these plans include an unlimited supply of test strips, subject to the user’s active measurement of his glucose level, and a weekly digital progress report about the user’s measurements, in order to help the users understand the progress made in their diabetes management. Our members are also provided with personalized diabetes programs – including lifestyle changes, healthy eating and advanced tracking, and live coaching seminars.
 
In addition, we anticipate generating revenues in the future from our second revenue pillar that we call the DarioEngage platform, our software platform for health coaches. We plan to offer this software platform to healthcare providers such as insurers, self-insured employers, diabetes clinics, certified diabetes educators and other third-party providers of coaching and monitoring services for people with diabetes for a monthly service fee. Our third revenue pillar, which we are planning to introduce at a later stage, is the Dario Intelligence platform. The Dario Intelligence platform will take advantage of a large amount of data that will be collected through our servers through the use of our Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution and the DarioEngage platform, in order to develop predictive models and artificial intelligence algorithms as detailed below.
 
We believe the following features of our Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution and the manner in which we plan to market and distribute the product will help position Dario to gain users and drive revenue growth:
 

● | Look and Feel. While utilizing the same state of the art electrochemical, blood-based measurement techniques as standard glucose monitors offer familiar usability, the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System is easily integrated with the patient’s own smart mobile device that offers a distinctive look and feel. Furthermore, unlike the market standards, the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System has an integrated lancing device and a disposable strip cartridge. This eliminates the need for a separate glucose monitor, lancing device and strip vial and, we believe, makes the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System among the smallest footprint in the market. Furthermore, Dario has novel applications incorporating software tools to help diabetic patients manage their disease. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Large Market of Potential Users. Our reliance on diabetics within the massive smart mobile device market gives us an established potential user-base. According to recently published Mobile Fact Sheet by Pew Research Center, or PRC, 81% of Americans own a smartphone, up just 35% in PRC’s first survey of smartphone ownership conducted in 2011. Between the ages of 18 to 34, 95% have a smartphone, and between the age of 34 to 49, 92% own a smartphone. We believe that it is reasonable to assume that the percentage of smart mobile device users with diabetes mirrors that of the general population. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Marketing and Distribution. In the U.S., Germany, and Australia we have our own direct to consumer marketing channel to support our sales efforts. In the U.S. we also plan to contract with partners to provide coaching services to employers and health care providers. In the United Kingdom and Canada, we use distribution partners to market and sell the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System. This approach enables a direct communication channel with the market and the diabetic community. This approach is also designed to effectively create brand awareness with a significantly reduced use of our capital resources versus the amounts required via the traditional, offline retail channels. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | “Expanding the Pie.” Our goal is to obtain significant market share using technological innovations and by expanding the total BGMS market size “pie” by offering a user-friendly diabetes management solution that utilizes an existing platform and installed potential user base (smart mobile devices and smart mobile device users, respectively). We will endeavor to emphasize the user-friendly nature of the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution to expand the total BGMS market size by encouraging existing diabetes patients to test their glucose levels more frequently and by encouraging the “non-testing” population to adopt glucose monitoring. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competitive Cost of Goods Sold. Based on our market research and discussions with our test strip manufacturer, we believe that our anticipated outsourced manufacturing cost of the test strips is similar to our estimate of our competitors’ cost for existing single-use disposable strips. In addition, we believe the manufacturing costs of our Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System are competitive with those of the leading glucose meters. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Opportunities for Commercialization Partnerships. Healthcare and pharmaceutical company entrants into the BGMS market (such as Perrigo and Sanofi) are licensing and/or acquiring technologies, seeking differentiation, thereby providing us with opportunities for more rapid commercialization through partnerships. Therefore, we plan to explore the possibility of entering into commercialization agreements, including upfront payment, a supply agreement, and royalty payments, with strategic partners. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Currently, there are a few new market entrants in the BGMS space that are attempting to utilize computer or smart mobile device connectivity, including Sanofi iBGStar, Medisana GlucoDock, Philosys Gmate Smart, One Drop, and iHealth Align. We believe that none of these devices offer the integration of an all-in-one unit that includes a lancing device and strip cartridge as the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System does. We further believe that these competitors provide limited capabilities over their diabetes management apps as compared to the Dario Smart Diabetes Management application.
 
In summary, we believe we bring an entirely new dynamic to the BGMS device market.  We believe that our primary business model for the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution is clean and simple - sales of proprietary glucose test strips (the disposable component) directly to consumers, leveraging an installed base of mobile phones. The entire mechanism consists of a small and simple adaptor combined with a strip which is connected to the smart mobile device’s headphone jack, or Lightning connector, with the strip test results being read by the smart mobile device.
 
We also believe that this business model is the foundation for a broader push to improve the health care system. An application that is always in your pocket and used multiple times per day is an ideal platform to support people living with diabetes, their health care providers, and health systems. Our application is designed to improve health outcomes and reduce costs through increased insights, motivating tools and automation.
 
DarioEngage
 
DarioEngage represents our new customer engagement management software platform, which is intended to help healthcare providers in all aspects of user engagement, including enrollment, coaching and ongoing communications with the end-users based on user consent. DarioEngage was developed in order to allow for a one stop scalable management tool to improve efficacy and outcomes of caregivers. We believe that DarioEngage will assist healthcare providers and employers by offering them an open platform, thereby empowering them to implement their own clinical expertise in a more digital, user-centric and efficient way. We believe this approach can address two burgeoning issues: improving the quality of health for individuals, which in turn will lower healthcare costs across the spectrum.
 
The DarioEngage platform empowers health providers offering diabetes services with:
 

· | Monitoring - 100% data capture, access to users’ real-time clinical and behavioral data 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Engagement - Personalized coaching in response to users’ habits and needs, response to user events, and enhanced communication and support 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Management - Clinical program integration, automated processes, scheduling tools and reporting 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The DarioEngage platform provides care givers with real-time access to data collected by a user such as, glucose level, carb counting, physical activity, weight tracking and other parameters. Such access allows care givers to prioritize user intervention based on real-time data and alerts and allows for multi-channel digital interaction with the user (chat, in-app messages, email and text). DarioEngage is a cloud-based SaaS solution that also includes open APIs for platform integration.
 
We believe that the DarioEngage platform is a user-centric, data-driven health solution which allows people with Diabetes to get the right care, at the right time, and allows for the effective monitoring, coaching and management of their chronic conditions, such as type 1 and 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, and prediabetes.

Dario Intelligence
 
The last pillar in our planned suite of product offerings is Dario Intelligence. We are planning to offer Dario Intelligence, which utilizes the large amount of data that will be collected on our servers through the use of our Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution and the DarioEngage platform, to develop predictive models and artificial intelligence algorithms to meet the potential demand of intelligence-driven analytics that healthcare providers will be looking to improve their services.
 
We believe the future development of Dario Intelligence will present an opportunity in the chronic disease management field and will help us leverage our data capturing platform, to be used for big data analytics, research, EMRs (Electronic Medical Record) / EHRs (Electronic Health Records), and the development of real-time and predictive-based health management solutions.
 

· | Data Collection - Real-time data collections and aggregation 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Analytics - Dario big data analytics solution
--+----------------------------------------------


· | Discovery - Data discovery and analysis
--+----------------------------------------


· | Insights - Predictive models and AI driven insights
--+----------------------------------------------------

 
Through Dario Intelligence, we believe we may be able to develop innovative artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches that will enable us to transform big data into individual and specific predictive models to meet the demands of both consumers and the health care providers. We believe that by coupling data and algorithmic development, Dario Intelligence may offer in the future the way to detect, predict and intervene most effectively for each individual using our platform.
 
Our Vision for Dario Intelligence
 
We intend to offer solutions built from a foundation of rich and robust data, ultimately transforming our revenue model from simple product volume to product value. We believe that the current ineffective care of diabetes and other chronic conditions reflects a need for more intelligent and nuanced approaches relating to predictive behaviors and real-time care. We believe that financial incentives tied to patient outcomes have the potential to generate sizeable revenue growth for us and position us as a leader in transforming the management of diabetes. Achieving the strategic vision of Dario Intelligence requires multiple steps and evolutions in order to harness the power from the data generated by a connected community, and subsequently impact individual behavior.
Phase 1 – Collect & Analyze
 
As the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution user-base has grown, we have collected a significant amount of user data and information. Initial efforts in Phase 1 are centered around an understanding of our user-base. Compiling basic demographic data such as age, gender, country geography, etc., and establishing links to test strip usage and blood glucose control are critically important. Further, examining variation amongst population cohorts in both utilization and blood glucose outcomes is fundamental to future targeting and retention campaigns. We intend to generate analytical insights on individuals who achieve improvement in blood glucose levels in order to develop an in-depth understanding of those who maintain such an improvement over time, which we believe will form the backbone of interventional program development that we intend to generate with our potential partners.
Phase 2 – Expand Collection of Data Types, Experiment with Outreach Campaigns
 
As continued growth of users accelerates globally, concerted efforts will be undertaken at expanding the collection of highly relevant data types. In addition, we intend to expand data collection on user data points such as carbohydrate intake, exercise, and physical activity, medication and medication adherence, GPS location, time stamps, insurance coverage type/status. When more data elements are gathered, the intention is for Dario Intelligence to apply its artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to enhance understanding of individuals and detailed profiles that will be generated with comprehensive user information such as the type of advertising that was used to recruit patients or how frequently an individual interacts with the Dario Smart Diabetes Management app. The result is intended to be a cohort-specific predictive model that can be used to develop interventional programs on a wide basis.

Phase 3 – Monetize De-Identified Data, Learn, Expand Intervention Programs
 
We believe that pharmaceutical companies, device manufacturers, insurers, governments, researchers, advertisers, and start-up companies would be willing to pay for the de-identified data that we will obtain through our Dario Intelligence platform. As such, we believe there is an opportunity to develop a consistent revenue stream from this data.
 
In addition to data that reports on the activity and performance of the population as a whole, we believe that will be able to provide access to a globally connected community of patients and consumers. We are planning to monetize access to specific patient cohorts, designing programs to improve utilization, engagement, and outcomes. These future programs will be adapted, modified, and enhanced based on continuous learning and additional data inputs from external third parties that we are planning to engage with in the future. Pay for performance models will be developed and experimented with, as we will implement next-generation artificial intelligence and machine learning programs designed to influence user’s behavior.
 
Background on Diabetes
 
Diabetes is a chronic disease that arises when the pancreas does not produce enough (or ceases to produce) insulin, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces (insulin resistance). Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that enables cells to take in glucose from the blood and use it for energy. Failure to produce insulin, or of insulin to act properly, or both, leads to raised glucose (sugar) levels in the blood (hyperglycemia), which can be detected with a blood test. Excess glucose in the blood has been shown to cause damage to blood vessels and is thus associated with long-term damage to the body and failure of various organs and tissues, including the retina and the kidneys. There are three main types of diabetes:
 
Type 1 diabetes, sometimes called insulin-dependent, or juvenile, diabetes, is caused by an auto-immune reaction where the body’s defense system attacks the insulin-producing cells located in a person’s pancreas.  The reason why this occurs is not fully understood.  People with Type 1 diabetes produce very little or no insulin.  The disease can affect people of any age but usually occurs in children or young adults.  People with this form of diabetes need injections or infusions of insulin several times a day in order to control the levels of glucose in their blood. The use of insulin may lead to excessively low levels of glucose in the blood, also known as hypoglycemia, leading to other health problems. Type 1 diabetes patients constitute approximately 10% of the overall number of patients, but are much more extensive users of BGMS, as these diabetics need to measure their glucose levels 4-10 times a day to avoid both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia (versus once or twice a day for most Type 2 non-insulin dependent diabetic patients). The vast majority of Type 1 diabetes patients are insulin dependent.
 
Type 2 diabetes is sometimes called adult-onset diabetes and accounts for at least 90% of all cases of diabetes.  It is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, either of which may be present at the time that diabetes becomes clinically manifest. The diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes usually occurs after the age of 40 but can occur earlier, especially in populations with high diabetes incidence.  Type 2 diabetes can remain undetected for many years, and the diagnosis is often made from associated complications or incidentally through abnormal blood or urine glucose test.  It is often, but not always, associated with obesity, which may contribute to insulin resistance and lead to elevated blood glucose levels.  A portion of the Type 2 diabetes patients are insulin dependent or use insulin as part of their treatment.
 
Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a form of diabetes consisting of high blood glucose levels during pregnancy.  It develops in one in 25 pregnancies worldwide and is associated with complications in the time period immediately before and after birth.  GDM usually disappears after pregnancy but women with GDM and their offspring are at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life.  Approximately half of women with a history of GDM go on to develop Type 2 diabetes within five to ten years after delivery.

We also believe we will be able to support patients with pre-diabetes, also called metabolic syndrome.  Metabolic syndrome is a combination of medical disorders that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes.  According to the American Diabetes Association, in 2015, 84.1 million Americans age 18 and older had pre-diabetes. This population is typically prescribed with periodic lab-based glucose level testing (which requires a doctor visit, significantly reducing the compliance level) and typically does not involve the utilization of self-monitoring glucose devices.
 
The Diabetes and BGMS Markets and the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution 
 
Diabetes is a growing epidemic for which no cure exists, but for which treatments (including a regimen of frequent blood glucose testing) are available.  The medical journal Lancet has reported that the number of worldwide diabetics has doubled over the past thirty years.  While about 70% of the increase has been attributed in the Lancet report to population growth and aging, the balance was linked to changing diets, rising obesity levels, and less physical activity.
 
According to the information published in 2017 by the International Diabetes Foundation (IDF), in its 8th edition of the “IDF Diabetes Atlas,” approximately 425 million people worldwide were estimated to have diabetes in 2017, or one in eleven adults worldwide. The greatest numbers are between 40 and 59 years old. If these trends continue, by 2045, some 629 million people are forecasted by the IDF to have diabetes. According to the IDF Diabetes Atlas, in Europe, there were 58 million adults over the age of 20 with diabetes in 2017 and approximately 30.2 million adults over the age of 20 with diabetes in the U.S. in 2017.  As of 2017, approximately 187 million adults with diabetes live in China and India, with approximately 12.4 million in Brazil and 8.5 million in Russia.
 
It is estimated that the costs of diabetes complications account for between 5% and 10% of total healthcare spending in the world. In the United States, the ADA estimated that the total cost of diagnosed diabetes has risen from $174 billion in 2007 to $245 billion in 2012. Early diagnosis of warning signs and ongoing monitoring of diabetes are the keys to the prevention and treatment of the disease, with blood glucose monitoring being the primary method of diagnosis and disease management, coupled with matching blood glucose readings with food (i.e., carbohydrate) and insulin or another medication intake.
 
Since blood glucose self-monitoring is a key part of managing diabetes, the market for BGMS products required to service these many patients is also large. As reported in a press release published by Allied Market Research, the blood glucose self-monitoring market was estimated to be $7.76 billion in 2017 and is expected to grow to an estimated $10.82 billion by 2025.   The biggest drivers for growth in the diabetes device market will be the increased prevalence and awareness of diabetes.  The U.S. is the largest market, contributing close to 40% of the global market for these devices. 
 
Key factors driving market growth include an increasing number of people with diabetes, growing patient awareness, technological advancements and the increasing number of patients adopting blood glucose self-monitoring.  In addition, the affordable cost of blood glucose test strips, and increase in daily monitoring, are also expected to contribute to market growth.  As such, BGMS represents a large market that has grown significantly over the past 30 years and is expected to continue to grow.
 
It is important to note that the diabetic market is the first point of entry for the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution and we believe that our goal of providing mHealth health solutions for a variety of chronic and wellness related conditions based on mobile device testing will grant us access to a much larger market. The Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution is targeted at the digital health market, which was estimated by Zion Market Research at around $122 billion globally in 2017, and is expected to reach $423 billion by 2024.
 
Industry Background and the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution Opportunity
 
From a competition perspective, four companies currently dominate the BGMS business, controlling a majority of the market: Roche Diagnostics (part of Hoffman-LaRoche), LifeScan (a Johnson & Johnson company), Ascensia (formerly Diabetes care), and Abbott Laboratories.  These “big four” offer a wide variety of BGMS products and have led the market since the late 1990s. Numerous second-tier and third-tier competitors, including several in Asia, hold the remaining 10% of the market. We believe that the BGMS offerings by all vendors are comparable, with mild differentiation of the main feature sets of the devices.  This is akin to the differentiation among personal computers (PCs) during the 1990s and 2000s, where most of them had the same key feature set of Microsoft Windows and Intel Processors.

We believe that the increasing global adoption of mobile phones has created an opportunity for disruption in the BGMS market. The Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution, which features our compact all-in-one Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System device coupled with iOS, Android and web-based apps, is intended to eliminate the need for separate glucose monitors, carb-calculators and cumbersome dependency on wired, computer-based logging tools.  Our intention is for Dario to not only deliver the best blood glucose monitoring experience but also use the unique capabilities of mobile smart mobile devices to deliver better health outcomes.
 
With respect to the U.S. BGMS market, the principal barriers to entry (all of which we believe the features of the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution can overcome) can be summarized as follows:
 

● | Achieving significant product differentiation in the eyes of diabetes patients or insurance payers. We believe that Dario offers a novel design that is compatible with the usability of the current devices yet offers a modern look and feel when compared to products in the marketplace. Marketing of the product directly to consumers will emphasize the product’s distinguishing attributes, without incurring the significant product introduction expenses typically incurred for the marketing of a standard glucose meter via traditional retail channels. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Costs. We anticipate that low manufacturing costs for the dongle (the part of the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System that attaches to the phone jack or Lightning connector) and the similarity to our competitors’ estimated cost of manufacturing the strips, when coupled with our direct-to-consumer marketing, creates the potential for providing us with a meaningful cost advantage versus most vendors of traditional glucose meters. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Difficulty obtaining shelf space at the pharmacy. With many products on the market, a new entrant has to battle for visibility on the shelf or in e-commerce stores. The Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution will limit this obstacle by emphasizing internet based direct-to-consumer marketing and sales. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The challenge of influencing diabetes specialists to recommend another BGMS product to patients. We make efforts to introduce and present the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution to the medical community through our participation in academic and professional conferences. The Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution will continue to be marketed directly to our target users (“Business to Consumer,” or B2C), who we believe are increasingly becoming the primary decision-makers in choosing their glucose monitoring equipment. We have also started marketing our products in a “Business-to-Business,” or B2B, business model, selling to large organizations that include distributors, retailers, pharmacies and hospitals. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that Dario’s specific features and trends in the marketplace create a significant opportunity to penetrate the market and effectively compete with and gain market share against the established players.
 
Utilization of Mobile Health Applications
 
Smart mobile device applications combine easy-to-use interfaces with continuous internet access to create transformational mobile health solutions (often called mHealth, eHealth or digital health).  Although the potential benefits of mHealth solutions have been widely discussed for over a decade, the market is now starting to emerge from the trial phase. The need to reduce long waiting periods in order to access health care facilities from specialists is the primary driver responsible for the adoption of mHealth. We believe that Dario is designed to play directly into this market trend.
 
In addition, the Grand View Research report states that the availability of applications for consumers is continuing to grow rapidly, especially healthcare apps. These applications assist users in self-management of wellness, disease and chronic abnormalities. This has led to the patient playing an important and active role in staying informed and updated on their own healthcare decisions, contributing to the rise in adoption of mHealth apps globally.

Healthcare is gradually transitioning towards a precision-based model, better known as a “personalized medicine” model. mHealth is becoming a widespread trend due to the introduction of technologies such as electronic medical records, remote monitoring, and other communication platforms. mHealth leverages the 4Ps of healthcare delivery: personalized, predictive, participatory, and preventive, to ensure delivery of optimal care to its users. In addition, the growing penetration of smartphones, especially in low- & middle-income countries and the growing focus on utilizing mobile technology to leverage healthcare delivery and ensure a population health plan is anticipated to benefit the market.
 
The Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution includes the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System and software application for people with diabetes. Dario currently allows users to easily record, analyze, transmit and store key data points such as glucose level, insulin, and carbohydrate intake. Moreover, the Dario Smart Diabetes Management application provides knowledge and motivation with the aim of improving health outcomes. In addition, we are developing software for health care providers and payers to help better support patients and intelligently manage large patient populations.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our initial marketing efforts in the United States were focused on the early adopter users who have diabetes and who are paying out of pocket for their monitoring tools to manage their chronic condition, and we have concentrated our efforts in gaining market share and brand awareness through direct to consumer marketing efforts.
 
In 2018, we began to expand our marketing efforts to the insured population by offering our DarioEngage platform to a variety of healthcare providers who are supporting and coaching individuals with diabetes. We believe this will help us to diversify our revenues, from only selling our Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System and its consumables, to revenues generated from providing online real-time monitoring, supervising and coaching capabilities to all relevant healthcare providers who support individuals with diabetes. As part of these efforts, we recently announced our planned cooperation with Attain Health, Giant Eagle, BestBuy, Canadian-based LMC Healthcare and Better Living Now (BLN).
 
In Australia, we revised our sales and marketing strategy during the third quarter of 2016 and moved to a hybrid direct to consumer model in combination with an on the ground out-sourced channel sales organization staff focused on the pharmacies. This model will allow us to accelerate our penetration into this market while building a diabetes community via direct engagement through our digital marketing campaigns and online store.
 
In the U.K., the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System is a fully reimbursed product distributed by a new distributor since the second quarter of 2016. The Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System is now available via all main pharmacies in the U.K. Our sales and marketing efforts have been focused on wholesalers, pharmacies, HCP’s (Health Care Professionals), diabetes educators and hospitals via the distributor. This has created awareness and understanding of the value proposition we offer to people with diabetes. In addition, we will be focusing on increasing our presence in the U.K. market via our direct to consumer strategy, utilizing the countrywide availability of the strips in pharmacy and clinical awareness of the product via the healthcare providers.
 
In Canada, the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System is available through major pharmacy chains across Canada that includes brands like London Drugs. We also offer consumers the ability to buy direct via our online platform or to get their prescriptions serviced online via Bayshore. Similar to the U.K., in Canada, we work on both promoting and marketing Dario to the medical establishment via our distributor and expanding its awareness via our direct to consumer strategy which we have been ramping up.
 
On the marketing side, we primarily utilize online marketing in order to create awareness of Dario. Rather than solely rely on an online advertisement, we will also consider revenue sharing with affiliate networks and a variety of other pay-for-performance methods commonly used in online commerce.

As a precursor to the DarioEngage platform, in December 2014, we entered into an agreement with Israel's leading healthcare HMO, Maccabi Healthcare, to implement a comprehensive digital suite for patients and professionals. The agreement with MOMA (Maccabi TeleCare unit) represented the beginning of an additional revenue channel. We believe the DarioEngage channel for revenues presents a significant potential based on software licensing and added value services with HMOs and other strategic partners worldwide. The Dario application for MOMA is a proprietary customized diabetes management solution that enables remote treatment for diabetes which aims to improve overall outcomes for patients leveraging mHealth technology for effective engagement of health care professionals.
 
We also expect to collaborate with the medical community to showcase what we expect will be the Dario Smart Diabetes Management Solution’s clinical equivalence and usability superiority through DarioEngage and Dario Intelligence.
 
Manufacturing
 
As we do not directly manufacture our products ourselves, we have supply agreements with manufacturers for the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System, glucose test strips, lancing devices, and lancets.  We have arrangements in place with commercial-scale manufacturers for both the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System and for our test strips. As a result of investments we have made over the past several years, we own the specialized equipment used to manufacture Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
 
During 2015, we commenced the manufacturing of our Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System with a Chinese manufacturer as part of our efforts to further reduce manufacturing cost. At the beginning of 2016, we transitioned our manufacturing to a new Chinese manufacturer as part of our effort to increase our manufacturing capacity and improve cost savings.
 
Insurance Reimbursement
 
In the United States and in other jurisdictions such as Germany and England, we expect that Dario’s test strips should generally be available for full or partial patient reimbursement by third-party payers.  We expect to work with third-party payers in the countries into which we expect to market Dario in order to establish coverage for test strips, although we cannot be sure of coverage being obtained.  In April 2014, we announced the receipt of reimbursement coverage for the use of the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System in Italy, making 600,000 Italians eligible for reimbursement coverage. In June 2014, we were granted (effective September 1, 2014) reimbursement status in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland for strips and lancets to be utilized together with the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System. In December 2014, we were granted reimbursement status for the Dario test strips Australia. In May 2015 we launched Dario in Canada and the majority of Canadian medical plans are now covering test strips for the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System with reimbursement. We expect the balance of Canadian insurance plans to provide reimbursement coverage in the near future. We are planning to pursue reimbursement coverage in other jurisdictions.
Clinical Trials
 
As part of our CE Mark clearance, in 2013 we conducted positive User Performance studies for the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System in Israel with 161 diabetic patients. This study aimed to collect measurement data from capillary blood with a defined distribution of glucose concentrations in order to perform system accuracy evaluation according to ISO 15197:2013, the current international standard requirements for BGMS systems. The results of this study showed that the test strips are well within limits for system accuracy defined by ISO 15197:2013 in that 100% of results fell within zones A and B of the Consensus Error Grid for all systems, which means that the system accuracy requirements of the ISO 15197:2013 have been met. The acceptance criteria for accuracy of BGMS per ISO 15197:2013 is “95 % of the individual glucose measured values shall fall within ± 0,83 mmol/l (±15 mg/dl) of the measured values of the manufacturer’s measurement procedure at glucose concentrations < 5,55 mmol/l (<100 mg/dl) and within ± 15% at glucose concentrations ≥ 5,55 mmol/l (≥100 mg/dl)”.

In January 2015, we completed, and in March 2015, we announced positive results from, a required User Performance evaluation study in the U.S. to evaluate the accuracy of blood glucose level results obtained from fingertip using the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System compared to reference equipment (YSI 2300 STATPLUS) and to evaluate the ease of use of the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System by the first time user.  This study was in connection with our regulatory submissions for the product in the U.S. and Canada and accordance with ISO 15197:2013.  The study was performed at Remington Davis Clinical Research in Columbus, Ohio with the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System and included 368 participants with varying demographics.  As required by the FDA, the study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) which supervises the clinical studies performed in their institutions.
 
The purpose of the study was to demonstrate the accuracy of the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System compared with the Yellow Springs Instruments (“YSI”) reference standard and to evaluate how the first time users of the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System (1) use it under the Dario guidance materials (i.e., quick user guide and video clip) in an effort to demonstrate how the use of the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System and related software could potentially improve patient care and diabetic compliance, (2) to understand the potential weaknesses of the device and introduce methods of overcoming them to the users and (3) to establish the proposition that lay users can operate the device.
 
We evaluated the accuracy and user performance in this clinical trial with 368 diabetic patients, each of whom tested fresh capillary finger prick blood glucose levels while using the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System for the first time, as instructed by Dario's instruction material. System accuracy was determined with samples obtained from each subject measured both on the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System by individual subjects and by a reference YSI analyzer. We documented sample collection or measurement errors. When required, repeated sampling by each subject was limited to three per subject. The interval of glucose levels tested was within BGMS range 43.0-477.0 mg/dL, and YSI range 42.3-435.5 mg/dL. There were no outliers. Accuracy for the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System met ISO 15197:2013 criteria, as can be seen in the accuracy tables below. Below 100 mg/dL, 97.8% of values were within ±15mg/d of YSI reference glucose values. For samples with glucose above or equal to 100 mg/dL, 96.4% of values were within ± 15% of YSI glucose levels. Lay subject performance assessment of Dario’s instruction clarity and usefulness showed that 100% successfully obtained a measurement result, and 97.1% of subjects found instructions easy to follow with 70.7% rating they were very satisfied (5/5) and 26.4% rating they were satisfied (4/5). Reading the result on the smart mobile device was rated easy to understand by 99.1% of lay subjects, with 86.1% rated it very easy (5/5) and 13% rated it easy (4/5). If an error message displayed on the report screen, 100% of lay subjects were clear about how to resolve the error, with 56.5% reporting it was very clear (5/5) and 43.5% reported it was clear (4/5).

Government Regulation
 
The principal markets that we have initially targeted for Dario are the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand. The following is an overview of the regulatory regimes in these jurisdictions.
United States Regulation Generally 
 
In the United States, devices are subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation is conducted before a device receives clearance for commercial distribution.  Under Section 201(h) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a medical device is an article, which, among other things, is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, in man or other animals.  The Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System is classified as a medical device and subject to regulation by numerous agencies and legislative bodies, including the FDA and its foreign counterparts.  FDA regulations govern product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, pre-market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, and sales and distribution.  Specifically, the FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Class I devices are relatively simple and can be manufactured and distributed with general controls.  Class II devices are somewhat more complex and require greater scrutiny.  Class III devices are new and frequently help sustain life.
 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States will require a 510(k) clearance, 510(k)+ “de-novo” clearance, or pre-market approval (or PMA) from the FDA.

510(k) Clearance Process.   After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could even require a premarket application approval.  The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision.  If the FDA disagrees with the determination, the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or premarket application approval.  The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket application approval is obtained.
De Novo Classification.   If the FDA denies 510(k) clearance of a device because it is novel and an adequate predicate device does not exist, the “de novo classification” procedure can be invoked based upon reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use.  This procedure approximates the level of scrutiny in the 510(k) process but may add several months to the clearance process. If the FDA grants the request, the device is permitted to enter commercial distribution in the same manner as if 510(k) clearance had been granted.
Premarket Application Approval Process.   After approval of a premarket application, a new premarket application or premarket application supplement is required in the event of a modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process.  The premarket application approval pathway is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain.  It generally takes from one to three years or longer.
 
European and Non-European Regulation Generally
 
Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. These laws and regulations range from simple product registration requirements in some countries to complex clearance and production controls in others.  As a result, the processes and time periods required to obtain foreign marketing clearance may be longer or shorter than those necessary to obtain FDA clearance.
 
Commercialization of medical devices in Europe is regulated by the European Union. The European Union presently requires that all medical products bore the CE mark, an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and demonstrated clinical effectiveness.  Compliance with the Medical Device Directive (MDD) or the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive (AIMD) or the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive (IVDD) as audited by a notified body and certified by a recognized European Competent Authority, permits the manufacturer to affix the CE mark on its products.
 
In September 2013, we obtained ISO 13485 certification for our quality management system and CE Mark certification to market Dario, and in May 2015 Dario was cleared to fulfill the criteria according to EN ISO 15197:2013 The granting of the CE Mark allows Dario to be marketed and sold in 32 countries across Europe as well as in certain other countries worldwide. On November 21, 2014, MDSS, our European Authorized Representative, completed the registration of the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System with the German Authority as required by Article 10 of Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices. We commenced an initial soft launch of the product in Europe in 2014, created initial demand for the product and established brand awareness and marketing techniques to reach our target market with a goal to continue expansion to new markets and territories.
 
We achieved regulatory clearance to market Dario in other countries that do not rely on the CE Mark. To date, the non-CE Mark jurisdictions which we have begun to market Dario include the United States, New Zealand, Canada, and Australia. 
 
In January 2014, we completed the registration with Medsafe, the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority, through their WAND (Web-Assisted Notification of Devices) system allowing us to sell the Dario in New Zealand. We also have completed the process of registering the Dario with the Australian TGA, in the ARTG (Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods), which is required in order to bring and sell the Dario in Australia and effective March 3, 2015, our product is approved for reimbursement in Australia. In February 2015, we also gained National Pharmaceutical Product Interface (known as NAPPI) approval and registered the Dario in South Africa. In May 2015, we also received Health Canada approval to market the Dario blood glucose monitoring system and commenced marketing the product. We have also received reimbursement status from the majority of insurance plans in Canada.

To the extent that we seek to market our product in other non-CE Mark countries in the future, we will be required to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements in each such country.  Such regulatory requirements vary by country and may be tedious.  As a result, no assurance can be given that we will be able to satisfy the regulatory requirements to sell our products in any such country.
 
Clinical Studies
 
Even when a clinical study has an approved Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) from the FDA under significant risk (SR) determination, has been approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) under non-significant risk (NSR) determination and/or has been approved by local or regional Ethics Committee,  the study is subject to factors beyond a manufacturer’s control, including, but not limited to the fact that the institutional review board at a given clinical site might not approve the study, might decline to renew approval which is required annually, or might suspend or terminate the study before the study has been completed. There is no assurance that a clinical study at any given site will progress as anticipated; the interim results of a study may not be satisfactory leading the sponsor or others to terminate the study, there may be an insufficient number of patients who qualify for the study or who agree to participate in the study or the investigator at the site may have priorities other than the study.  Also, there can be no assurance that the clinical study will provide sufficient evidence to assure regulatory authorities that the product is safe, effective and performs as intended as a prerequisite for granting market clearance. See “Clinical Trials” above for clinical trials performed to date.
 
Post-Clearance Matters
 
Even if the FDA or other non-US regulatory authorities approve or clear a device, they may limit its intended uses in such a way that manufacturing and distributing the device may not be commercially feasible. After clearance or approval to market is given, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, upon the occurrence of certain events, are authorized under various circumstances to withdraw the clearance or approval or require changes to a device, its manufacturing process or its labeling or additional proof that regulatory requirements have been met.
 
A manufacturer of a device approved through the premarket approval application process is not permitted to make changes to the device which affects its safety or effectiveness without first submitting a supplement application to its premarket approval application and obtaining FDA clearance for that supplement.  In some instances, the FDA may require a clinical trial to support a supplement application.  A manufacturer of a device cleared through a 510(k) submission or a 510(k)+ “de-novo” submission must submit another premarket notification if it intends to make a change or modification in the device that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, such as a significant change or modification in design, material, chemical composition, energy source or manufacturing process.  Any change in the intended uses of a premarket approval application device or a 510(k) device requires an approval supplement or cleared premarket notification.  Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported, as well as certain FDA export requirements.
 
Mobile Medical Applications Guidance
 
On September 23, 2013, the FDA issued final guidance for developers of mobile medical applications, or apps, which are software programs that run on mobile communication devices and perform the same functions as traditional medical devices.  The guidance outlines the FDA’s tailored approach to mobile apps. The FDA plans to exercise enforcement discretion (meaning it will not enforce requirements under the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act) for the majority of mobile apps as they pose minimal risk to consumers.  The FDA plans to focus its regulatory oversight on a subset of mobile medical apps that present a greater risk to patients if they do not work as intended.  The FDA is focusing its oversight on mobile medical apps that:

● | are intended to be used as an accessory to a regulated medical device – for example, an application that allows a health care professional to make a specific diagnosis by viewing a medical image from a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) on a smart mobile device or a mobile tablet; or 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


21
--


● | transform a mobile platform into a regulated medical device – for example, an application that turns a smart mobile device into an electrocardiography (ECG) machine to detect abnormal heart rhythms or determine if a patient is experiencing a heart attack. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Ongoing Regulation by FDA
 
Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply.  These include:
 

● | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | quality system regulation, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the product life-cycle; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses, and other requirements related to promotional activities; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that may present a risk to health; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of our current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products, rescinding previously granted 510(k) clearances or withdrawing previously granted PMA approvals.
 
We may be subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that our or our subcontractor’s equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product clearance, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing and selling operations.
 
Ongoing Regulation by International Regulators
 
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country.
 
In order to maintain the right to affix the CE Mark to sell medical devices in the European Union, an annual surveillance audit in the company premises and, if needed, at major subcontractors’ premises needs to be carried out by the notified body.  Additionally, European Directives dictate the following requirements:

● | Vigilance system, which requires the manufacturer to immediately notify the relevant Competent Authority when a company product has been involved in an incident that led to a death; led to a serious injury or serious deterioration in the state of health of a patient, user or another person; or might have led to death, serious injury or serious deterioration in health; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


22
--


● | Post-market surveillance including a documented procedure to review experience gained from devices on the market and to implement any necessary corrective action, commensurate with nature and risks involved with the product. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the regulatory agency, which may include any of the following sanctions: fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of our current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusing our request for renewing clearance and/or registration of our products or granting clearance/registration for new products.
 
State Licensure Requirements
 
Several states require that Durable Medical Equipment (“DME”) providers be licensed in order to sell products to patients in that state. Certain of these states require that DME providers maintain an in-state location. If these rules are determined to be applicable to us and if we were found to be noncompliant, we could lose our licensure in that state, which could prohibit us from selling our current or future products to patients in that state.
 
Federal Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Laws
 
The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce the:
 

● | referral of a person;
--+----------------------


● | furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs; or 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | purchase, lease, or order of, or the arrangement or recommendation of the purchasing, leasing, or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
To the extent we are required to comply with these regulations, it is possible that regulatory authorities could allege that we have not complied, which could subject us to sanction.  Noncompliance with the federal anti-kickback legislation can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, as well as civil and criminal penalties, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
Federal law also includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law”, which prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services”, including a company that furnishes durable medical equipment, in which the physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliant arrangement, civil penalties, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs.
 
Federal False Claims Act
 
The Federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved.  In addition, amendments in 1986 to the Federal False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against companies.  Penalties include fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim, plus three times the number of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person.

Civil Monetary Penalties Law
 
The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance can result in civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the Federal healthcare programs.
State Fraud and Abuse Provisions
 
Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and false claims acts. A determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
Administrative Simplification of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, mandated the adoption of standards for the exchange of electronic health information in an effort to encourage overall administrative simplification and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the healthcare industry. Ensuring the privacy and security of patient information is one of the key factors driving the legislation.
Intellectual Property 
 
Patent applications
 
On May 8, 2011, certain of our founders filed a Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) Application No. PCT/IL2011/000369, titled “Fluids Testing Apparatus and Methods of Use.”  This PCT took priority from two preceding U.S. provisional applications filed by our founders, with the earliest priority date being May 9, 2010. The PCT application was transferred to us by our founders on October 27, 2011.
 
This application covers the novel blood glucose measurement device, comprising the glucose meter; and an adaptor that connects the glucose meter to a smart-phone to receive power supply and data display, storage, and analysis.  A PCT search report and written opinion on patentability that we received from World Intellectual Property Organization (known as WIPO) were very positive, including only two “Y” citations, meaning no significant prior art was found with regards to novelty and inventiveness of the application.  Corresponding national applications of our PCT were filed in November 2012 in the U.S., Europe, and other major territories.
 
On May 1, 2014, we announced the receipt of a U.S. Notice of Allowance for a key patent relating to how the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System draws power from and transmits data to a smartphone via the audio jack port. This patent was issued as U.S. Patent No. 8,797,180 in August 2014, and in September 2015, we have issued a U.S. patent (No. 9,125,549) that broadens our registered patent No. 8,797,180 to include testing of other bodily fluids through an audio jack connection. We believe this represents critical intellectual property recognition and a significant initial validation of our intellectual property efforts. Further, a corresponding European patent was granted to us in May 2016, as European patent No. 2569622 for testing of fluids through an audio jack connection. Additional corresponding patents were granted in Israel. Corresponding applications for this invention are still pending in the U.S., China, and Australia. On November 11, 2017, U.S. patent No. 9,832,301 titled “Systems and methods for adjusting power levels on a monitoring device” was granted. This latest patent enhances the way the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System communicates with users’ smartphone devices.
 
Additionally, a U.S. non-provisional and corresponding PCT application were filed, and are still pending, which cover new connection related technologies.
 
Additional patent applications are in the process of being prepared for filing, and we believe that we have a rich pipeline of future technologies that we are actively developing.

We are further seeking to develop and protect new intellectual property around future generations of our hardware and software with the goal of achieving enhanced functionality, user interface and data usability.
 
Design patents and patent applications on the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System
 
To further protect our market distinction and branding for the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System, three U.S. Design Applications have been filed and granted covering the glucose meter, the cartridge, and connection dongle. These applications were granted and registered in the United States. We have also filed national applications for the cartridge in many other jurisdictions, the great majority of which have been granted.
 
Design patents and patent applications on the Dario Smart Diabetes Management App
 
In addition, three U.S. Design Applications have been filed and granted covering our smart mobile device display screens with the graphical user interface. These design applications were also filed in several major jurisdictions, all of which have been granted.
 
Trademark applications
 
We have also filed three trademark applications covering the “Dario” name and logo, and our company’s name “DarioHealth.”  “Dario” is registered as a trademark in the United States, Israel, China, Canada, Hong Kong, South Africa, Japan, Costa Rica, and Panama. “DarioHealth” is registered as a trademark in the United States and Israel.
 
Utility Models
 
We have been granted Utility Models for our core invention in Japan and Germany.
 
Other intangible assets
 
As the number of Dario users grows, a large amount of data will be collected from diabetic patients, comprising their blood sugar levels, meal composition, and timing, physical exercise (intensity and duration) as well as many other factors, which are useful for creating meaningful correlations between these factors and insulin use.  We expect that this database will be highly valuable and may be capitalized in many ways. The accumulation of this type of know-how and related algorithms are protected as trade secrets using specialized confidentiality protocols.
Competition 
 
We face competition in each segment of our offering (device, applications, coaching and analytics) and more importantly from competitors integrating these four components.
 
Blood Glucose Monitors (BGM). Our device competes directly and primarily with other BGM suppliers including, but not limited to, Abbott Laboratories, Ascensia (formerly Bayer Diabetes Care), Johnson & Johnson LifeScan, Roche Diabetes and a large number of low-price private label manufacturers.  Some of these devices connect to smartphones and tablets, such as, but not limited to, the Sanofi iBGStar, Medisana GlucoDock, Philosys Gmate Smart, One Drop, and iHealth Align.
 
Continuous blood Glucose Monitors (CGM). Continuous blood glucose monitors have made significant market progression in the last few years. More insulin-using patients are using them on a continuing basis rather than an intermittent basis.
 
While the market is highly competitive, we believe that we have important comparative advantages.
 
- | We offer an all-in-one glucose monitoring system, including a small form factor glucose reader, lancing device and a strip cartridge connected to existing smart mobile devices
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | We cover largely non-insulin using patients and therefore do not compete with CGM. A large percentage of insulin-using patients prefer to test with a BGM rather than a CGM
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Most importantly, in our opinion, is our integrated solution separates us from BGM and CGM competitors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diabetes management applications. There are hundreds of diabetes management applications available for download (such as Glucose Buddy, mySugr (now part of Roche Diabetes), Carb Manager, Sugar Sense and Welldoc). We believe that the existing diabetes management application do not offer a good value and users quickly stop using them.
 
We believe that our application is differentiated as compared to our competitors by the high level of engagement by our users, coming from a unique know-how in terms of user experience, as well as the nature of our integrated solution.
 
Coaching services. Pure coaching services such as Cecilia Health (formerly Fit4D), or services delivered by medical distributors or healthcare providers are often relatively expensive and mostly offered on a limited time basis (e.g. one month after the discharge of a patient, or three months for onboarding of a new drug). We believe that our coaching services is differentiated as compared to our competitors in that our coaching services are an essential part of our solution and is maintained throughout a patient’s use of our application.
 
Digital health integrated competitors. Several digital health competitors integrate several, or all of, the four components of our offering, including but not limited to: Livongo, Glooko, Omada, OneDrop. In practice, we believe that the closest competitor in terms of an integrated offering is Livongo.
 
Our differentiation versus such integrated competitors includes
 
- | Proven and significant results, placing us in the category of “Digital Therapeutics” (DTx);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Open platform (capable of integrating non-proprietary devices and coaching services);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Operating in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia/New Zealand;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


- | Small form factor glucose reader whereas most devices from competitors have the size of another cell phone that the user needs to carry around;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Instant connection of the reader with the phone, thus maximizing opportunities to engage with the user; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Flexibility of our product to integrate with the workflows of its business partners (e.g. with the health communication generated by a retailer, with the coaches operating from a diabetes clinic).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
