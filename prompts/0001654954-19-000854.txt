The business operations provide services to the pharmaceutical, chemical, biotechnology, medical devices, cosmetic and food industries, and allied products companies principally in Puerto Rico, the United States, Europe and Brazil.

  OVERVIEW
 
 We are a compliance and technology transfer services consulting firm with headquarters in Puerto Rico, servicing the Puerto Rico, United States, Europe and Brazil markets. The compliance consulting service sector in those markets consists of local compliance and validation consulting firms, United States dedicated validation and compliance consulting firms, and large publicly traded and private domestic and foreign engineering and consulting firms. We provide a broad range of compliance related consulting services. We market our services to pharmaceutical, chemical, biotechnology, medical devices, cosmetic and food industries, and allied products companies in Puerto Rico, the United States, Europe and Brazil. Our consulting team includes experienced engineering and life science professionals, former quality assurance managers and directors, and professionals with bachelors, masters and doctorate degrees in health sciences and engineering.
  
 We have a well-established and consistent relationships with the major pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and chemical manufacturing companies in Puerto Rico and the United States, which provides us access to affiliated companies in other markets. We seek opportunities in markets that can yield profitable margins using our professional consulting force.
  
 We believe the most significant factors to achieving future business growth include our ability to: (i) continue to provide quality value-added compliance services to our clients; (ii) recruit and retain highly educated and experienced consultants; (iii) further expand our products and services to address the expanding needs of our clients; and (iv) expand our market presence in the United States, Europe, Brazil and other emerging pharmaceutical markets in order to respond to the international compliance needs of our clients and potential clients. Our business is affected to the extent economic conditions impact the decisions of our clients and potential clients to establish operations or to continue or expand their existing operations.
 
 Our revenue is derived from (i) time and materials contracts (representing approximately 99% of total revenue), where the clients are charged for the time, materials and expenses incurred on a particular project or service and (ii) fixed-fee contracts or from “not to exceed” contracts (approximately 1% of total revenue), which are generally short-term contracts, in which the value of the contract cannot exceed a stated amount. For time and materials contracts, our revenue is principally a function of the number of consultants and the number of hours billed per consultant. To the extent that our revenue is based on fixed-fee or “not to exceed” contracts, our ability to operate profitably is dependent upon our ability to estimate accurately the costs that we will incur on a project and to manage and monitor the project. If we underestimate our costs on any contract, we could sustain a loss on the contract or its profitability might be reduced.

 The principal components for our consulting costs of services are resource compensation to our consulting team and expenses relating to the performance of the services. In order to ensure that our pricing is competitive yet minimize the impact on our margins, we manage increasing labor costs by (i) selecting consultants according to our cost for specific projects, (ii) negotiating, where applicable, rates with the consultant, (iii) subcontracting labor and (iv) negotiating and passing rate increases to our customers, as applicable. Although this strategy has been successful in the past, we cannot give any assurance that such strategy will continue to be successful.
  
 We have established quality systems for our employees which include:
 
  ● 
 Training Programs - including a current Good Manufacturing Practices exam prior to recruitment and periodic refreshers;


  ● 
 Recruitment Full Training Program - including employee manual, dress code, time sheets and good project management and control procedures, job descriptions, and firm operating and administration procedures;


  ● 
 Safety Program - including Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and Environmental Health and Safety; and


  ● 
 Code of Ethics and Business Conduct - a code of ethics and business conduct is used and enforced as one of the most significant company controls on personal behavior.


 In addition, we have implemented procedures to respond to client complaints and have in place customer satisfaction survey procedures. As part of our employee performance appraisal annual process, our clients receive an evaluation form for employee project performance feedback, including compliance with our code of ethics and business conduct.
 
 During the year ended October 31, 2017 and most of the year ended October 31, 2018, we operated in four reportable segments: (i) Puerto Rico technical compliance consulting, (ii) United States technical compliance consulting, (iii) Europe technical compliance consulting, and (iv) a Puerto Rico microbiological and chemical laboratory testing division (“Lab”). On September 17, 2018, based on a corporate strategy to refocus the Company on consulting services, the Company sold substantially all of its laboratory business assets. As a result of the sale, the Company currently operates three reportable business segments: (i) Puerto Rico technical compliance consulting, (ii) United States technical compliance consulting, and (iii) Europe technical compliance consulting.
 
  BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OBJECTIVES
 
 We are actively pursuing to expand our services in the United States, European and Brazilian markets as part of our growth strategy, while maintaining our position in the Puerto Rico market. We have a well-established and consistent relationship with the major pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and chemical manufacturing companies in Puerto Rico and the United States which provides us access to affiliated companies in other markets. We seek opportunities in markets that can yield profitable margins using our professional consulting force.
  
 Our business strategy is based on a commitment to provide premium quality and professional consulting services and reliable customer service to our customer base. Our business strategy and objectives are as follow:
  
  ●

  TECHNICAL CONSULTING SERVICES
 
 We have established a reputation as a premier technical consulting services firm to the pharmaceutical, chemical, biotechnology, medical devices, cosmetic and food industries, and allied products companies in various markets. These services include regulatory compliance, validation, technology transfer, engineering, project management and process support. We have approximately 60 clients that are among the largest pharmaceutical, chemical manufacturing, medical device and biotechnology companies. We are actively participating in exhibitions, conferences, conventions and seminars as either exhibitors, sponsors or conference speakers.
 MARKETING
 
 We conduct our marketing activities in Puerto Rico, United States, Europe and other marketplaces. We actively utilize our project managers and leaders who are currently managing consulting service contracts at various client locations to also market consulting and laboratory testing services to their existing and past client relationships. Our senior management is also actively involved in the marketing process, especially in marketing to major accounts. Our senior management and staff also concentrate on developing new business opportunities and focus on the larger customer accounts (by number of consultants or dollar volume) and responding to prospective customers’ requests for proposals.
 PRINCIPAL CUSTOMERS
 
 We provide a substantial portion of our services to three customers, each of whom accounted for 10% or more of our revenues in either of the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017. During the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, these customers accounted for, in the aggregate, 34.7% and 25.9% of total revenue, respectively. Although a few customers represent a significant source of revenue, our functions are not a continuous process, accordingly, the client base for which our services are typically rendered, on a project-by-project basis, changes regularly. Therefore, in any given year a small number of customers could represent a significant source of our revenue for that year. The loss of, or significant reduction in the scope of work performed for any major customer or our inability to replace customers upon completion of contracts could adversely affect our revenue and impair our ability to operate profitably.
 COMPETITION
 
 We are engaged in a highly competitive and fragmented industry. Some of our competitors are, on an overall basis, larger than we are or are subsidiaries of larger companies, and therefore may possess greater resources than we do. Furthermore, because the technical professional aspects of our consulting business do not usually require large amounts of capital, there is relative ease of market entry for a new entrant possessing acceptable professional qualifications. Accordingly, we compete with regional, national, and international firms. Within the Puerto Rico, United States, Europe and Brazil markets, certain competitors, including local competitors, may possess greater resources than we do as well as better access to clients and potential clients.
  
 Competition for validation and consulting services used to be primarily based on reputation, track record, experience, and quality of service. However, given our clients' strategies to reduce costs, price of service has become a major factor in sourcing our services. We believe we benefit from competitive advantages over other consulting service firms because of our historical market share within Puerto Rico (over 25 years), brand name, reputation and track record with many of the major pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and chemical manufacturing companies, which have a presence in the markets we serve and are pursuing.
  
 The market of qualified and experienced consultants that are capable of providing technical consulting services is very competitive and consists primarily of our competitors as well as companies in the pharmaceutical, chemical, biotechnology and medical device industries who are our clients and potential clients. In seeking qualified personnel, we market our name recognition in the Puerto Rico market, our reputation with our clients, and salary and benefit packages.
