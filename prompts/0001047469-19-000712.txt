  Item 1. Business: 
         International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 90 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues todaythe company creates value for clients by providing integrated solutions and products that leverage: data, information technology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, with trust and security and a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. IBM solutions typically create value by enabling new capabilities for clients that transform their businesses and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry-leading portfolio of consulting and IT implementation services, cloud, digital and cognitive offerings, and enterprise systems and software which are all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations. 
   IBM Strategy 
         IBM's strategy is wholly focused on the needs of its clients. IBM is a technology company, but first and foremost it is an enterprise company. IBM serves enterprises of all sizes, and IBM's longest-standing clients are leaders in their industriesthe world's leading financial services institutions, airlines, manufacturers, consumer goods and retail companies. IBM's mission is to help its clients transform their companies and lead in their industries. 
         One of the biggest priorities for IBM clients is to derive competitive advantage through insights and the latest digital technologies. Better insight about the wants and needs of their customers will help them distinguish themselves in the marketplace. Data-driven insight will also influence how they design and produce their own products, as well as help them identify opportunities in new markets. 
         However, most companies are harnessing only a small percent of the valuable data they collect. As IBM clients embark on the next chapter of their digital journey, the proper collection, use, safeguarding and management of data is of paramount importance. Choosing the right digital technologies to analyze the data is also necessary. 
         IBM helps clients harness the power of their data through technologies like AI, analytics and blockchain; on a hybrid cloud that connects data across traditional and new environments; with services that put a client's data and insight to use in and for their business. Underpinning all of this, IBM safeguards client data with world-class technologies and approaches to security. 
         By reinventing themselves digitally around insight, clients become what IBM calls Cognitive Enterprises. 
   What IBM Brings to Clients 
         Businesses are choosing IBM because they want to partner with a company that can uniquely integrate three core capabilities: 
 

1.They
want the most innovative technology, like AI, blockchain, cybersecurity and quantum delivered in a hybrid cloud
environment.
2.They
want industry expertisefrom a partner that deeply understands their industry and can apply
innovation to their business processes to drive transformation and competitive advantage. 

 1

  

3.And,
finally, they want a total commitment to trust and security. Clients want to partner with a company that will
protect their valuable data and insights, and one that develops and deploys new innovations with a commitment to do so responsibly. 

         IBM is unique in that it can integrate all three core capabilities for clients. 
   Innovative Technology 
         IBM has a long history of bringing innovative technology to the world. For 26 years, IBM has led the world in U.S. patents; six IBMers are Nobel Laureates; and IBM engineers have developed innumerable first-of-its-kind products and services. Current examples of IBM's innovative technology include:


 Analytics and AI: IBM's long-standing leadership in managing and extracting insights from data starts with a portfolio of analytics and
database offerings. A few years ago, IBM brought AI into the mainstream with the Watson platform, which to date has been the foundation of many Enterprise AI implementations in production. Recently,
IBM augmented its Watson platform with a set of AI tools that enable clients to trace the origins of the data their AI models use, explain what is behind their recommendations and ensure that bias has
not crept into results. These innovations are making AI more consumable by everyday usersnot just data scientists. 
 Security: Businesses built around data require an unparalleled level of data security. IBM is the leader in information security for
enterpriseswith leadership in both security software and services. Security is embedded inside all of IBM's products and services. For example, IBM Z offers pervasive security by building
data encryption directly in its computing processor. In addition, IBM's Services businesses are world class in embedding security into the solutions they build and run for IBM clients. 
 Blockchain is an exciting technology that is just beginning to transform business processes. IBM's platform has been rated number one by
leading analyst firms such as Juniper Research and Everest Group. Blockchain technology enables multiple parties to conduct business with each other on a single, unified distributed system,
eliminating the costly and time-consuming hand-offs of fragmented systems. IBM is deploying blockchain technology with clients to transform how global trade is transacted, how food safety is tracked
and how supply chains are managed. 
 Cloud: Enterprise clients are in the very early stages of the move to cloud. IBM estimates that only 20 percent of workloads have moved
to the cloudwith work ahead for the remaining 80 percent. The first part was to move business workloads that exist as a layer over core processes. The hard part is ahead: moving
the mission-critical systems that run banking, retail, telecom and other industries. Some of these workloads will remain in traditional IT systems, some will move to a private cloud inside the safety
of a client's firewall, others will move to public clouds, and some will surge between all of these. Wherever a workload may reside, it will need to share its data across environments. All of this
requires an approach that is open, highly interoperable between environments, and even interoperable between different public clouds. This is what IBM has long called hybrid cloudand this
describes the solution for the 80 percent of the workloads that is to come. With in-depth experience across all three environments, IBM brings the strongest hybrid cloud solution to the market
for enterpriseswhich will be strengthened through the acquisition of Red Hat, Inc. (Red Hat). 

 Industry Expertise 
         Changing a business requires in-depth understanding of how a business works and how technology can make it work differently. 
 2

          IBM brings both industry expertise and innovative technology to clients through the IBM services and products businesses. This combination makes IBM unique and essential. 
         A few examples of this capability are highlighted below:
 

 Global Business Services: the IBM GBS business is one of the world's largest professional services businesses. Its mission is to help clients
along the journey to becoming a Cognitive Enterprise. 
 Global Technology Services: the IBM GTS business runs some of the world's largest data centersand thereby some of the world's most
mission-critical workflows and franchises. GTS helps clients along their journey to the hybrid cloudleveraging the best of their existing systems in the context of the regulatory,
security and workflow of their industry. 
 Industry and Domain-Specific Solutions: augmenting IBM's services businesses are software and solutions designed for specific industries and
domains. For example: 



Health:
IBM has become a leader in applying advanced digital technologies to healthcare, including the application of AI and data analytics to the diagnosis and treatment of patients, bringing smart
decisions to Health Care payers, and helping Life Sciences companies develop innovative products and services. 
Financial
Services: IBM is a leading provider in the Financial Services industry; with IBM's Promontory Financial Group, a leading advisor in Financial Regulation and Compliance, IBM offers an
advanced set of solutions for managing Risk and Compliance, a critical workflow in the Financial Services industry. 


 Trust and Security 
         Data and AItogether, they are both the opportunity and the issue of current times. They can make the world a better, healthier and more productive place; but only if businesses and consumers trust the companies putting data and AI to work. 
         IBM is a 107-year old businessand the reason it has been successful for so long is because it has earned the trust of its clients. IBM has not only followed guidelines around the responsible handling of data and the stewardship of new technology, but created them, published them, and invited others to adopt similar commitments. IBM's principles make clear that:
 

 The purpose of new technologies is to augmentnot replacehuman expertise; 
 Data and insights derived from AI belong to their owners and creators (not their IT partners); and, 
 New technologies must be transparent and explainable. 

         There are many companies in the IT industry who bring technology products to the marketplace. Many bring technology services to the marketplace. A few companies do both, but no one can do it as well as IBM when it comes to meeting the needs of clients. By bringing together technology and workflow, combining it with industry expertise, innovation and deployment, IBM helps clients and industries truly transform themselves. 
         This is what truly sets IBM apart. 
   Business Model 
         The company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping enterprise clients to move from one era to the next by bringing together innovative technology and industry expertise, and providing long-term value to shareholders. The business model has been developed over time through 
 3

  strategic investments in capabilities and technologies that have long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients. 
         The company's global capabilities include services, software, systems, fundamental research and related financing. The broad mix of businesses and capabilities are combined to provide integrated solutions and platforms to the company's clients. 
         The business model is dynamic, adapting to the continuously changing industry and economic environment, including the company's transformation into cloud and as-a-Service delivery models. The company continues to strengthen its position through strategic organic investments and acquisitions in higher-value areas, broadening its industry expertise and integrating AI into more of what the company offers. In addition, the company is transforming into a more agile enterprise to drive innovation and speed, as well as helping to drive productivity, which supports investments for participation in markets with significant long-term opportunity. The company also regularly evaluates its portfolio and proactively maximizes shareholder value of non-strategic assets by bringing products to end of life, engaging in IP partnerships or executing divestitures. 
         This business model, supported by the company's financial model, has enabled the company to deliver strong earnings, cash flows and returns to shareholders over the long term. 
   Business Segments and Capabilities 
         The company's major operations consist of five business segments: Cognitive Solutions, Global Business Services, Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, Systems and Global Financing.

Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. As part of its business model, the company licenses certain of its intellectual property assets, which constitute high-value technology, but may be applicable in more mature markets. The licensee drives the future development of the IP and ultimately expands the customer base. This generates IP income for the company both upon licensing, and with any ongoing royalty arrangements between it and the licensee. While the company's various proprietary IP rights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. 
   Competition 
         The company is a globally-integrated enterprise, operating in more than 175 countries. The company participates in a highly competitive environment, where its competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall, across its business segments, the company recognizes hundreds of competitors worldwide. 
         Across its business, the company's principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; its broad range of capabilities, products and services; client relationships; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, a corporation must continue to invest, innovate and integrate. Over the last several years, the company has been making investments and shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into its offerings while building new solutions and modernizing its existing platforms. These investments not only drive current performance, but will extend the company's innovation leadership into the future. The company's key differentiators are built around three pillarsinnovative technology, industry expertise and trust and security, uniquely delivered through an integrated model. As the company executes its strategy, it has entered into new markets, such as hybrid cloud, digital, analytics, AI, blockchain and quantum, and deployed new delivery models, including as-a-service solutions, each of which expose the company to new competitors. Overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of its business segments.
