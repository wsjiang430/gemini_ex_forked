--------+---------

 Career Education Corporation (“CEC”) was incorporated in Delaware in 1994. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company” and “CEC” refer to Career Education Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. The terms “institution” and “university” refer to an individual, branded, for-profit educational institution owned by us and includes its campus locations. The term “campus” refers to an individual main or branch campus operated by one of our institutions.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 Career Education’s academic institutions offer a quality education to a diverse student population in a variety of disciplines through online, campus-based and blended learning programs. Our two regionally-accredited universities – Colorado Technical University (“CTU”) and American InterContinental University (“AIU”) – provide degree programs through the master’s or doctoral level as well as associate and bachelor’s levels. Both universities predominantly serve students online with career-focused degree programs that are designed to meet the educational needs of today’s busy adults. CTU and AIU continue to show innovation in higher education, advancing new personalized learning technologies like their intellipath® learning platform. Career Education is committed to providing quality education that closes the gap between learners who seek to advance their careers and employers needing a qualified workforce.
 CTU places a strong focus on providing industry-relevant degree programs to meet the needs of our non-traditional students for career advancement and of employers for a well-educated workforce and offers academic programs in the career-oriented disciplines of business studies, nursing, computer science, engineering, information systems and technology, cybersecurity, criminal justice and healthcare management. Students pursue their degrees through fully-online programs, local campuses and blended formats, which combine campus-based and online education. 
 AIU focuses on helping busy non-traditional students get the degree they need to move forward in their career as efficiently as possible and offers academic programs in the career-oriented disciplines of business studies, information technologies, education and criminal justice. Students pursue their degrees through fully-online programs, local campuses and blended formats, which combine campus-based and online education. 
 We refer to CTU and AIU collectively as our University Group.
 Additionally, in 2018 CEC completed the multi-year process of teaching out all campuses within the All Other Campuses segment, as part of the strategic decision to pursue a transformation strategy aimed at reducing the complexity of operations and focusing our attention on our University Group institutions. Students enrolled at these campuses were provided a reasonable opportunity to complete their program of study prior to the final teach-out date. Our All Other Campuses segment previously offered educational programs in career-oriented disciplines complemented by business studies and information technology as well as culinary arts. The Company announced the complete teach-out of all campuses in this segment in 2015, at which time they had 44 campus locations. The teach-out process of these campuses ended at varying dates since 2015 with the final campus closure in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
 A listing of individual campus locations and web links to Career Education’s University Group institutions can be found at www.careered.com.
 Substantially all of the students attending our institutions reside within the United States of America.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND AND COMPETITION
 The domestic postsecondary education industry is highly fragmented and competitive, with no one provider having a significant market share. The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended and reauthorized (“Higher Education Act”), and the related regulations govern all higher education institutions participating in federal student aid and loan programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act (“Title IV Programs”). According to the National Center for Education Statistics (“NCES”), there were approximately 6,700 Title IV eligible postsecondary education institutions in the United States for the academic year 2017-18, including approximately 2,800 for-profit schools; approximately 2,000 public, non-profit schools; and approximately 1,900 private, non-profit schools. According to the U.S. Department of Education (“ED” or the “Department”), over the 12-month period July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017 approximately 26.7 million students were attending institutions that participate in the various Title IV Programs.
 The domestic postsecondary degree-granting education industry was an approximately $564 billion industry for academic year 2015-16, according to a report published in 2018 by the Department. We compete in this industry primarily with other degree-granting regionally accredited colleges and universities, both for-profit and non-profit. In particular, there is growing competition from online programs at these institutions as they increase their online offerings in response to growing demand.
 Most postsecondary institutions, regardless of how they are organized, face significant challenges, including:
  
• | a continued focus on the cost and availability of a college education;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | concerns over the high level of college student indebtedness;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | questions about the quality of academic programs and the ability to translate the value of a postsecondary education into economic mobility;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | competition from lower cost alternatives and from non-traditional competitors or new alternative educational paths; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the importance of preparing students with relevant skills to manage new and rapidly changing technologies and supporting employers in their efforts to optimize and advance their workforce.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Postsecondary institutions are also subject to significant regulations which provide for a regulatory triad by mandating specific regulatory responsibilities for each of the following:
  
• | The accrediting agencies recognized by ED;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | the federal government through ED; and
--+---------------------------------------


• | state higher education regulatory bodies.
--+------------------------------------------

 Extensive and increasingly complex ED regulations governing postsecondary institutions have been enacted, including regulations applicable only to for-profit institutions. These regulations, coupled with the increased focus by the U.S. Congress on the role that for-profit educational institutions play in higher education, as well as the evolving needs and objectives of students and employers, economic constraints affecting educational institutions and increased focus on affordability and value may cause increased competition across the industry as well as contribute to continued changes in business operating strategies.

We believe that the competitive factors in the online postsecondary degree-granting education industry include:
  
• | quality of the academic programs offered;
--+------------------------------------------


• | affordability;
--+---------------


• | breadth of degree offerings;
--+-----------------------------


• | convenient and flexible delivery of instruction;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | technological advancements and capability;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | experienced faculty members engaged in the practice of their fields;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | effectiveness of student support and outreach strategies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | reputation among prospective students and employers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 The majority of our degree-seeking students today have one or more non-traditional characteristics (e.g., did not enroll immediately after high school graduation, work full-time, are financially independent for purposes of financial aid eligibility, have dependents other than a spouse or are single parents). These non-traditional students typically are looking to improve their skills and enhance their earning potential within the context of their careers or in pursuit of new careers. As the industry has shifted to more students with non-traditional characteristics, an increasing proportion of colleges and universities are addressing the needs of working students. This includes colleges with well-established brand names that were historically focused on traditional students.
 Although competition exists, for-profit educators serve a segment of the market for postsecondary education that we believe has not been fully addressed by traditional public and private universities. Non-profit public and private institutions can face limited financial resources to expand their offerings in response to growth or changes in the demand for education, due to a combination of state funding challenges, significant expenditures required for research and the professor tenure system. Certain private institutions also may control enrollments to preserve the perceived prestige and exclusivity of their degree offerings. For-profit providers of postsecondary education offer potential students the greater flexibility and convenience of their institutions' programmatic offerings and learning structure and an emphasis on applied content and the use of technology in the delivery of the education. At the same time, the share of the postsecondary education market that has been captured by for-profit providers remains relatively small. As a result, we believe that in spite of regulatory and other challenges facing the industry, for-profit postsecondary education providers continue to have significant opportunities to address the demand for postsecondary education.
 We believe that the online postsecondary education market continues to grow and gain acceptance across employers seeking qualified candidates for employment. Growth in the postsecondary education industry is being driven by online enrollment for a variety of reasons, including:
  
• | a growing demographic of adult learners;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | a current gap in attainment of higher education for adult learners; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continued increased economic benefit for employees who hold a bachelor’s degree as compared to those with lower-level degrees.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe that the following strengths differentiate our business:
 Strong level of support for student retention and academic outcomes. The successful execution of our transformation strategy has enabled us to continue investing in student-serving processes and initiatives which we believe will contribute to improved student experiences, retention and academic outcomes. Our universities have also continued to focus on refining and executing operational changes with the same goal. We believe our admissions and advising operating models have improved accountability and coordination between the functions, ultimately helping our students. There is accountability at the advisor and manager levels to promote and enhance student engagement. As an education company, academic outcomes are the most relevant and critical measure of our success. Our institutions are dedicated to recruiting and retaining quality faculty and instructors with relevant industry experience and appropriate academic credentials. We continue to invest and leverage technology to further enhance student learning and promote faculty engagement. This is evidenced by our advancements in mobile technology for our students and faculty that has made overall classroom activities easier to complete. We have also redesigned the academic calendar within AIU, which better aligns with student lives. We seek to identify emerging industry trends in order to understand the evolving educational needs of our students and graduates and we continue to work with our university regulators to expand our program offerings to provide students with increased choices.
 Flexibility in delivery models. Development of a virtual campus that engages online students with their instructor, their peers and the content is critical to the achievement of improved student learning outcomes. CEC’s online instructional delivery is accomplished utilizing an innovative, student-focused proprietary learning management system. While online content delivery is very common today, CEC’s course content delivery system, M.U.S.E. (My Unique Student Experience), has several features that make it 
 3

distinctive in the education marketplace. Designed around the students, M.U.S.E. is a rich, engaging student experience that represents an innovative online method of delivering content that includes the following capabilities:
  
• | supports multiple learning styles, allowing students to choose their preferred method of engaging with the content;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enables students to choose the order of topics to study within a predetermined framework of learning objectives; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provides search capability that allows students to interact with the content more efficiently and effectively.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, CTU and AIU each have a student mobile application which was created to complement students’ mobile-centric lives. The mobile applications offer users the ability to connect with their university, track grades and degree progress in real-time and participate in courses from the palm of their hand. The student benefits of the mobile applications include motivating students and helping them connect with the university and remain on track with their course of study. CTU and AIU also have a faculty mobile application which provides informative dashboards, ability to complete tasks on the go and enhanced outreach and communication capabilities that we believe will make teacher-student interactions easier and more effective. 
 
Both CTU and AIU have also fully implemented a two-way messaging platform within the mobile application to support effective and efficient student outreach and communication with advising, admissions and financial aid personnel. Our students and staff are increasingly using the messenger due to its ease and simplicity. 
 Innovative personalized learning technology. Through our equity investment in CCKF, a Dublin-based educational technology company that provides intelligent, adaptive systems to power the delivery of personalized learning, we have strengthened our leadership position as a technology innovator in higher education and as a company dedicated to student success. Our personalized learning content was developed by teams of our own instructors and has been integrated across many of our curricula. We have a perpetual license to this technology, which, when integrated with our proprietary learning management system, we refer to as intellipath.® This academic and technological breakthrough continues to advance our understanding of the learning process and support improved student academic outcomes. Personalized learning, supported by intellipath technology, allows us to visualize how each student learns through their interaction with the material.
 Intellipath serves as a powerful platform to help our students learn. It identifies and gives more time in areas where students need more help, while moving past areas they already know. In many respects, personalized learning serves as an excellent way to facilitate and demonstrate mastery in a competency-based learning environment. Personalized learning is changing the nature of higher education by measuring real-time knowledge growth minute-by-minute and understanding of the material on a student-by-student basis.
 The success of this personalized learning platform lies in the abundance of data it collects, which in turn helps our instructors determine how to structure courses, deliver material to students, predict and mitigate individual student challenges and identify teaching practices that yield the strongest results. A major difference between our platform and others is that it focuses on student learning achievements rather than solely on student satisfaction or how fast it facilitates a student to complete assignments.
 Strong student outreach strategies. We have invested significant resources in developing processes and implementing technologies that allow us to effectively recruit and retain qualified students. We develop and participate in various marketing activities which build awareness of the CTU and AIU brands among prospective students. Our marketing programs are designed to differentiate our brands in the marketplace and maximize each institution’s opportunity to serve a targeted section of the potential student population. 
 Over the past two years we have invested in two new admissions and advising centers in Chandler and Tempe, Arizona and increased our investments within the student advising, admissions and academic functions. These investments have enabled us to support the increased demand we experienced during 2018. 
 Additionally, we have invested in technologies that allow us to customize outreach strategies based on student interest before contacting students. This technology consolidates data into a single prospective student contact center platform and provides us with flexible outreach strategies and improves time utilization. Some other key benefits include work force scheduling and improved call and call recording analytics. We have seen improvement in the number of students we are able to connect with and we believe students have an improved overall experience in communications with our staff. 
 Seasonality
 Our quarterly net revenues and income may fluctuate primarily as a result of the pattern of student enrollments. For CTU, the seasonality of our business has decreased over the last several years due to an increased percentage of students enrolling in online programs, which generally experience less seasonal fluctuations than campus-based programs. Within AIU, a calendar redesign was implemented during 2017 which impacts quarterly comparability in the foreseeable future as each quarter may have non-comparable revenue-earnings days. While operating costs for our institutions generally do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, we do traditionally increase our marketing investments during the first and third fiscal quarters in relation to the back to school seasons.

Revenues, operating income (loss) and net income (loss) by quarter for each of the past two fiscal years are included in Note 19 “Quarterly Financial Summary” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
 BUSINESS AND OPERATING STRATEGY
 To compete successfully in today’s demanding economy, people benefit from higher education that provides a foundation of knowledge and skills they can use in the workplace and to build meaningful careers. We aim to provide effective, industry-relevant postsecondary education to a diverse population, providing our students the opportunity to use their education to advance personally and professionally. 
 Our strategy is aimed at leveraging near-term demands for higher education with a career focus, while continuing to build the capabilities necessary to deliver sustainable and responsible long-term growth for our organization and its institutions. Within our University Group, we are focused on increasing the efficacy of our programs while seeking operational efficiencies in an effort to improve the student experience across the student lifecycle - for our campus-based students as well as our online students.
 The importance of quality education at our institutions cannot be overstated. The quality of the education we provide and the manner in which we provide it can directly lead to better student outcomes. We will strive to offer new programs at institutions and particular campuses as there is both student demand for the education, as well as workplace demand for graduates in that field of study. As we continue to innovate in our delivery of online education, we will continue to build upon that history and continue developing new education technologies that enhance the learning experience for students. We believe our intellipath® personalized learning platform provides our organization and its institutions a strategic advantage by providing a more customized student experience and we will continue to expand its use as a key differentiator.
 Growing the academic and economic value of our university platforms by enhancing student retention and academic outcomes also aligns with the interest of creating stockholder value. Our successful execution and completion of our transformation efforts has given us the ability to focus our resources and attention on our university institutions. We are committed to investing in our university brands, technology and faculty, all of which contribute to positive student experiences, retention and academic outcomes. 
 Our business and operating strategy is built upon core guiding principles, including:
  
• | sustainable and responsible growth;
--+------------------------------------


• | student retention and academic outcomes;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | academic quality and integrity;
--+--------------------------------


• | compliance with regulations; and
--+---------------------------------


• | innovation and collaboration.
--+------------------------------

 In addition to the Company’s core business and operating strategy, the Company has been focused on building a strong balance sheet while prudently investing in organic growth projects. As we further build our cash balances, we will continue to evaluate diverse strategies to enhance shareholder value, including acquisitions of quality educational institutions and programs, while emphasizing organic student-serving investments at our universities and maintaining liquidity.
 Sustainable and Responsible Growth
 Student Recruitment and Marketing
 Our institutions seek highly motivated students with both the desire and ability to complete their academic programs of choice. To promote interest among potential students, each of our universities engages in a wide variety of marketing activities. Our marketing programs are designed to differentiate our brands in the marketplace and maximize each institution’s opportunity to serve a targeted section of the potential student population.
 Within our University Group, we continue our focus on expanding strategic relationships with corporate partners. We expect these relationships to result in new student interest through increased awareness of our brands for the employees of our corporate partners. Corporate partnerships provide us with an opportunity to educate students that are not as easily accessible through our standard marketing. Students who attend our institutions through corporate partnerships are awarded grants from the applicable university to partially offset their tuition costs, the amount of which depends on the agreement with each respective corporate partner. The lower tuition billed to these students results in lower revenue per student on a daily basis, yet recruiting, marketing and support costs associated with these students are lower. Further, these students are more likely to start class and tend to be more persistent in their pursuit of long-term learning, which we believe will result in higher life-time value per student. We continue to see student enrollments from corporate partnerships increase as we continue to expand the program to new corporate partners. Approximately 16.7% and 6.4% of CTU and AIU’s total student population as of December 31, 2018, respectively, are a result of corporate partnership agreements.

Admissions
 CEC serves a diverse student population. Our students represent a broad range of educational and employment experiences, contributing to their college-level readiness. Each of our University Group institutions has an admissions department that is responsible for interacting with individuals interested in applying to an institution. Admissions advisors serve as prospective students’ primary contacts, providing information to help them make informed enrollment decisions and assisting them with the completion of the enrollment process. The admission advisors also have a responsibility to provide guidance and support through the application process and orientation as well as assist each student as they transition to their first class.
 CEC has invested in multiple admissions center locations in order to better assist students through the admissions process. CEC has made additional investments in its Illinois admissions and advising centers along with opening two new admissions and advising centers in Chandler and Tempe, Arizona. These investments have been made over the past two years and have enabled us to better meet student demand. 
 The admissions and entrance processes for our institutions are intended to identify students who are interested in meeting the requirements of their chosen program of study. We believe that a success-oriented student body ultimately results in higher student retention, increased student and employer satisfaction, and lower default rates on government loans utilized by a student. Generally, to be qualified for admission to one of our institutions, an applicant must have received a high school diploma or a recognized equivalent, such as a General Education Development certificate. Some of our programs may also require applicants to meet other program admissions requirements.
 Our student financial aid team works with students so that they are able to start their education with the knowledge of what loans and grants are available to them and complete the financial aid application process in a timely manner, thus providing them with the capability of funding their education. Our staff assists students so they can determine an appropriate funding solution for their educational needs as well as provides information regarding the transfer of credit into the institution. 
 Our online orientation process encourages students to engage actively in preparatory activities which can include a personalized learning module, a discussion board assignment and an individual project. This orientation program also provides the opportunity for students to understand our academic and support services. We believe completion of these activities will better prepare a student to make an informed decision about pursuing their education as well as to be more successful as it simulates their classroom experience both online and in a campus-based environment. Campus-based students have the opportunity to engage with faculty, staff and current students during orientation which builds confidence and a comfort level in their new learning environment. Orientation is offered to all students; completion of orientation does not financially obligate students nor does it require students to continue their education with the university.
 Student Retention and Academic Outcomes
 We emphasize the importance of student retention at each of our institutions. As is the case at any postsecondary educational institution, a portion of our students fail to complete their academic programs for a variety of academic, financial or personal reasons. We employ student advisors that provide feedback and assistance to students during their course of study. We seek to improve retention rates by building a strong connection between our faculty and students and promoting instructional innovation, such as our M.U.S.E. instructional platform and our student and faculty mobile applications. These efforts, as well as our intellipath personalized learning technology, are designed to assist our students to remain in school and succeed. 
 Our student advising model promotes specific and deliberate collaboration between faculty and advisors which we believe elevates accountability and effectiveness between these two areas, which in turn, provides students with consistent support and communication. Student advisors continue to work with students throughout their program to provide relevant and specific feedback and guidance as they progress through their classes. Additionally, a team of staff members from advising, admissions and financial aid work directly with each new student creating a student-service atmosphere and encouraging quality interactions. 
 Coupled with the student advising model, CTU and AIU have made changes to course sequencing to build workload levels slowly as students develop skills and acclimate to course expectations. Courses have been redesigned to accommodate skill development holistically in the first eight courses, which we believe will support incremental and progressive learning.
 AIU has fully transitioned to a graduate team model operating structure. The graduate team model structure personalizes student facing services in financial aid, admissions and advising and we believe this structure helps increase accountability and ultimately improves overall student experiences and retention. This cross-functional strategy is aimed at improving student engagement prior to beginning school and continuing through their academic program, with particular emphasis on the important onboarding phase and first academic term as the students adjust to their academic program. These teams also facilitate completion of the financial aid process and continue to provide support as students work towards graduating in their field of study.
 We have also implemented a new student engagement and retention analytics tool at CTU during the fourth quarter of 2018. This tool is intended to better help us reach the right student at the right time with the right support, which we expect will increase rates of overall course completion by our students.
 6

Preparing students to find employment in their field of study is also an important element of our educational mission. To this end, each of our institutions provides career services assistance to help prepare students to conduct a successful job search and to help identify job opportunities with employers.
 Student Enrollments Statistics
 Our total University Group student enrollments as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately 34,400 students and 34,700 students, respectively. Included in total student enrollments were approximately 32,100 students and 32,300 students, respectively, enrolled in our University Group fully-online academic programs. Related student enrollment demographic information for our University Group as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:

Academic Quality and Integrity
 We believe academic outcomes and career readiness are attained by our students as a result of the quality learning experience they are provided. Those learning experiences are facilitated by career-oriented program development, engaging instructional delivery and qualified faculty.
Program Development
 Our universities develop and deliver a variety of programs resulting in the award of credentials ranging from certificates to master’s and doctoral degrees in career-oriented programs of study in core curricula areas of business studies, information technology and health education.
 CEC’s curricula, instructional delivery tools, and experienced faculty comprise the learning experience that appeals to our student population and provides them with a unique opportunity to develop the knowledge, skills and competencies required for specific careers. The curriculum development process focuses on desired career needs, while considering relative competencies necessary to achieve these career needs, as well as recommendations set forth by advisory boards, programmatic accrediting agencies 
 7

and industry standards. Subsequently, learning objectives are identified and courses are developed which foster student engagement in activities and optimally result in the attainment of program learning outcomes. 
 Instructional Delivery
 CEC’s instructional delivery is based upon the belief that learning is dependent upon instructional methodologies that facilitate student engagement with the instructor, with other students and with the course content. This engagement is fundamental to student learning outcomes, regardless of whether instruction occurs within a physical or virtual classroom. 
 Construction of, and ongoing enhancement to, a virtual campus that engages online students with their instructor, their peers and the content is critical to the achievement of student learning outcomes. CEC’s online instructional delivery is accomplished utilizing an innovative, student-focused learning management system. While online content delivery is very common today, CEC’s course content delivery system, M.U.S.E. (My Unique Student Experience), has several features that make it distinctive in the education marketplace. Designed around the students, M.U.S.E. is a rich, engaging student experience that represents an innovative online method of delivering content.
 CEC continues to invest in its methods for delivering online education. CEC has implemented the use of sophisticated personalized learning technologies, referred to as intellipath, within our university institutions. Our roll-out of these technological tools is coupled with extensive faculty training. Continuous assessment facilitates the development of individualized, dynamic learning maps that both illustrate where student mastery has been achieved and where additional work is needed. Both the student and the instructor can see in real time where learning has taken place and where effort still needs to be applied. Additionally, students have access to a mobile application and two-way messaging platform which were created to complement students’ mobile-centric lives. The student benefits of these enhancements include motivating students and helping them connect with the university and remain on track with their course of study.
 Faculty
 CEC institutions employ approximately 1,900 credentialed, geographically disbursed, full-time and adjunct (i.e., part-time) faculty who facilitate learning in our classrooms and virtual classrooms. Our faculty are hired, assigned, developed and evaluated in accordance with current accepted higher education practices and in accordance with state, institutional accreditation and programmatic accreditation standards. Generally, our institutions require the instructor to have a degree at least one level higher than the level of course being taught (with the exception of faculty in our doctoral programs) plus teaching and/or industry experience. General education faculty members must possess at least a master’s degree. The average tenure of a CEC faculty member is greater than six years. We believe the longevity of our instructors is a testament to the focus we place on student learning and the consistent quality we strive for in our classrooms.
Faculty Competencies
 With the input of faculty and academic leadership at our institutions, we have developed a set of instructor competencies that we believe are critical to student success and institutional effectiveness. These competencies provide the basis for faculty recruitment, hiring, orientation, evaluation and development. The competencies apply to all instructors, regardless of content area, instructional platform (campus-based or online) and employment status (full-time or part-time). Faculty hired by any CEC institution must demonstrate proficiency in each of the following competencies:

• | communication;
--+---------------


• | assessment of student learning;
--+--------------------------------


• | instructional methodology (pedagogy);
--+--------------------------------------


• | subject matter expertise;
--+--------------------------


• | utilization of technology to enhance teaching and learning;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | acknowledgement and accommodation of diversity in learners;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | student engagement;
--+--------------------


• | promotion of active student learning;
--+--------------------------------------


• | compliance with academic and institution policy; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | demonstration of scholarship.
--+------------------------------

Compliance with Regulations
 We focus on operating and achieving results in a compliant and ethical manner. Specialized staff review, interpret and establish procedures for compliance with regulations governing financial assistance programs and processing financial aid applications. Because Title IV Programs are required to be administered in accordance with the standard of care and diligence of a fiduciary, any regulatory violation can be the basis for disciplinary action, including suspension of participation in Title IV Programs, as well as a limitation or termination proceeding against one or both of our institutions. 
 Our institutions undergo an annual independent compliance audit for all Title IV Programs as well as a variety of other compliance submissions to and reviews from ED, the Department of Veteran’s Affairs, various state licensing agencies and institutional accreditors. CEC’s efforts to maintain compliance with all of these regulatory requirements are extensive and include: 
  
• | corporate and institutional resource teams that respond to student concerns;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | robust institutional effectiveness programs at each institution focused on continuous improvement;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a centralized corporate financial aid quality assurance team that continuously audits financial aid packaging, awarding, disbursements and returns to ensure compliance with ED, Department of Veterans Affairs or other requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a centralized data and reporting team responsible for consistency in methodologies for calculating and supporting the various reports to regulators or the public;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an internal audit function reporting directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors that audits and regularly monitors our operations, including compliance with regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a legal and regulatory group that assists with the development and implementation of procedures and process controls and monitors execution to maintain compliance with federal and state regulations, as well as monitoring of federal and state regulatory developments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a compliance team that is responsible for the review and approval of student and public communications and media including advertising materials, web content and maintaining internal and external advertising standards;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regular monitoring of recorded phone calls in order to support efforts to maintain quality student interactions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | use of compliance-approved materials when speaking to potential and current students; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | required annual ethics training for all employees and quarterly compliance certifications for staff engaged in student marketing, recruitment, financial aid counseling and processing, career services and campus leadership.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Innovation and Collaboration
 We focus on driving a culture of innovation and collaboration. This is evidenced by our technology innovations in recent years, including our personalized learning platform, student and faculty mobile applications with the addition of two-way messaging and a student engagement and retention analytics tool, all of which are discussed further above. We believe that these innovations continue to provide students with tools that enable them to focus on educational content in a manner that is best suited to their personal learning style. Our focus on collaboration is evidenced by the successful implementation of these technology initiatives as well as how these innovations are designed to promote more effective and efficient collaboration between faculty, advisors and students. AIU’s implementation of the graduate team model is another example of this focus on collaboration which drives a student-service atmosphere and encourages quality interactions. Our teams have also collaborated to implement operational efficiencies in an effort to improve the student experience across the student lifecycle. We will continue our focus on innovation and collaboration to improve student experiences, retention and academic outcomes.

ACCREDITATION AND JURISDICTIONAL AUTHORIZATIONS
 Institutional Accreditation
 In the United States, accreditation is a process through which an institution subjects itself to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions. Accrediting agencies primarily examine the academic quality of the instructional programs of an institution, and a grant of accreditation is generally viewed as confirmation that an institution’s programs meet generally accepted academic standards. Accrediting agencies also review the administrative and financial operations of the institutions they accredit to ensure that each institution has the resources to meet its educational mission.
 Pursuant to provisions of the Higher Education Act, ED relies on accrediting agencies to determine whether institutions’ educational programs qualify the institutions to participate in Title IV Programs. The Higher Education Act and its implementing regulations specify certain standards that all recognized accrediting agencies must adopt in connection with their review of postsecondary institutions.
 Both CTU and AIU are accredited by The Higher Learning Commission (“HLC”) (www.hlcommission.org), one of six regional accreditation agencies recognized by ED. AIU’s next re-affirmation of accreditation is scheduled for 2023-24. AIU had a comprehensive evaluation in 2018, during which HLC found that AIU continued to meet HLC’s criteria for accreditation. CTU’s next re-affirmation of accreditation is scheduled for 2022-23. CTU had a comprehensive evaluation in 2017, during which HLC found that CTU continued to meet HLC’s criteria for accreditation, while requesting that CTU complete some interim reporting prior to its next re-affirmation of accreditation review.
 Programmatic Accreditation 
 In addition to the institutional accreditation described above, CTU and AIU have specialized programmatic accreditation for particular educational programs. Many states and professional associations require professional programs to be accredited at a program level, and require individuals who must pass professional license exams to have graduated from accredited programs. Programmatic accreditation does not satisfy ED requirements to confer Title IV Program eligibility; however, it does provide additional quality review by peers in a given field and may enable or assist graduates to practice, sit for licensing or certification exams (in some cases) or otherwise secure appropriate employment in their chosen field. In addition to programmatic accreditation, some states have licensing boards which regulate who in a state is licensed to practice in a given profession.
 Our schools pursue programmatic accreditation if that accreditation is required by employers or licensing bodies in order for a graduate to practice the profession or if it is required in order for a graduate to sit for a licensing or certification exam in order to practice or advance in the profession. In some cases, programmatic accreditation is sought because it is desired by employers and may enhance the ability of our graduates to compete for employment in their field.
 Programmatic accreditation has been granted by the following accrediting agencies for the following individual programs offered by our University Group institutions.

----+--------------------------------

State Authorization
 State licensing agencies are responsible for the oversight of educational institutions, and continued approval by such agencies is necessary for an institution to operate and grant degrees or certificates to its students. State laws establish standards for, among other things, student instruction, qualifications of faculty, location and nature of facilities, and financial policies. State laws and regulations may limit our campuses’ ability to operate or to award degrees or certificates or offer new programs. Moreover, under the Higher Education Act, approval by such agencies is necessary to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs. As a result, we are subject to regulation in the states where our physical campuses or administrative offices are located. Currently, each of our ground-based campuses is authorized by the state in which it is located. Additionally, our online institutions have sought separate state approval or recognition from the relevant state agency via participation in a consortia program called the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (“SARA”) in the states in which they enroll and/or recruit students.
 SARA is an agreement among member states, districts and U.S. territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance education courses and programs. States, districts and territories apply to become members of SARA (which, in many cases, requires action by state legislators) and if accepted, institutions approved in their “home” state may apply to become participants in the SARA compact and the “home” state authorization is deemed acceptable to operate an online program in other states that also participate in SARA as long as they do not establish a “physical presence” in those other states (as defined by SARA). As of January 1, 2019, 49 states plus the District of Columbia are SARA participants (www.nc-sara.org). AIU and CTU are approved to participate in SARA by their home states (Illinois and Colorado, respectively). California is the only state which is not a part of SARA; CTU and AIU hold the appropriate approval in that state.
           ED had published new regulations, to be effective July 1, 2018, that condition Title IV Program eligibility on confirmation that an institution has the appropriate state approvals from any state which requires institutions to obtain its approval. These new regulations recognize SARA participation as a means to qualify in a state through reciprocity. However, the implementation of these regulations was delayed until July 1, 2020, based on concerns raised by regulated parties and ED is currently considering potential modifications to the regulations through a negotiated rulemaking process focused on accreditation and innovation.
 Additional State Regulatory Matters
 In recent years, states have increased their focus on the private, postsecondary education sector. This includes increased activity by state attorneys general in their review of the sector. In this regard, on January 3, 2019, the Company entered into agreements with attorneys general from 48 states and the District of Columbia to bring closure to multi-state inquiries ongoing since January 2014. As part of the agreements, the Company expressly denies any allegations of wrongdoing but agreed to, among other things, work with a third-party administrator that will report annually on the Company’s compliance with various obligations the Company committed to in the agreements. Operationally, the Company committed to:

• | provide students with additional communication of important policies, academic program information and financial aid information during the enrollment process, including a single page program disclosure as well as disclosure of applicable refund policies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide newly enrolling students an online financial aid interactive tool that can assist them in understanding their financial commitments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 11

 
• | continue its existing practice of offering a no cost orientation and/or an introductory course with materials designed to support new college students (if they have less than 24 college credits); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | permit undergraduate students to withdraw with no monetary obligation up to seven days after their first class at on-campus schools and up to 21 days after the start of the term at online programs (if they have less than 24 online college credits).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 From a compliance standpoint, the Company committed to:
  
• | continue many of its existing compliance programs that it uses to monitor for accurate communication with prospective students;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continue its monitoring of third-party marketing vendors and agreed on a process to continue to hold them accountable for complying with the Company’s advertising guidelines;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continue to monitor and review conversations that its admissions and financial aid staff have with prospective students during the student recruitment process; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enhance current training to staff working with students regarding the additional information and tools that are part of the commitments in the agreements.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Generally, the operational aspects we agreed to as part of the agreements with the attorneys general are for a six-year period. See Note 12 “Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements and Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate – Any failure to comply with state laws and regulatory requirements, or new state legislative or regulatory initiatives affecting our institutions, could have a material adverse effect on our total student enrollments, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows,” for more information about these agreements.
           Additionally, on August 19, 2013, the Company entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance with the New York Attorney General. Under the terms of this agreement, without admitting or denying any findings by the New York Attorney General, the Company agreed to, among other things: calculate and disclose placement rates according to agreed upon procedures and retain an independent consultant or audit firm to independently verify and report on such placement rates and to teach out programs going forward that do not achieve a 47.5% minimum placement rate. CTU Online and AIU Online have each reported and published this additional agreed upon placement rate which only includes New York resident graduates. For the 2018 reporting year, none of the rates required to be calculated for CTU Online and AIU Online were below the minimum threshold required by the Assurance of Discontinuance. The Company’s remaining campus in New York closed in 2018 and therefore no further action should be necessary with respect to programs which report rates below the minimum threshold. The Company has now completed all material terms of this agreement.
 STUDENT FINANCIAL AID AND RELATED FEDERAL REGULATION
 Many of our students require assistance in financing their education. Our institutions are approved to participate in the U.S. Department of Education’s Title IV federal aid programs. Our institutions also participate in a number of state financial aid programs, tuition assistance programs of the United States Armed Forces and education benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Our institutions that participate in federal and state financial aid programs are subject to extensive regulatory requirements imposed by federal and state government agencies, and other standards imposed by educational accrediting bodies.
Nature of Federal Support for Postsecondary Education in the United States
 The U.S. government provides a substantial portion of its support for postsecondary education in the form of Title IV Program grants, loans and work-study programs to students who can use those funds to finance certain education related expenses at any institution that has been approved to participate by ED. These federal programs are authorized by the Higher Education Act. While most students are eligible for a Title IV loan, typically, financial aid administered under Title IV is awarded on the basis of financial need, which is generally defined under the Higher Education Act as the difference between the costs associated with attending an institution and the amount a student’s family can reasonably be expected to contribute based on a federally determined formula. Among other things, recipients of Title IV Program funds must maintain a satisfactory grade point average and progress in a timely manner toward completion of their program of study.
 Students at our institutions may receive grants, loans and work-study opportunities to fund their education under the Title IV Programs described in the sections below. In addition, some students at our institutions receive education related benefits pursuant to certain programs for veterans and military personnel, the most significant of which are described further below.
 Federal Student and Parent Loans
 ED’s major form of aid includes loans to students and parents through the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (“Direct Loan”) Program. Direct Loans are loans made directly by the U.S. Government to students or their parents. The Direct Loan program offers Federal Direct Stafford, Federal Direct PLUS (which provides loans to parents of dependent students and to graduate or professional students, known as Parent PLUS and Grad PLUS) and Federal Direct Consolidation Loans. 
 12

Undergraduate students who have demonstrated financial need may be eligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan, with ED paying the interest on this loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time in school. Graduate and undergraduate students who do not demonstrate financial need may be eligible to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. Graduate/professional students may only receive Direct Unsubsidized Loans. With Direct Unsubsidized Loans the student is responsible for the interest while in school and after leaving school, although actual interest payments generally may be deferred by the student until after he or she has left school. Students who are eligible for a Direct Subsidized Loan may also be eligible to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan.
 A student is not required to meet any specific credit scoring criteria to receive a Direct Loan, but any student with a default on a prior loan made under any Title IV Program or who has been convicted under federal or state law of selling or possessing drugs while receiving federal aid may not be eligible. ED has established maximum annual and aggregate borrowing limits for Direct Loans.
 The Direct PLUS Loan Program provides loans to either the parents of dependent students (Direct Parent PLUS) or to graduate students (Direct Grad PLUS). Parents and graduate students who have an acceptable credit history may borrow a Direct PLUS Loan to pay the education related expenses of a child who is a dependent (Direct Parent PLUS) or a graduate student (Direct Grad PLUS) enrolled at least half-time at our eligible institutions. The amount of a Direct PLUS Loan cannot exceed the student’s cost of attendance less all other financial aid received. 
 Federal Pell Grant and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant
 Title IV Program grants are generally made to our students under the Federal Pell Grant (“Pell Grant”) program and the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (“FSEOG”) program. The 2018-19 maximum annual Pell Grant is $6,095, excluding any additional amount awarded pursuant to a year-round Pell Grant. Beginning with the 2017-18 award year, eligible students may receive year-round Pell Grant funds. A year-round Pell Grant program allows students to receive up to 150% of the student’s regular grant award over the course of the academic year, allowing students to maintain their enrollment status and receive Pell Grant funds for the entire calendar year so that they can continue taking classes and work toward graduating more quickly. To be eligible for the additional Pell Grant funds, the student must be enrolled at least half-time in the payment period(s) for which the student receives the additional Pell Grant funds in excess of 100% of the student’s regular Pell Grant award. 
 The FSEOG program awards are designed to supplement Pell Grants up to a maximum amount of $4,000 per academic year for the neediest students. Our institutions are required to provide matching funding for FSEOG awards that represent not less than 25% of the total FSEOG award to be received by eligible students. The matching may be accomplished through institutional, private and/or state funds.
 Federal Work-Study Program
 Generally, under the federal work-study program, federal funds are used to pay 75% of the cost of part-time employment of eligible students to perform work for the institution or certain off-campus organizations. The remaining 25% is paid by the institution or the student’s employer. In select cases, these federal funds under the federal work-study program are used to pay up to 100% of the cost of part-time employment of eligible students.
Veterans Benefits Programs
 Some of our students who are veterans use their benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill or the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, as amended (“Post-9/11 GI Bill”), to cover their tuition. A certain number of our students are also eligible to receive funds from other education assistance programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
 The Yellow Ribbon program under the Post-9/11 GI Bill expanded education benefits for veterans who have served on active duty on or after September 11, 2001, including reservists and members of the National Guard. As originally passed, the Post-9/11 GI Bill provided that eligible veterans could receive benefits for tuition purposes up to the cost of in-state tuition at the most expensive public institution of higher education in the state where the veteran was enrolled. In addition, veterans who were enrolled in classroom-based programs or “blended programs” (programs that combine classroom learning and distance learning) could receive monthly housing stipends, while veterans enrolled in wholly distance-based programs were not entitled to a monthly housing stipend. The provisions regarding education benefits for post-9/11 veterans took effect August 1, 2009. The Post-9/11 GI Bill also increased the amount of education benefits available to eligible veterans under the pre-existing Montgomery GI Bill. The legislation also authorized expansion of service members’ ability to transfer veterans’ education benefits to family members.
 On January 4, 2011, the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010 (“Improvements Act”) was adopted, which amends the Post-9/11 GI Bill in several respects. The Improvements Act alters the way benefits related to tuition and fees are calculated. For nonpublic U.S. institutions, the Improvements Act bases the benefits related to tuition and fees on the net cost to the student (after accounting for state and federal aid, scholarships, institutional aid, fee waivers, and similar assistance paid directly to the institution for the sole purpose of defraying tuition cost) rather than the charges established by the institution. The Improvements Act also replaced the state-dependent benefit cap with a single national cap which is adjusted annually and as of August 1, 2018 is $23,672. In addition, veterans pursuing a program of education solely through distance learning on a more than half-time basis are eligible to receive up to 50% of the national average of the basic housing allowance available to service members who are at 
 13

military pay grade E-5 and have dependents. Most “Improvements Act” changes took effect on August 1 or October 1, 2011, though changes to rules regarding eligibility for benefits were effective immediately or retroactively to the effective date of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The Improvements Act did not change the Post-9/11 GI Bill’s provision that allows veterans to receive up to $1,000 per academic year for books, supplies, equipment and other education costs.
 U.S. Military Tuition Assistance
 Service members of the United States Armed Forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of service through the Uniform Tuition Assistance Program of the Department of Defense (“DoD”). Service members may use this tuition assistance to pursue postsecondary degrees at postsecondary institutions that are accredited by accrediting agencies that are recognized by ED. Each branch of the armed forces has established its own rules for the tuition assistance programs of DoD.
 In 2010, both the U.S. Congress and DoD increased their focus on DoD tuition assistance that is used for distance education and programs at for-profit institutions. The DoD Voluntary Education Partnership Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) was established as part of the revised DoD Instruction 1322.25, Voluntary Education Programs dated March 15, 2011. The MOU increases oversight of educational programs offered to active duty service members and conveys the commitments and agreements between the educational institution and DoD prior to accepting funds under the tuition assistance program. For example, the MOU requires an institution to agree to support DoD regulatory guidance, adhere to a bill of rights that is specified in the regulations, and participate in the proposed Military Voluntary Education Review program. Under the MOU, institutions must also agree to adhere to the principles and criteria established by the Service Members Opportunity Colleges Degree Network System regarding the transferability of credit and the awarding of credit for military training and experience. Both CTU and AIU signed this earlier version of the DoD’s standard MOU.
 In August 2013, DoD began incorporating the Principles of Excellence outlined in the President’s 2012 Executive Order into their current MOU. Refer to the section below for more information on the Principles of Excellence.
 In May 2014, DoD released a final version of its revised MOU and its changes include efforts to enhance departmental oversight of voluntary education programs as well as incorporate the remaining requirements as stated in the President's 2012 Executive Order. The new provisions apply to all educational institutions providing education programs through the DoD tuition assistance program. Among other things, the MOU requests that participating institutions provide meaningful information to students about the financial cost and attendance at an institution so military students can make informed decisions on where to attend school, will not use unfair, deceptive, and abusive recruiting practices and will provide academic and student support services to service members and their families. The revised MOU also implemented rules to strengthen existing procedures for access to DoD installations by educational institutions, a DoD postsecondary education complaint system for service members, spouses, and adult family members to register student complaints and established authorization for the military departments to establish service-specific tuition assistance eligibility criteria and management controls. In September 2014, both CTU and AIU signed DoD’s revised MOU.
 2012 Executive Order Regarding Military and Veterans Education Benefits
 On April 27, 2012, the President issued an executive order regarding the establishment of Principles of Excellence for educational institutions receiving funding from federal military and veterans educational benefits programs, including those provided by the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Uniform Tuition Assistance Program of the DoD. The executive order requires DoD, the Department of Veterans Affairs and ED to establish and implement “Principles of Excellence” to apply to educational institutions receiving such funding. The goals of the Principles are broadly stated in the order and relate to disclosures of costs and amounts of costs covered by federal educational benefits, marketing standards, state authorization, accreditation approvals, standard institutional refund policies, educational plans and academic and financial advising. Various implementation mechanisms are included, along with the development and implementation of the “VA Shopping Sheet,” a standardized cost form with federal aid information. While additional administrative support has been required to comply with the executive order, the overall impact to the Company has not been material.
Institutional Payment Plans 

 Some of our students will enter into institutional payment plans with our institutions to pay a portion, or occasionally all, of their institutional charges directly to the school. This is more common for students who have a gap between their Title IV financial aid funding and other third party aid available to them and the institutional charges. We offer these payment plans over the in-school period, and up to 12 months beyond graduation. The payment plans do not include any interest or fees.
 Eligibility and Certification by ED
 Under the provisions of the Higher Education Act, an institution must apply to ED for continued certification to participate in Title IV Programs at least every six years or when it undergoes a change of control. In addition, an institution must obtain ED approval for certain substantial changes in its operations, including changes in an institution’s accrediting agency or state authorizing agency or changes to an institution’s structure or certain basic educational features.
 14

Institutions approved to participate in Title IV sign a program participation agreement provided by ED that describes the terms of participation and includes a number of certifications and assurances made by the chief executive officer of the institutions. As long as an institution has submitted an application for re-certification prior to the expiration of its current program participation agreement, the institution’s eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs continues on a month-to-month basis until ED completes its review. ED may issue full certification to an institution, it may deny certification or it may elect to issue provisional certification, in which case the program participation agreement outlines additional requirements that the institution must meet.
 ED may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all required eligibility and certification standards. Provisional certification does not generally limit an institution’s access to Title IV Program funds. ED may withdraw an institution’s provisional certification without advance notice if ED determines that the institution is not fulfilling all material requirements.
 Our institutions are currently operating on provisional program participation agreements. CTU and AIU each have a program participation agreement that expired on September 30, 2018 and as a result are operating on a month-to-month approval pending ED’s review and processing of their pending applications for recertification. During the period of provisional certification, our institutions must obtain prior ED approval to add an educational program, open a new location or make any other significant change. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate – If ED denies, or significantly conditions, recertification of any of our institutions to participate in Title IV Programs, that institution could not conduct its business as it is currently conducted,” and other risk factors in Item 1A for additional information about the risks surrounding continued participation in Title IV Programs.
 Scrutiny of the For-Profit, Postsecondary Education Sector
 In recent years, Congress, ED, states, accrediting agencies, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), state attorneys general and the media have scrutinized the for-profit, postsecondary education sector. Congressional hearings and roundtable discussions were held regarding various aspects of the education industry, including issues surrounding student debt as well as publicly reported student outcomes that may be used as part of an institution’s recruiting and admissions practices, and reports were issued that are highly critical of for-profit colleges and universities. A group of influential U.S. senators, consumer advocacy groups and some media outlets have strongly and repeatedly encouraged ED, the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs and its state approving agencies to take action to limit or terminate the participation of institutions such as ours in existing tuition assistance programs.
 Any actions that limit our participation in Title IV Programs or the amount of student financial aid for which our students are eligible would negatively impact our business. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate.”
 Legislative Action and Recent ED Regulatory Initiatives
 The U.S. Congress must periodically reauthorize the Higher Education Act and other laws governing Title IV Programs and annually determines the funding level for each Title IV Program.
 The Higher Education Opportunity Act (“HEOA”) was the most recent reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and was signed into law on August 14, 2008. It was immediately effective for many items with others effective in subsequent years. The HEOA authorized increases in the Federal Pell Grants, changed certain grant eligibility requirements, expanded Stafford Loan deferment options, provided changes to needs analysis, changed treatment of Veterans Administration benefits effective with the 2010-11 award year and revised many of the regulations governing an institution’s eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.
 Historically, Congress has reauthorized the Higher Education Act every five to six years. The last full reauthorization took place in 2008 and Congress has subsequently taken several actions which effectively extend the Higher Education Act and various Title IV Programs on a temporary basis. We anticipate that Congress will work to either reauthorize the Higher Education Act in its entirety or pass a series of smaller bills that focus on individual parts of the Higher Education Act, primarily Title IV Programs. Certain legislation has been introduced that is focused on simplifying both access to and repayment of Title IV funds. While it is uncertain whether those proposals will be enacted into law, simplifying the federal student aid programs and reducing the complexity of repayment should be of benefit to our students. However, scrutiny of the for-profit postsecondary education sector and the ongoing policy differences in Congress regarding spending levels could lead to significant regulatory changes in connection with the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, and many of these changes may be adverse to postsecondary institutions generally or for-profit institutions specifically. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate – Congress may revise laws governing Title IV Programs or reduce funding for those programs which could reduce our enrollments and revenue and increase costs of operations.”
 In recent years, ED has engaged in significant rulemaking efforts intended to develop new regulations focused on various topics. These efforts led to adoption of the new gainful employment regulation and “borrower defense to repayment” regulations. See the “Compliance with Federal Regulatory Standards and Effect of Federal Regulatory Violations” section below for a description of these regulations as they were adopted. ED convened new negotiated rulemaking committees to consider modifications to these borrower 
 15

defense to repayment regulations as well as the gainful employment regulation in late 2017 and early 2018. On July 31, 2018, ED published for public comment proposed regulations with respect to “borrower defense to repayment” and on August 14, 2018 ED published for public comment a proposed rescission of the gainful employment regulations. ED has not indicated when it plans to publish final regulations on either topic and there have been various legal challenges to ED’s rulemaking processes and administrative decisions; however, any regulations published in final form by November 1, 2019 typically would take effect on July 1, 2020. The outcome of these rulemaking initiatives and the impact of any new or modified regulations are uncertain at this time.
 Compliance with Federal Regulatory Standards and Effect of Federal Regulatory Violations
 To be eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, an institution must comply with the Higher Education Act and regulations thereunder that are administered by ED. We and our institutions are regularly subject to audits and compliance reviews and periodically subject to inquiries, lawsuits, investigations, and/or claims of non-compliance from federal and state regulatory agencies, accrediting agencies, ED, present and former students and employees, and others that may allege violations of statutes, regulations, accreditation standards or other regulatory requirements applicable to us or our institutions. If the results of any such audits, reviews, investigations, claims or actions are unfavorable to us, we may be required to pay monetary damages or be subject to fines, operational limitations, loss of federal funding, injunctions, additional oversight and reporting, provisional certification or other civil or criminal penalties. In addition, if ED or another regulatory agency determined that one of our institutions improperly disbursed Title IV Program funds or violated a provision of the Higher Education Act or ED’s regulations, that institution could be required to repay such funds, and could be assessed an administrative fine. See Note 12 “Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of current matters.
 In July 2015, ED conducted an ordinary course on-site program review of AIU’s administration of Title IV Programs in which the institution participates. The review covered the 2014-2015 award year with a specific focus on the programs the institution offers via distance education. We have remained responsive to any information requests from ED in this regard; however, we have not yet received the initial program review report.  
 The Higher Education Act also requires that an institution’s administration of Title IV Program funds be audited annually by an independent accounting firm and that the resulting audit report be submitted to ED for review. In September 2016, ED’s Office of Inspector General released a revised audit guide applicable specifically to proprietary schools and third-party servicers administering Title IV programs. The updated guide is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2016. The revised audit guide was effective for us for the year ending December 31, 2017 and applies to annual compliance audits due June 30, 2018 and thereafter. The new guide significantly increases the requirements and testing procedures necessary when filing our annual Title IV compliance audits. 
 Gainful Employment
 CEC institutions, and most other for-profit institutions, qualify for Title IV Program participation on the basis that they offer programs that, in addition to meeting other requirements, “prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation.” During 2013, ED established negotiated rulemaking committees, one specifically designed to limit Title IV availability for programs at for-profit institutions by defining gainful employment in a recognized occupation. On October 30, 2014, ED published a new complex final regulation, effective July 1, 2015, to define “gainful employment” as meeting certain standards measuring the general amount students borrow for enrollment in a program against an amount of their reported earnings. Prior to this rulemaking, the term gainful employment had been used in the Higher Education Act for forty years, and had not been further defined by Congress or ED. A summary of the gainful employment regulation that took effect on July 1, 2015 is set forth below.
 On June 14, 2017, ED announced its intention to convene new negotiated rulemaking committees to consider modifications to the gainful employment regulation. Committee negotiations commenced in late 2017. During negotiations, ED considered different options for adopting a uniform set of requirements that could be applicable to all schools and not specifically targeted at for-profit institutions. On August 14, 2018, ED published for public comment a proposal to rescind the gainful employment regulation which became effective on July 1, 2015. In lieu of the complex gainful employment regulation designed to eliminate program eligibility, ED indicated its intent to update the college scorecards ED had developed, which apply to all Title IV eligible institutions, with relevant information for prospective students. ED has not indicated when or if it will publish a final regulation rescinding the existing gainful employment regulation; however there have been various legal challenges to ED’s rulemaking processes and administrative decisions which may impact the outcome of the timing or finalization of the proposed rescission. The outcome of these rulemaking initiatives and the impact of any new or modified regulations are uncertain at this time.
 Current Regulation. The definition effective July 1, 2015 establishes a formula by which ED will determine if a program is eligible to participate in Title IV Programs. The regulation requires graduates of programs within three years (or less) beyond graduation to, on average, have debt with annual loan payments that are less than 8% of their annual earnings or 20% of their discretionary income. Programs whose graduates have debt with annual loan payments that accounts for between 8% and 12% of their annual earnings, or between 20% and 30% of their discretionary income, will be considered to be in the “zone” for meeting the gainful employment standard. Programs whose graduates have debt with annual loan payments that are greater than 12% of annual earnings or 30% of discretionary income will fail the gainful employment test. Institutions with a program that fails to meet the gainful employment test for two out of three consecutive years, or that is in the zone (or fails) for four consecutive years, lose eligibility for 
 16

that program to participate in Title IV Programs for at least three years. Institutions with a program that is within a year of potentially disqualifying for participation in Title IV must notify current and prospective students of the program of its potential loss of access to Title IV Program funds and the plan for continuation of the program or refunding tuition to students should the program fail to pass the gainful employment threshold in the subsequent year.
 Under the gainful employment regulation, debt is calculated based on the lesser of actual median or mean debt, or the cost of tuition, fees, books, supplies and equipment. For the first five to seven years after ED begins to report gainful employment results, depending upon the length of the academic program, ED will allow the substitution of the average debt of the most recent graduating cohort for the average debt of the measurement cohort. Earnings are to be based on data provided by the Social Security Administration to ED; however, the information sharing agreement that provided ED with access to this earnings information lapsed in May 2018 and ED has indicated that the SSA has no current intentions of renewing the agreement or providing any new earnings data to ED. As a result, only one year of gainful employment rates have been published and it is unclear if a second or subsequent year of GE program rates will ever be published. Under the regulations, institutions have an opportunity to review and correct the list of students submitted to the Social Security Administration for the earnings query, but do not have an opportunity to inspect, review, question or appeal the results provided by the Social Security Administration.
 The gainful employment regulation includes a requirement that institutions disclose program level cohort default rates if directed to do so by ED.
 On January 8, 2017, final initial year gainful employment rates were published publicly for all institutions subject to the rules. The announcement was made with an ED press release stating that over 800 programs had not met its new criteria for gainful employment and another 1,239 programs were in the “zone” for meeting the gainful employment standard. In line with our expectations, AIU had two, and CTU had three, of its continuing programs in the “zone” for meeting the gainful employment standard. Each university also had one active program that initially failed to meet the standard for the first year, but that timely filed an appeal that is pending with ED.
 Of the programs that were in the zone or failed to meet the standard, the most significant of these are the Criminal Justice programs at CTU and AIU. These programs represent approximately 16% of University Group total enrollments as of December 31, 2018. Under the current regulation, a program does not lose Title IV Program eligibility unless it fails the gainful employment test for two out of three consecutive years, or is in the zone (or fails) for four consecutive years. Because we rely on ED to provide us with the historical salary and debt information that is used in these calculations and due to the historical nature of the data used in the test, there can be no assurance that our actions will result in future compliance and the regulation could adversely affect the eligibility of the programs we offer. ED has not indicated when or if it intends to publish a second year of data for the gainful employment regulation due to both (i) the lapse of its information sharing agreement with the Social Security Administration and (ii) its proposed elimination of the regulation and associated program eligibility test. We continue to closely monitor the status of these matters and to consider new or modified programs or specializations that we believe might have improved outcomes under the current gainful employment regulation.
 The current gainful employment regulation included significant new disclosure requirements and created additional certifications to which the chief executive officer of an institution must attest, including that the programs offered by the institution meet the requirements of states or professional licensing bodies in order for graduates to practice in the field. Also included in the regulation is a requirement that any new or re-enrolled student must receive, either in person or by email, and acknowledge program level gainful employment disclosures, prior to signing an enrollment agreement, registering for classes or entering into a financial commitment with the institution. On June 30, 2017, ED announced that it was delaying aspects of the regulation requiring these program disclosures be distributed in person or via email until July 1, 2018; then subsequently in early 2018 ED announced it was again delaying this particular notification until July 1, 2019. However, the requirement that updated gainful employment disclosures be published on an institution’s program websites remains in effect and ED periodically revises the required template and data elements for these disclosures. We do not know, to the extent it becomes effective, if the new disclosure process that requires a separate email acknowledgement from our online students of program level gainful employment disclosures will have any material impact on our enrollments in the future.
 Until ED publishes a final rule rescinding the gainful employment regulation, the existing regulation remains in effect, with some aspects such as the requirement to deliver program level gainful employment disclosures to every student subject to formally announced delays, while other aspects such as the timing for publishing any second year of gainful employment rates are informally delayed pending periodic updates from ED. There can be no assurance that our future actions will result in compliance with the existing regulation or any new or modified regulation and the eligibility of the programs we offer could be adversely affected. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate - ED’s gainful employment regulation may limit the programs we can offer students and increase our cost of operations,” for more information about risks associated with the gainful employment regulation.

“90-10 Rule”
 Under a provision of the Higher Education Act commonly referred to as the “90-10 Rule,” any of our institutions that, on modified cash basis accounting, derives more than 90% of its cash receipts from Title IV sources for a fiscal year will be placed on provisional participation status for its next two fiscal years. If an institution does not satisfy the 90-10 Rule for two consecutive fiscal years, it will lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs for at least two fiscal years. We have substantially no control over the amount of Title IV student loans and grants sought by or awarded to our students. If an institution violates the 90-10 Rule and becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs but continues to disburse Title IV Program funds, ED could require repayment of all Title IV Program funds received by it after the effective date of the loss of eligibility.
 We have implemented various measures intended to reduce the percentage of our institution’s cash basis revenue attributable to Title IV Program funds, including emphasizing employer-paid and other direct-pay education programs; the use of externally funded scholarships and grants; and counseling students to carefully evaluate the amount of necessary Title IV Program borrowing.
 The ability of our institutions to maintain 90-10 rates below 90% will depend on the impact of future changes in our enrollment mix, and regulatory and other factors outside of our control, including any reduction in government assistance for military personnel, including veterans, or changes in the treatment of such funding for purposes of the 90-10 rate calculation. Changes in, or new interpretations of, the technical aspects of the calculation methodology or other industry practices under the 90-10 Rule could further significantly impact our compliance with the 90-10 Rule.
 For our 2018 fiscal year, our preliminary review of our institutions’ 90-10 Rule percentages results in none of our institutions exceeding the 90% limit. 
 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate – Our institutions could lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if the percentage of their revenues derived from those programs is too high,” for additional information regarding risks relating to the 90-10 Rule.
 Student Loan Default Rates
 An institution may lose eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV Programs if the rates at which its former students default on the repayment of their federally-guaranteed or federally-funded student loans exceed specified percentages. This is determined by an institution’s cohort default rate which is calculated on an annual basis as a measure of administrative capability. Each cohort is the group of students who first enter into student loan repayment during a federal fiscal year (ending September 30). The measurement period for the cohort default rate is a three-year period.  
 If an institution’s three-year cohort default rate exceeds 10% for any one of the three preceding years, it must delay for 30 days the release of the first disbursement of U.S. federal student loan proceeds to first time borrowers enrolled in the first year of an undergraduate program. As a matter of regular practice, all of our institutions have implemented a 30-day delay for such disbursements.
 If an institution’s three-year cohort default rate exceeds 30% for any given year, it must establish a default prevention task force and develop a default prevention plan with measurable objectives for improving the cohort default rate.
 Excessive three-year cohort default rates will result in the loss of an institution’s Title IV eligibility, as follows:
  
• | Annual test. If the three-year cohort default rate for any given year exceeds 40%, the institution will cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV Programs; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Three consecutive years test. If the institution’s three-year cohort default rate exceeds 30% for three consecutive years, the institution will cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV Programs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have student loan default management initiatives aimed at reducing the likelihood of our students’ failure to repay their loans in a timely manner. These initiatives emphasize the importance of students’ compliance with loan repayment requirements and provide for loan counseling and communication with students after they cease enrollment. Our efforts supplement the counseling, processing and other student loan servicing work performed by ED through contracts it has with select third parties. The quality and nature of the student loan servicing work performed by ED has a direct impact on our cohort default rates and we have experienced past performance failures by ED in outreach to students which adversely impact the cohort default rates at our institutions. On January 18, 2017, the largest of ED’s student loan servicers, Navient, was sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Illinois and Washington Attorneys General for allegedly failing to properly counsel and support student loan borrowers. We know many of our students have Navient as their designated student loan servicer, however we are not able to determine what impact the alleged conduct, if accurate, may have had or will have on cohort default rates.
 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate – Our institutions could lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs or have other limitations placed upon them if their student loan cohort default rates are greater than the standards set by ED,” for additional information regarding risks relating to cohort default rates. 
 18

In September 2018, ED released the official three-year cohort default rates for the 2015 cohort. Each of our institutions had cohort default rates under the 30% threshold for the 2015 cohort. A listing of the official 2015, 2014 and 2013 three-year cohort default rates, for our universities is provided in the table below. 
 
 
 | Cohort Default Rates 3-year rate
--------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------
Institution, Main Campus Location | | | 
(Additional locations as defined by accreditors are in parentheses) | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 
American InterContinental University | | | 
Schaumburg, IL (Online) (Atlanta, GA and Houston, TX) | 19.7% | 16.2% | 14.7%
Colorado Technical University | | | 
Colorado Springs, CO (Denver, CO and Online) | 19.5% | 15.7% | 14.0%

 
We continued to see an increase in both institutions’ cohort default rates through the 2015 cohort. We believe these increases were a result of multiple factors, including that certain operational changes adversely affected the 2014 and 2015 cohorts, and that the 2013 and 2014 cohorts benefitted from some timing related factors impacting the percentage of students that graduated relative to the percentage of students that withdrew without completing their program. We increased focus in this area beginning in late 2016 and as a result we do not currently anticipate further increase in our cohort default rates in the near future.
 
Borrower Defense to Repayment
 2016 Regulations - Status
On October 28, 2016, ED issued complex, significant new regulations that cover multiple issues including the processes and standards for the discharge of student loans, which are commonly referred to as “borrower defense to repayment.” The 2016 regulations were published in the Federal Register on November 1, 2016 and were generally to become effective on July 1, 2017. However, in response to pending litigation by the California Association of Private Postsecondary Schools (“CAPPS”) challenging the legality of the borrower defense to repayment regulations, on June 14, 2017 ED announced an indefinite delay in the effective date of the 2016 regulations while it conducted further review and a new negotiated rulemaking process to replace the previously adopted regulations. On October 24, 2017, ED published two related notices in the Federal Register. The first, again citing the pending litigation and uncertain outcome, was an interim final rule setting the effective date of the delayed regulations as July 1, 2018. The second, was a proposed extension of the delay for an extra year, through July 1, 2019, to permit ED to conclude its negotiated rulemaking to amend the 2016 regulations and to provide adequate time for institutions to prepare for the implementation of its modified requirements. A group of attorneys general filed a lawsuit on July 6, 2017 in federal court in the District of Columbia to challenge the legal authority for ED’s delay of the effectiveness of the 2016 borrower defense to repayment regulations. On September 12, 2018, the court ruled ED had not adequately justified its delay of the rule and offered ED 30 days to provide further justification for its delay. Separately, the rule’s legality had been challenged in the same court by CAPPS. ED declined to further justify its decision to delay the rule from becoming effective. Before the court ruled on the lifting of ED’s delay of the rule, it heard a CAPPS request for an injunction on the the rule becoming effective. On October 16, 2018 the court ruled against CAPPS’ request for an injuction and ordered the 2016 regulations to go immediately into effect. ED has publicly stated that it intends to issue guidance to institutions regarding how these regulations are to be implemented. 
 2018 Proposed Regulations - Status
Following its June 14, 2017 announcement of its intention to convene new negotiated rulemaking committees to consider modifications to the borrower defense to repayment regulations, committee negotiations commenced in late 2017. On July 31, 2018, ED published proposed regulations for public comment with respect to “borrower defense to repayment.” ED has not indicated when it plans to publish final regulations replacing the 2016 regulations. Due to the various legal challenges to ED’s rulemaking processes and administrative decisions regarding this rule, the timing for when a new rule may become effective is uncertain; however, any regulations published in final form by November 1, 2019 typically would take effect on July 1, 2020. The outcome of these rulemaking initiatives and legal proceedings and the impact of any new or modified regulations are uncertain at this time.
 2016 Regulations – Summary
A summary of the 2016 borrower defense to repayment regulations is set forth below. 
 Loan Discharge. The 2016 borrower defense to repayment regulations provide three categories of borrower defenses that can be asserted by students with student loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2017, including:

• | the institution has had a judgment issued against it in an action brought by a student or a government official or entity related to the loan or educational services in a contested proceeding;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the institution failed to perform its obligations under the terms of a contract with the student; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 19

 
• | the institution made a “substantial misrepresentation” about the nature of its programs, financial charges or employability of its graduates that the borrower reasonably relied upon on when he or she decided to attend or continue attending the institution.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the 2016 regulations authorize ED to grant loan discharge relief to an individual or group of individuals, including individuals who have not sought relief. In particular, ED may automatically discharge loans borrowed to attend schools that have closed on or after November 1, 2013 if a student that did not complete his or her program of study has not subsequently re-enrolled in another Title IV eligible school within three years. In most cases, the regulations provide that ED may seek reimbursement from the institution for any loans discharged under the new procedures. ED’s procedures permit it to draw funds from letters of credit or other collateral posted to ED to secure these types of payments or to offset against future disbursements which would adversely impact cash balances by the amount of the offset.
 In the closed school context, ED engaged in significant student outreach and actively encouraged and promoted loan discharge through its Borrower Defense Unit and in a report dated October 28, 2016, ED noted that there were over 4,000 pending applications for loan discharge from students that are unrelated to the collapse of Corinthian Colleges, a former for-profit public company competitor. On January 17, 2017, ED utilized its authority under the borrower defense to repayment rules to automatically discharge student loans for approximately 4,500 students that attended American Career Institute, a former for-profit institution with five campuses in Massachusetts. ED also has pending requests from other outside groups and State Attorneys General for further blanket discharges.
 Financial Responsibility. The 2016 regulations also make significant modifications to the existing rules governing an institution’s required financial responsibility and administrative capability. The regulations specify a number of triggering events that, if they occur after July 1, 2017, would result in an institution not qualifying as financially responsible or administratively capable. Those include, but are not limited to:

• | failure to satisfy the 90-10 Rule in any year;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | failure to timely file quarterly or annual financial statements with the SEC;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a warning from the SEC that it may suspend trading in our stock;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | notification by NASDAQ that our stock is not in compliance with its exchange requirements and/or may be delisted; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cohort default rates in excess of 30% for two consecutive years.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 Additionally, the 2016 regulations include a number of potential financial events that, if they occur on or after July 1, 2017, would cause ED to re-calculate an institution’s most recent financial responsibility composite score to determine whether the losses or potential losses from the event cause the composite score to fall below 1.0. The composite score is one measure ED uses to evaluate an institution’s financial responsibility using annual financial statements. Triggering events arising on or after July 1, 2017 that can lead to the recalculation of a composite score include, but are not limited to:
 
 
• | incurring a debt or liability arising from a final judgment in a judicial or administrative proceeding or settlement;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | being sued in an action by a federal or state authority for financial relief that is based on claims related to the making of federal loans or the provision of educational services and the suit has been pending for 120 days;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | being sued in any other lawsuit not referenced above that survives certain procedural steps such as the denial of an institution’s motion for summary judgment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the institution submitting a teach-out plan to its accreditor, including voluntarily teaching-out a location; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | programs failing to meet gainful employment regulations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 
         ED also adopted a number of discretionary triggering events that, if they occur on or after July 1, 2017, it may consider in assessing whether an institution is financially responsible. They include, but are not limited to:
  
• | significant fluctuations in Title IV aid between award years;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | citation from a state licensing or authorizing agency of failing to meet state or agency requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | failure of a to-be-developed financial stress test ED may develop;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an institution has high annual drop-out rates;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | an institution is placed on show-cause, probation or similar adverse action threatening an institution’s accreditation for failure to meet an accreditation standard;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | violation of a provision or requirement in a loan agreement; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | pending claims for borrower relief.
--+------------------------------------

 All of these triggers introduce considerable uncertainty and provide ED broad discretion regarding periodic determinations of our financial responsibility and associated enhanced financial protection it determines is required. 
 20

If any of the triggering events materialize, our institutions may be required to post a letter of credit equal to 10% or more of the institution’s previous year’s annual Title IV disbursements and to provide warnings to prospective and current students that the institution has been required to provide enhanced financial protection to ED.
 Additional Disclosures. The 2016 regulations establish a new student loan repayment rate measure only for for-profit institutions that assesses the rate at which student loan borrowers are repaying the principal balance of their federal student loans in the years immediately after leaving the institution. Those institutions for which the median borrower has not paid down any principal are required to provide prospective and current students with a disclosure that notes a majority of recent student loan borrowers that attended the institution are not paying down their loans. We will need to rely upon ED for the repayment rates. According to data previously provided by ED, the repayment rates for each of CTU and AIU would trigger the required warning to students. The disclosure is required to be broadly disseminated and included prominently in all advertising materials. ED’s promotion and endorsement of income based repayment options for students has adversely impacted the rate that student borrowers pay off their loans, particularly during the earlier period where students may be earning lower entry level wages, which may impact compliance with this new measure.
 Arbitration Agreements. The 2016 regulations prohibit an institution participating in Title IV Programs from incorporating any class action waiver provisions, or any arbitration clauses, in any agreements with students. If an institution’s contracts currently contain a pre-dispute arbitration provision or a class waiver, the institution will be required to amend the agreement or provide a specific notice to students, using language provided by ED that explains that those provisions have been changed, in order to continue its participation in Title IV Programs. This requirement applies to any existing agreements at the time the rule becomes effective, not just for those agreements entered into after July 1, 2017.
 2018 Proposed Regulations – Summary
The proposed regulations that were published on July 31, 2018 for public comment with respect to “borrower defense to repayment” sought input on a variety of proposed modifications to the 2016 regulations. These proposed regulations if published in final form by November 1, 2019, would generally apply for loans first made after July 1, 2020. Several of the key differences are described below. 
 Loan Discharge. The 2018 proposed borrower defense to repayment regulations would significantly alter how loan discharge applications would be treated by ED in the future. In addition to raising the burden of proof to a “preponderance of the evidence” standard, the 2018 proposed rules eliminated the three broad categories of evidence a student could use in a borrower defense proceeding and replaced it with a single new federal standard for a misrepresentation claim a student could assert against its school. Under the proposed standard, an individual borrower could assert a defense to repayment based on the institution’s statement, act, or omission that is false, misleading, or deceptive. To be eligible for relief, the borrower would be required to demonstrate that the misrepresentation (1) was made with knowledge of its false, misleading, or deceptive nature or with a reckless disregard for the truth, (2) was relied upon by the borrower in making an enrollment decision, and (3) caused the student financial harm.
 In addition, the 2018 proposed regulations would eliminate the concept of automatic group loan discharges and would require individual claims to be made by students and include a process for the institution to provide a defense to any claims asserted. In the public comment notice, ED specifically asked for public feedback on whether students should be permitted to affirmatively apply for loan discharge or whether they should only be permitted to raise a misrepresentation claim as a defense to a collections proceeding on their student loans.    
 Financial Responsibility. The 2018 proposed regulations would keep significant modifications to the existing rules governing an institution’s required financial responsibility and administrative capability by maintaining a number of triggering events that, if they occur after effective date of the rule, would result in an institution not qualifying as financially responsible or administratively capable. The 2018 proposed regulations would narrow the list of the mandatory and discretionary triggers making them a more objective set of measures. They include:

• | a warning from the SEC that it may suspend trading in our stock; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | notification by NASDAQ that our stock is not in compliance with its exchange requirements and/or may be delisted.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additionally, the 2018 proposed regulation include more definitive financial events that, if they occur on or after the effective date of the rule, would cause ED to re-calculate an institution’s most recent financial responsibility composite score to determine whether the losses or reduction in owner’s equity from the event cause the composite score to fall below 1.0. The composite score is one measure ED uses to evaluate an institution’s financial responsibility using annual financial statements. Triggering events arising on or after July 1, 2017 that can lead to the recalculation of a composite score include, but are not limited to:
 
 
• | incurring a debt or liability arising from a final judgment in a judicial or administrative proceeding or settlement including loan discharge proceedings; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if our composite score is below 1.5 and we withdraw owner’s equity.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 
21

         The 2018 proposed regulations also keep select discretionary triggering events that, if they occur on or after the effective date of the regulation, allow ED to designate an institution as not financially responsible. They include, but are not limited to:
  
• | failure to satisfy the 90-10 Rule in any year;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | cohort default rates in excess of 30% for two consecutive years;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | citation from a state licensing or authorizing agency of failing to meet state or agency requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an institution is placed on show-cause, probation or similar adverse action threatening an institution’s accreditation for failure to meet an accreditation standard; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | violation of a provision or requirement in a loan agreement.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 The trigger events in the 2018 proposed regulations are significantly less subjective than a number of the eliminated triggering events that were included in the 2016 regulations. If any of the triggering events materialize, our institutions may be required to post a letter of credit equal to 10% or more of the institution’s previous year’s annual Title IV disbursements.
 Additional Repayment Rate Disclosure Eliminated. The 2018 proposed regulations eliminated the separate repayment rate disclosure obligation from the 2016 regulations that applied only to for-profit institutions. ED has indicated it favors a more universally applicable set of disclosures it is working to incorporate into its college scorecards.  
 Arbitration Agreements. The 2018 proposed regulations eliminate the prohibition on class action waiver provisions and arbitration clauses in agreements with students that was included in the 2016 regulations and instead requires plain language disclosures of internal grievance procedures and alternative dispute resolution processes. 
 Unless the 2016 borrower defense to repayment regulations are modified, we expect to experience additional administrative burdens associated with monitoring, reporting and disclosure obligations as well as responding to future claims for loan discharge. We expect the absence of arbitration agreements will make dispute resolution more difficult and more expensive. We are uncertain what impact the 2016 regulations or any new or modified regulations will have on student enrollments, the volume of claims for loan discharge we may receive or our future financial responsibility as determined by ED. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate - Currently effective or modified “borrower defense to repayment” regulations may subject us to significant repayment liability to ED for discharged federal student loans, posting of substantial letters of credit and other requirements that could have a material adverse effect on us,” for more information about risks associated with the borrower defense to repayment regulations.
 
Financial Responsibility Standards
 To participate in Title IV Programs, our institutions must either satisfy standards of financial responsibility prescribed by ED, or post a letter of credit in favor of ED and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV Programs. Pursuant to the Title IV Program regulations, each eligible higher education institution must, among other things, satisfy a quantitative standard of financial responsibility that is based on a weighted average of three annual tests which assess the financial condition of the institution. The three tests measure primary reserve, equity and net income ratios. The Primary Reserve Ratio is a measure of an institution’s financial viability and liquidity. The Equity Ratio is a measure of an institution’s capital resources and its ability to borrow. The Net Income Ratio is a measure of an institution’s profitability. These tests provide three individual scores that are converted into a single composite score. The maximum composite score is 3.0. If the institution achieves a composite score of at least 1.5, it is considered financially responsible without conditions or additional oversight. A composite score from 1.0 to 1.4 is considered to be in “the zone” of financial responsibility, and a composite score of less than 1.0 is not considered to be financially responsible. If an institution is in “the zone” of financial responsibility, the institution may establish eligibility to continue to participate in Title IV Programs on the following alternative bases: 
 •
Zone Alternative. Under what is referred to as the “zone alternative,” an institution may continue to participate in Title IV Programs for up to three years under additional monitoring and reporting procedures but without having to post a letter of credit in favor of ED. These additional monitoring and reporting procedures include being transferred from the “advance” method of payment of Title IV Program funds to cash monitoring status (referred to as Heightened Cash Monitoring 1, or “HCM1”, status) or to the “reimbursement” or Heightened Cash Monitoring 2 (“HCM2”) methods of payment. If an institution does not achieve a composite score of at least 1.0 in one of the three subsequent years or does not improve its financial condition to attain a composite score of at least 1.5 by the end of the three-year period, the institution must satisfy another alternative standard to continue participating in Title IV Programs.
 •
Letter of Credit Alternative. An institution that fails to meet one of the standards of financial responsibility, including by having a composite score less than 1.5, may demonstrate financial responsibility by submitting an irrevocable letter of credit to ED in an amount equal to at least 50% of the Title IV Program funds that the institution received during its most recently completed fiscal year.
 •
Provisional Certification. If an institution fails to meet one of the standards of financial responsibility, including by having a composite score less than 1.5, ED may permit the institution to participate under provisional certification for up to three years. If ED 
 22

permits an institution to participate under provisional certification, an institution must comply with the requirements of the “zone alternative,” including being transferred to the HCM1, HCM2 or “reimbursement” method of payment of Title IV Program funds, and must submit a letter of credit to ED in an amount determined by ED which can range from 10%-100% of the Title IV Program funds that the institution received during its most recently completed fiscal year. If an institution is still not financially responsible at the end of the period of provisional certification, including because it has a composite score of less than 1.0, ED may again permit provisional certification subject to the terms ED determines appropriate.
 ED applies its quantitative financial responsibility tests annually based on an institution’s audited financial statements and may apply the tests if an institution undergoes a change in control or under other circumstances. ED also may apply the tests to the parent company of our institutions, and to other related entities. Our composite score for the consolidated entity for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 3.0, and our preliminary calculation for the year ended December 31, 2018 is 3.0, which are considered financially responsible without conditions or additional oversight. If in the future we are required to satisfy ED’s standards of financial responsibility on an alternative basis, including potentially by posting irrevocable letters of credit, we may not have the capacity to post these letters of credit.
 Accreditor and state regulatory requirements also address financial responsibility, and these requirements vary among agencies and also are different from the ED requirements. Any developments relating to our satisfaction of ED’s financial responsibility requirements may lead to additional focus or review by our accreditors or applicable state agencies regarding their respective financial responsibility requirements.
 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate – A failure to demonstrate ‘financial responsibility’ or ‘administrative capability’ would have negative impacts on our operations,” for additional information regarding risks relating to the financial responsibility standards.
 Return and Refunds of Title IV Program Funds
 An institution participating in Title IV Programs must correctly calculate the amount of unearned Title IV Program funds that were disbursed to students who withdrew from educational programs before completing the programs, and must return those funds in a timely manner.
 The portion of tuition and fee payments billed to students but not yet earned is recorded as deferred tuition revenue and reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets, as such amounts represent revenue that we expect to earn within the next year. If a student withdraws from one of our institutions prior to the completion of the academic term, we refund the portion of tuition and fees already paid that we are not entitled to retain, pursuant to applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards and our refund policy. The amount of funds to be refunded on behalf of a student is calculated based upon the period of time in which the student has attended classes and the amount of tuition and fees paid by the student as of the student’s withdrawal date. Such refunds typically result in a reduction to deferred tuition revenue and cash on our consolidated balance sheets, because generally, we do not recognize tuition revenue in our consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) until related refund provisions have lapsed.
 Institutions are required to return any unearned Title IV funds within 45 days of the date the institution determines that the student has withdrawn. An institution that is found to be in non-compliance with ED refund requirements for either of the last two completed fiscal years must post a letter of credit in favor of ED in an amount equal to 25% of the total Title IV Program returns that were paid or should have been paid by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year. As of December 31, 2018, we have posted no letters of credit in favor of ED due to non-compliance with ED refund requirements.
 Change of Ownership or Control
 When an institution undergoes a change of ownership resulting in a change of control, as that term is defined by the state in which it is located, its accrediting agency and ED, it must secure the approval of those agencies to continue to operate and to continue to participate in Title IV Programs. If the institution is unable to re-establish state authorization and accreditation requirements and satisfy other requirements for certification by ED, the institution may lose its authority to operate and its ability to participate in Title IV Programs. An institution whose change of ownership or control is approved by the appropriate authorities is nonetheless provisionally re-certified by ED for a period of up to three years. Transactions or events that constitute a change of control by one or more of the applicable regulatory agencies, including ED, applicable state agencies, and accrediting bodies, include the acquisition of an institution from another entity or significant acquisition or disposition of an institution’s equity. It is possible that some of these events may occur without our control. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in obtaining, a required approval of any change in control from ED, applicable state agencies, or accrediting agencies could impair our ability or the ability of the affected institutions to participate in Title IV Programs. If we were to undergo a change of control and a material number of our institutions failed to obtain the required approvals from applicable regulatory agencies in a timely manner, our student population, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
 When we acquire an institution that is eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, that institution undergoes a change of ownership resulting in a change of control as defined by ED. Each of our acquired institutions has undergone a certification review 
 23

under our ownership and has been certified to participate in Title IV Programs on a provisional basis, per ED requirements, until such time that ED signs a new program participation agreement with the institution. Currently, neither of our institutions are subject to provisional certification status due to ED’s change of ownership criteria. The potential adverse effects of a change of control under ED regulations may influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance or redemption of our common stock.
 Opening New Institutions, Start-up Campuses and Adding Educational Programs
 The Higher Education Act generally requires that for-profit institutions be fully operational for two years before applying to participate in Title IV Programs. However, an institution that is certified to participate in Title IV Programs may establish a start-up branch campus or location and participate in Title IV Programs at the start-up campus without reference to the two-year requirement if the start-up campus has received all of the necessary state and accrediting agency approvals, has been reported to ED, and meets certain other criteria as defined by ED. Nevertheless, under certain circumstances, a start-up branch campus may also be required to obtain approval from ED to be able to participate in Title IV Programs.
 In addition to ED regulations, certain of the state and accrediting agencies with jurisdiction over our institutions have requirements that may affect our ability to open a new institution, open a start-up branch campus or location of one of our existing institutions, or begin offering a new educational program at one of our institutions. If we establish a new institution, add a new branch start-up campus, or expand program offerings at any of our institutions without obtaining the required approvals, we would likely be liable for repayment of Title IV Program funds provided to students at that institution or branch campus or enrolled in that educational program, and we could also be subject to sanctions. Also, if we are unable to obtain the approvals from ED, applicable state regulatory agencies, and accrediting agencies for any new institutions, branch campuses, or program offerings where such approvals are required, or to obtain such approvals in a timely manner, our ability to grow our business would be impaired and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
 Administrative Capability
 ED regulations specify extensive criteria that an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in Title IV Programs. These criteria relate to, among other things, institutional staffing, operational standards such as procedures for disbursing and safeguarding Title IV Program funds, timely submission of accurate reports to ED and various other procedural matters. If an institution fails to satisfy any of ED’s criteria for administrative capability, ED may require the repayment of Title IV Program funds disbursed by the institution, place the institution on provisional certification status, require the institution to receive Title IV Program funds under another funding arrangement, impose fines or limit or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV Programs.
Restrictions on Payment of Commissions, Bonuses and Other Incentive Payments
 An institution participating in Title IV Programs cannot provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or Title IV financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance. Regulations issued in October 2010 which became effective July 1, 2011 rescinded previously issued ED guidance and “safe harbors” relied upon by higher education institutions in making decisions how they managed, compensated and promoted individuals engaged in student recruiting and the awarding of financial aid and their supervisors. The elimination of these “safe harbor” protections and guidance required us to terminate certain compensation payments to our affected employees and to implement changes in contractual and other arrangements with third parties to change structures formerly allowed under ED rules, and has had an impact on our ability to compensate, recruit, retain and motivate affected admissions and other affected employees as well as on our business arrangements with third-party lead generators and other marketing vendors. In September 2016, ED’s Office of Inspector General released a revised audit guide applicable specifically to for-profit schools that requires an annual audit to review compliance with the incentive compensation restrictions.
 Further, ED provided very limited published guidance regarding this rule and does not establish clear criteria for compliance for many circumstances. If ED determined that an institution’s compensation practices violated these standards, ED could subject the institution to monetary fines, penalties or other sanctions.
 Substantial Misrepresentation
 The Higher Education Act prohibits an institution participating in Title IV Programs from engaging in substantial misrepresentation of the nature of its educational programs, financial charges, graduate employability or its relationship with ED. Under ED’s rules, a "misrepresentation" is any statement (made in writing, visually, orally or otherwise) made by the institution, any of its representatives or a third party that provides educational programs, marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services to the institution, that is false, erroneous or has the likelihood or tendency to deceive, and a "substantial misrepresentation" is any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person’s detriment. Considering the broad definition of “substantial misrepresentation,” it is possible that, despite our training efforts 
 24

and compliance programs, our institutions' employees or service providers may make statements that could be construed as substantial misrepresentations. In addition, ED’s gainful employment regulation requires the disclosure of select student outcome metrics and includes disclosure of a number of new metrics on institutional websites and during enrollment to all new students. Errors or omissions in these metrics may be used by ED as the basis for a finding of “substantial misrepresentation.” If ED determines that one of our institutions has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, ED may revoke the institution’s program participation agreement, deny applications from the institution for approval of new programs or locations or other matters, or initiate proceedings under its borrower defense to repayment regulations to fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs; the institution could also be exposed to increased risk of action under the Federal False Claims Act.
