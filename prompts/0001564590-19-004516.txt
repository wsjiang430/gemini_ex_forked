Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of orally administered small molecule drug candidates to fill significant unmet medical needs. We have a powerful pipeline of clinical drug candidates, led by our programs for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (“AD”) and diabetes. Our drug candidate for the treatment of AD, azeliragon (TTP488), is an orally administered, small molecule antagonist targeting the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (“RAGE”).  We have initiated start-up activities for an adaptive Phase 2/3 trial to evaluate azeliragon as a potential treatment of mild-AD in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our type 2 diabetes drug candidates are TTP399, an orally administered, liver-selective glucokinase activator (“GKA”), which successfully completed a Phase 2b clinical trial in type 2 diabetes (the “AGATA Study”), and TTP273, an orally administered, non-peptide agonist that targets the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (“GLP-1r”), which successfully completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in type 2 diabetes (the “LOGRA Study”). We are currently investigating TTP399 as a treatment for type 1 diabetes in an adaptive Phase 2 study in partnership with JDRF International (“JDRF”).  In addition, we are furthering the development of our peroxisome proliferation activated receptor delta (“PPAR-δ”) agonist and phosphodiesterase type 4 (“PDE4”) programs through partnerships with pharmaceutical partners via licensing arrangements.  Finally, we continue to advance our NRF2 pathway program via research agreements with academic and industry collaborators.

 The following table summarizes our current leading drug candidates and their respective stages of development:
 
Our Strategy
 Our goal is to leverage our powerful pipeline of orally administered, small molecule drug candidates to deliver novel, differentiated therapies to fill significant unmet medical needs. As key components of our strategy, we:

• | Initiated start-up activities for an adaptive Phase 2/3 clinical trial for azeliragon as a potential treatment of mild Alzheimer’s disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. Subsequent post-hoc subgroup analyses of our phase 3 STEADFAST Study identified a population that experienced positive benefit. Based on these results, we have initiated start-up activities for an adaptive Phase 2/3 trial to evaluate azeliragon as a potential treatment of mild-AD in patients with type 2 diabetes. We are currently finalizing a protocol for the study, negotiating with clinical research organizations to support study conduct activities for the trial and beginning the site selection process. We expect to initiate patient enrollment in this study in mid-2019. We plan to continue to develop azeliragon, through internal efforts, with additional funding, or through partnerships with other life science entities.

 Our Alzheimer’s Program – Azeliragon
 Alzheimer’s Disease and the Role of RAGE in its Onset
 AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually the ability to carry out simple tasks. Its symptoms include cognitive dysfunction, memory abnormalities, progressive impairment in activities of daily living and a host of behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The exact cause of AD is unknown; however, genetic and environmental factors are established contributors. Amyloid Beta (“Aβ”) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein, and neuroinflammation in the brain are believed to be the main causes of the disease, leading to loss of neuronal connectivity in the brain.
 RAGE is an immunoglobulin-like cell surface receptor that is overexpressed in brain tissues of patients with AD. We believe that RAGE is an important cellular cofactor that binds ligands that are implicated in multiple factors of AD, including Aβ transport into the brain, the phosphorylation of tau, chronic inflammation, vascular dysfunction, metabolic dysregulation and neurotoxicity. These effects are attenuated following antagonism of the RAGE receptor.
 Post-mortem studies in AD patients reveal increased RAGE expression in neuronal, microglial and endothelial cells when compared to similar subjects without AD. Cells around senile plaques express higher levels of RAGE during disease progression. Furthermore, expressed levels of RAGE are correlated with the severity of the disease. The data observed in human AD patients is consistent with the multiple non-clinical in-vitro and in-vivo models studied by third parties that show RAGE is overexpressed in brain tissue. Taken together, we believe that the scientific literature provides substantial support for RAGE inhibition as a validated and promising therapeutic approach in the treatment of AD.

5

Advanced glycation endproducts (“AGEs”) also accumulate in tissues of people with type 2 diabetes. When the concentration of RAGE ligands (e.g., AGEs) increases, more RAGE expression is induced.   AGEs play a major role in the worsening of complications of type 2 diabetes, such as retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy. Furthermore, AGE accumulation parallels the development of cognitive impairment and dementia in individuals with type 2 diabetes.
 Current Treatments of Alzheimer’s Disease and Their Limitations
 Currently, there are only two classes of approved therapies for the treatment of AD: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (“AChEIs”) and glutamatergic modulators. AChEIs are designed to slow the degradation of acetylcholine, helping to preserve neuronal communication and function temporarily, but do not slow or halt neuronal death. Glutamatergic modulators are designed to block sustained, low-level activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (“NMDA”) receptor without inhibiting the normal function of the receptor in memory and cognition, providing temporary symptomatic relief.
 The currently available treatments combat the symptoms of AD rather than the underlying cause and as a result, AD continues to progress in these patients despite treatment. Similarly, the use of antidepressants and antipsychotics are often prescribed off-label to treat the symptoms of severe AD when patients suffer from agitation, aggressive behaviors, psychosis and depression. Recent drug candidates under development include those focused on Aβ synthesis or clearance from the brain, the phosphorylation of tau protein, chronic inflammation, vascular dysfunction, metabolic dysregulation and neurotoxicity.
 
Our Solution: Azeliragon
 Azeliragon is an orally administered, small molecule investigational drug candidate with a novel mechanism of action of inhibiting RAGE.  Azeliragon has the potential to offer a novel modality in AD therapeutics, and we are not aware of any other clinical-stage drugs targeting RAGE. Because currently approved treatments are focused on symptom relief, we believe that azeliragon represents a potential new approach for the treatment of AD. In addition, we believe that in order to successfully treat and combat the physiological progression of AD, an effective treatment must act on multiple causes of the disease. Azeliragon is designed to inhibit RAGE, which affects the multiple factors of AD, including Aβ transport into the brain, the phosphorylation of tau, chronic inflammation, vascular dysfunction, metabolic dysregulation and neurotoxicity.  To date, we have conducted eight Phase 1, three Phase 2 and two Phase 3 clinical trials of azeliragon.  Both Parts A and B of our Phase 3 STEADFAST Study of azeliragon in people with mild Alzheimer’s disease failed to meet either of the co-primary efficacy endpoints.
 Phase 3 STEADFAST Study
 We initiated the STEADFAST Study in April 2015 pursuant to a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) with the FDA. The study was conducted in the United States and certain English-speaking foreign countries under a single protocol and was designed to enroll 800 mild AD patients in total, divided equally across two independent 400-patient sub-studies, in which each subject received either a 5 mg/day dose of azeliragon or placebo, randomized on a one-to-one basis, added to the standard of care. Though we announced in 2018 that neither the A-Study nor the B-Study met its clinical endpoints, a post-hoc subgroup analysis of 24 patients from the A-Study of the STEADFAST Study with type 2 diabetes (defined by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of greater than or equal to 6.5% at baseline; HbA1c greater than 7.7% was an exclusion criterion at screening) and a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease showed benefit to azeliragon. The azeliragon-trea
ted group in the A-Study (n=17) demonstrated a 6.1 point benefit on ADAS-cog relative to the placebo group (n=7), which was nominally statistically significant (p = 0.018) after 18 months of treatment.  The azeliragon-treated group in the A-Study (n=17) demonstrated a 1.7 point benefit on CDR-sb relative to the placebo group (n=7) (p=.05) after 18 months of treatment.  
 6

Based on these results, we have initiated start up activities for an adaptive Phase 2/3 trial to evaluate azeliragon as a potential treatment of mild-AD in patients with type 2 diabetes.  We are currently finalizing a protocol for the study, negotiating with clinical research organizations to support study conduct activities for the trial and beginning the site selection process.  We expect to initiate patient enrollment in this study in mid-2019.
 Azeliragon was previously awarded Fast Track designation by the FDA and, relying upon the program’s Fast Track Designation status, we have pursued discussions with the FDA and EMA to propose a pathway for further clinical development in support of regulatory approval of azeliragon.  In July 2018, we submitted a full briefing book to the FDA in support of our request for a Type C meeting seeking development guidance for azeliragon. In September 2018, we received a written response from the FDA to our Type C meeting request.  In the response, the FDA advised that the efficacy of azeliragon should be demonstrated in at least two adequate and well-controlled trials, unless under the exceptional circumstances in which a single trial might suffice as set forth in the FDA’s guidance document entitled “Providing Clinical Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products”.  We met with the Scientific Advice Working Party (“SAWP”) of the EMA in October 2018, to discuss future development requirements in support of approval of azeliragon in the European Union.   In response, the SAWP advised on the circumstances in which a single trial might suffice.   For a single pivotal trial to be acceptable, the results would need to be particularly compelling with respect to internal and external validity, clinical relevance, statistical significance, data quality and internal consistency. The SAWP acknowledged preliminary data concerning overexpression of RAGE in the A- and B-studies and subgroups analyses, based on patients with evidence of high circulating levels of RAGE ligands such as HbA1c and Amyloid beta, provide support for the hypothesis that patients with increased concentrations of RAGE ligands have beneficial effects of azeliragon.  
 Adverse Events (Phase 3 Mild AD Patients)
 Among the most frequent adverse events (“AEs”) occurring in >2% of subjects who received the 5 mg/day of azeliragon in Phase 3 were urinary tract infection (“UTI”) (10.2%), depression (4.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (4.5%), dizziness (4.1%), weight decreased (3.9%), nausea (3.2%), cough (2.9%), insomnia (2.5%), syncope (2.5%) constipation (2.3%) and musculoskeletal pain (2.3%).   A comparison to placebo subjects is provided in the table below:

Our Diabetes Programs – Glucokinase Activator and GLP-1r Agonist
 Diabetes Overview
 A person suffering from diabetes does not produce or properly use insulin (a hormone that enables people to get energy from food). 
 In type 2 diabetes, the secretion of insulin from the pancreas and the action of insulin on tissues such as fat and muscle are both abnormal. Type 2 diabetics produce insulin, but insulin production and use both decrease over time as the disease progresses, ultimately requiring insulin administration to manage the disease. Obesity is generally considered the major contributor to the development of type 2 diabetes. As the global obesity epidemic expands, the increase in the number of type 2 diabetes patients has and is expected to continue. With the increasing incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes, we believe there is a significant unmet medical need for treatment alternatives with improved efficacy and safety.
 Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which a person’s pancreas stops producing insulin. Type 1 diabetes results when the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas called beta cells. While its causes are not yet entirely understood, scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental triggers are involved. The onset of type 1 diabetes is not believed to be affected by diet or lifestyle. 
 Current Treatments for Diabetes and Their Limitations
 Diabetic patients have difficulty achieving and maintaining consistent glycemic control, defined as HbA1c < 7% as recommended by the American Diabetes Association. Failure to attain or maintain glycemic control over time raises a patient’s risk of disease progression with the attendant loss of control and progression to potentially serious complications, such as cardiovascular disease, blindness, kidney failure, and nerve damage.
 The current treatment paradigm for type 2 diabetes focuses on lifestyle changes, including weight loss, if applicable, as well as medications to manage blood glucose levels. Obesity is generally considered the major contributor to the development of type 2 diabetes, and weight loss alone is associated with improvements in glycemic parameters. Optimal glycemic control is the treatment goal in diabetic patients to prevent the risk of long-term microvascular complications. There are currently several classes of drugs approved to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, including injectable drugs and oral anti-diabetic drugs (“OADs”). Existing injectable therapies for type 2 diabetes include most forms of insulin therapy and GLP-1r agonists. Existing OADs include metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones, with the addition of two new classes in the past few years, DPP-4 and SGLT-2 inhibitors, driving the OAD market’s growth. We believe the continued and significant unmet medical need for diabetes treatments is demonstrated by the continued to development of new potential therapies such as Novo Nordisk A/S’s oral semaglutide and Lexicon’s SGLT-1/SGLT-2 inhibitor.
 While multiple oral drugs are approved for the management of high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) in type 2 diabetes, insulin injection is the only treatment option approved in the United States for type 1 diabetes. There is an unmet medical need to provide people with type 1 diabetes additional treatment options that can help them to achieve tighter blood glucose levels and reduce insulin doses without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia (blood glucose levels below normal) or ketoacidosis.
 We expect our diabetes investigational drug candidates, if approved, to compete in the non-insulin therapy market, currently comprised of OADs and injectable GLP-1r agonists. OADs are the preferred first line treatment by physicians (primary care and endocrinologists), payors and patients given their ease of use, cost, convenience and no training requirements. For patients with type 2 diabetes, the goal of these therapies is to delay the progression to insulin dependence. Despite the availability of multiple oral therapies and the introduction of new oral therapies (DPP-4 and SGLT-2 inhibitors) with novel mechanisms for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, which are used both as monotherapy and in combination with other agents, there remains a lack of differentiation and inadequate efficacy. While injectable GLP-1r agonists are generally considered to have superior efficacy compared with approved OADs, primary care physicians and patients continue to prefer oral agents for their ease of use and improved patient compliance versus injectables.

There remains an unmet medical need for an oral drug that mimics the superiority of GLP-1r agonists and reduces the incidence of hypoglycemia. 
 Our Solutions: Glucokinase Activator and GLP-1r Agonist
 
With the increasing incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes, we believe there is a significant unmet medical need for treatment alternatives with improved efficacy, safety, and convenience. We have chosen two different approaches for the treatment of diabetes: activation of glucokinase (GK), through our drug candidate TTP399, and stimulation of GLP-1r, through our drug candidate TTP273. If approved, we believe TTP399 and TTP273 could offer attractive alternatives as OADs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.  In addition, there is a significant unmet medical need for treatments of type 1 diabetes with agents other than insulin injection.  TTP399 could also fill this unmet need by reducing the extent of reliance on insulin.
 Glucokinase Activator
 The Role of GK Activation in Diabetes
 GK acts as the physiological glucose sensor, changing its conformation, activity and/or intracellular location in parallel with changes in glucose concentrations. GK has two main distinctive characteristics that make it a good choice for blood glucose control. First, its expression is mostly limited to tissues that require glucose-sensing (mainly liver and pancreatic β-cells). Second, GK is able to sense changes in serum glucose levels and modulate changes in liver glucose metabolism that in turn regulate the balance between hepatic glucose production and glucose consumption, and modulate changes in insulin secretion by the β-cells.
 Studies in humans, along with numerous animal studies, showing that mutations in the gene encoding GK can cause both hyperglycemia (diabetes mellitus) and hypoglycemia (glucose levels below normal) depending on the mutation, confirm the critical role of GK in the regulation of glucose control. The concept of GK activation for the treatment of diabetes is attractive because it has proven to be effective and safe in normalizing glycemia in animal models of type 2 diabetes by a mechanism entirely distinct from the action of antidiabetic therapies currently on the market. Moreover, several lines of evidence have suggested that development of type 2 diabetes is related to functional impairment of the GK enzyme. Thus, GK activation may be a way to overcome an important underlying cause of type 2 diabetes progression and hence halt or delay the course of the disease.
 Many competitors have tried to develop drugs that act as GKAs. Previously identified GKAs evaluated in the clinic for the treatment of type 2 diabetes demonstrate improved glucose control; however, these GKAs showed increased incidence of hypoglycemia and hyperlipidemia and an apparent lack of durability of efficacy. These liabilities have been correlated to hyperstimulation of the β-cells in a glucose independent manner and/or the accumulation of lipids in the liver, consistent with the disruption of GK and the glucokinase regulatory protein (“GKRP”) interaction by these GKAs. Thus, liver-selective compounds that do not activate GK in pancreatic β-cells or affect the GK-GKRP interaction in the liver are expected to demonstrate a superior profile in comparison to previously identified GKAs. 
 GK activation is also attractive as a potential therapy for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, with a mechanism of action entirely distinct from currently marketed OADs.  GK activation has been demonstrated in animal models of type 1 diabetes to reduce HbA1c and to be well tolerated.
 TTP399
 TTP399 is an orally administered, small molecule, liver-selective GKA in development as a new potential OAD for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes with a novel mechanism of action: liver-selective activation of GK that seeks to provide intensive glycemic control without inducing significant hypoglycemia. If approved for type 2 diabetes, we believe TTP399 would compete primarily with other OADs, including DPP-4 and SGLT-2 inhibitors. Our trials for TTP399 suggest that our approach to GK activation has the potential to avoid the tolerability issues associated with other GKAs, such as activation of GK in the pancreas, stimulation of insulin secretion independent of glucose, hypoglycemia, increased lipids and liver toxicity. Further, we believe that TTP399, if approved, has the potential to normalize HbA1c levels without having contraindication for renal impairment and with little risk of pancreatitis. Based on data from Phase 1 and 2 trials to date, we believe that TTP399, if approved, has the potential to be a first-in-class OAD due to its liver-selectivity and novel mechanism of action.  We have completed nine Phase 1 and two Phase 2 clinical trials of TTP399. In our Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, TTP399 was well tolerated with negligible incidence of hypoglycemia.
 Ongoing Phase 2 simplici-T1 Study
 In November 2017, we initiated the simplici-T1 Study, an adaptive Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of TTP399, assessing the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of TTP399 in adult patients with type 1 diabetes (“T1D”).  The study is designed to evaluate whether TTP399 is well tolerated when administered as an add-on to insulin therapy and can improve daily glucose 
 9

profiles and HbA1c in people living with T1D.  We have completed enrollment of the part 1 learning phase and expect to report results for this portion of the study in June 2019.  We have begun the start-up activities for the part 2 confirming phase and expect to report results for this portion of the study in the latter part of the first quarter of 2020.  The study is being conducted in partnership with JDRF.
 Completed Phase 2b AGATA Study
 In August 2016, we completed a Phase 2b clinical trial of TTP399, the AGATA Study, which was a six-month trial to demonstrate proof-of-concept that the benefits from TTP399 could be sustained over time. The AGATA Study was a multi-center adaptive Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active- (sitagliptin) controlled, parallel group trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TTP399 following six months of administration in 190 subjects with type 2 diabetes on a stable dose of metformin. Patients had a baseline HbA1c of 7.0 - 9.5%. The AGATA Study included subjects across four arms, including two doses of TTP399 (400 mg and 800 mg), sitagliptin, which is a DPP-4 inhibitor, and placebo.  
 The primary endpoint of the AGATA Study was the change from baseline in HbA1c at six months. A key secondary endpoint was change in weight.
 In the AGATA Study, TTP399 demonstrated achievement of the primary endpoint of statistically significant change from baseline in HbA1c at six months of daily administration of 800 mg of TTP399. The reduction in HbA1c was dose-dependent and sustained throughout the duration of the study. TTP399 was also found to be well-tolerated and no adverse events of severe hypoglycemia or hyperlipidemia were reported in the TTP399-treated group.  

In January 2019, a paper was published in Science Translational Medicine showcasing the discovery and development of TTP399.  It reviews the scientific rationale underpinning the development of TTP399 and its progression from preclinical to clinical development concluding with the positive results of the AGATA Study.
 We are continuing to explore options, including various fundraising strategies, for further development of TTP399 for type 2 diabetes and diabetic complications either alone or in collaboration with a partner.
 GLP-1r Agonist
 The Role of GLP-1r Activation in Diabetes
 GLP-1r is a class B, G protein-coupled receptor that regulates important physiological and pathological processes related to type 2 diabetes. GLP-1r stimulation as a therapeutic modality has been validated by the approval of peptide GLP-1r agonists, such as exendin-4 (Byetta) and liraglutide (Victoza). Subcutaneous administration of these peptides lowers blood glucose, decreases HbA1c levels and reduces weight.  However, the injectable method of administration has limited their use. This injectable class of peptides is also associated with gastrointestinal side effects (nausea and vomiting). Despite the clinical success observed with the injectable peptides, no orally available GLP-1r agonists have demonstrated similar efficacy in clinical trials to date.
 10

TTP273
 TTP273 is a potential first-in-class, orally administered, small molecule, non-peptide GLP-1r agonist. We believe an orally administered GLP-1r agonist that mimics the metabolic effects of GLP-1r peptides showing enhanced glycemic control, an improved lipid profile and weight loss, without causing the gastrointestinal side effects typical of this class of compounds, would offer a competitive advantage compared to GLP-1r targeted treatment options currently available. For these reasons, we believe TTP273 has the potential to expand the use of GLP-1r agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
 We have completed two Phase 1 clinical trials and one Phase 2 clinical trial of TTP273. Additionally, we have completed nine Phase 1 clinical trials and one Phase 2 clinical trial of TTP054, which was a predecessor orally administered GLP-1r agonist. In our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, TTP273 has been well tolerated with negligible incidences of nausea and vomiting. Based on the results of our completed Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of TTP273, we believe TTP273 to have the potential to provide both competitive efficacy and superior tolerability versus peptide GLP-1r analogues.
 
Completed Phase 2 LOGRA Study
 Our completed Phase 2 LOGRA study of TTP273 was a 12-week study conducted in 30 centers in the United States in 174 patients with type 2 diabetes on stable doses of metformin. In the LOGRA study, the patients were randomized to receive either placebo or TTP273 at doses of 150 mg once or twice daily.  Patients in the once and twice daily treatment arms had mean placebo-subtracted HbA1c differences of -0.86 percent and -0.71 percent, respectively. HbA1c increased by 0.15 percent in patients randomized to placebo. Although the study was not powered to demonstrate weight loss, trends were observed with patients losing on average 0.9 kg and 0.6 kg in the once and twice daily arms, respectively. An increase in weight of 0.05 kg was observed in the placebo group. TTP273 was well tolerated with no incidence of vomiting in the TTP273-treated groups and an incidence of nausea lower than that in the placebo group: 7.3% in the Placebo arm, 3.4% in QPM arm and 5.0% in the BID arm.
Huadong License Agreement
 Following the successful LOGRA Study of TTP273, on December 21, 2017, we entered into a License Agreement with Hangzhou Zhongmei Huadong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Huadong”) (the “Huadong License Agreement”), under which Huadong obtained a license to develop and commercialize the GLP-1r program in China and other Pacific Rim territories.  Refer to “Business – License and Research Agreements – Huadong License Agreement” for additional details.
 Additional Pipeline Opportunities
 We are also developing a portfolio of additional investigational drug candidates for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.  Such candidates include: (1) a novel PDE4 inhibitor (HPP737) with a low potential for emesis which may allow an expanded therapeutics scope than currently marketed products in Psoriasis and Atopic Dermatitis.  HPP737 has been licensed to Newsoara Biopharma Co., Ltd., (“Newsoara”) for development in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and other pacific rim countries.  Refer to “Business – License and Research Agreements – Newsoara License Agreement” for additional details; and (2) a BACH1/NRF2 modulator (HPP971), which we continue to develop via research collaborations.  These additional candidates have been through varying stages of preclinical and Phase 1 testing and we have submitted investigational new drug applications (“INDs”) for certain of them to the FDA.  
 11

While our primary focus is on the development of azeliragon, TTP399 and TTP273, we plan to continue to evaluate opportunities for furthering the development of these other compounds in our pipeline.  Such development may be done internally or through partnering relationships. 
 We entered into a License Agreement with Reneo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Reneo”), under which we granted Reneo an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to develop and commercialize our peroxisome proliferation activated receptor delta (PPAR-δ) agonist program, including the compound HPP593.  Refer to “Business – License and Research Agreements – Reneo License Agreement” for additional details.

 The IP portfolio for the GLP-1r program includes issued patents in over 35 countries and regions, including the U.S., Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and China, directed to TTP273 as a composition of matter.  The issued U.S. patent covering TTP273 as a composition of matter will expire no earlier than 2030, and may expire as late as 2035, if we obtain and apply the maximum possible extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act following approval.  Patents covering TTP273 as a composition of matter outside the United States will expire no earlier than 2030 and may expire much later as a result of patent term extensions based on patent office delays, regulatory delays, or a combination thereof.  The IP portfolio for TTP399 also includes patent families in multiple jurisdictions covering combinations of TTP273 and metformin, synthetic precursors to TTP273, and dosage regimens of TTP273.  These additional patent families have expiration dates ranging from 2032 through potentially 2039.
 Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed by employees or through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be 
 12

breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become publicly known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use or incorporate intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

Newsoara License Agreement
 On May 31, 2018, we entered into a license agreement with Newsoara (the “Newsoara License Agreement”), under which Newsoara obtained an exclusive and sublicensable license to develop and commercialize our phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitors (“PDE4”) program, including the compound HPP737, in China and other Pacific Rim countries (collectively, the “Newsoara License Territory”).  Additionally, under the Newsoara License Agreement, we obtained a non-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free license to develop and commercialize certain Newsoara patent rights and know-how related to our PDE4 program for therapeutic uses in humans outside of the Newsoara License Territory.  
 Under the terms of the Newsoara License Agreement, Newsoara paid us an upfront cash payment of $2.0 million. We are eligible to receive additional potential development, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments totaling up to $63.0 million.  In addition, Newsoara is obligated to pay us royalty payments at high-single to low-double digit rates, based on tiers of annual net sales of licensed products.  Such royalties will be payable on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the latest of expiration of the licensed patents covering a licensed product in a country, expiration of data exclusivity rights for a licensed product in a country or a specified number of years after the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a country.  
 Under the terms of the Newsoara License Agreement, Newsoara will be responsible for the development and commercialization of the licensed products in the Newsoara License Territory, at its cost, and is required to use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to such development and commercialization efforts.
 The Newsoara License Agreement, unless terminated earlier, will continue until expiration of all royalty obligations of Newsoara to us.  Either party may terminate the Newsoara License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach.  Newsoara may terminate the Newsoara License Agreement at will upon prior written notice.  Upon expiration (but not earlier termination) of the Newsoara License Agreement the licenses granted to Newsoara will survive on a royalty-free basis in perpetuity.
 JDRF Agreement
 In August 2017, we entered into a research, development and commercialization agreement with JDRF International (“JDRF”) (the “JDRF Agreement”) to support the funding of the simplici-T1 Study, an adaptive Phase 1b/2 study to explore the effects of TTP399, in type 1 diabetes.  We have completed enrollment of the part 1 learning phase and expect to report results for this portion of the study in June 2019.  We have begun the start-up activities for the part 2 confirming phase and expect to report results for this portion of the study in the latter part of the first quarter of 2020.  According to the terms of the JDRF Agreement, JDRF will provide research funding of up to $3.0 million based on the achievement of research and development milestones, with the total funding provided by JDRF not to exceed approximately one-half of the total cost of the project.  Additionally, we have the obligation to make certain milestone payments to JDRF upon the commercialization, licensing, sale or transfer of TTP399 as a treatment for type 1 diabetes.
 Novo Nordisk
 In February 2007, we entered into an Agreement Concerning Glucokinase Activator Project with Novo Nordisk A/S (the “Novo License Agreement”) whereby we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain Novo Nordisk intellectual property rights to discover, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use and commercialize products for the prevention, treatment, control, mitigation or palliation of human or animal diseases or conditions. As part of this license grant, we obtained certain worldwide rights to Novo Nordisk’s GKA program, including rights to preclinical and clinical compounds such as TTP399. Under the terms of the Novo License Agreement, we have additional potential developmental and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $115.0 million for approval of a product. We are also obligated for an additional $75.0 million in potential sales-based milestones, as well as royalty payments, at mid-single digit royalty rates, based on tiered sales of commercialized licensed products.
Columbia University
 In May 2015, we entered into a New Exclusive License Agreement (the “Columbia License Agreement”) with The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York (“Columbia”) whereby we obtained a worldwide, exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses under certain Columbia RAGE-related patent rights to discover, develop, manufacture, use, sell, have sold, import, have made, offer to sell, rent, or lease RAGE-inhibiting small molecules, including azeliragon. We also obtained a worldwide right to use certain RAGE-related research information and material. Under the terms of the Columbia License Agreement, we are required to pay an annual fee of $0.1 million, a potential milestone payment of $0.8 million and royalty payments at low-single digit royalty rates based on the net sales of licensed products.  We notified Columbia of our intent to terminate this agreement in December 2018.  
Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our drug candidates are efficacy, safety and 
 14

tolerability profile, mechanism of action, control and predictability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement, and availability of comparable alternative therapies.
 Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Potential Competing Products – Alzheimer’s Disease
 There are currently limited approved treatments for AD in the United States and existing therapies treat only the symptoms of the disease, rather than targeting the underlying mechanisms. The approved symptomatic AD therapies in the United States fall into two classes, AChEIs and glutamatergic modulators. If we are successful in our development of azeliragon as a treatment of probable Alzheimer’s dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes, it would be used as a treatment of this narrower patient group rather than as a treatment of AD in all patients.  Further, if it is approved, its mechanism of action may be complementary to existing standard of care, as well as that of drug candidates with differentiated mechanisms currently in development for AD, including anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies, BACE inhibitors, tau aggregation inhibitors and monoamine oxidase-b inhibitors. This will allow the opportunity for co-administration with these other drug candidates if they are successfully developed.  We are not aware of any other clinical-stage RAGE inhibitor investigational products being developed for the treatment of AD.
Potential Competing Products – Type 2 Diabetes
 If approved, we expect that our type 2 diabetes investigational drug candidates will compete with currently available non-insulin medication products for type 2 diabetes. These products include the following: 

• | Injectable GLP-1r agonists, such as exenatide or liraglutide, which mimic a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates the pancreas to secrete insulin when blood glucose levels are high.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | DPP-4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin or saxagliptin, are a class of drugs that work by blocking the enzyme that normally degrades GLP-1.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sulfonylureas and meglitinides, which are classes of drugs that act on the pancreatic cells to stimulate the secretion of insulin.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitizone, and biguanides, such as metformin, which lower blood glucose by improving the sensitivity of cells to insulin or diminishing insulin resistance.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, which lower the amount of glucose absorbed from the intestines, thereby reducing the rise in blood glucose that occurs after a meal.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SGLT-2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin and canagliflozin, are a class of medications that lower blood glucose by increasing glucose excretion in urine.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to existing marketed products, there are a number of product candidates currently in development focusing on the same mechanisms as our programs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, including: 
  
• | Glucokinase activators: Yabao Pharmaceutical Co, Inc., Pegbio Co. Ltd., Hua Medicine Ltd. and Teijin Pharma Limited are among the companies evaluating glucokinase activators in clinical or preclinical studies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Oral GLP-1r agonists: Diabetology Ltd., Heptares Therapeutics Ltd., Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, and Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc., are among the companies evaluating oral GLP-1r agonists in clinical or preclinical studies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In type 1 diabetes, oral non-insulin agents that are currently being developed that may compete with TTP399 include SGLT-1/2 inhibitors, such as sotagliflozin, being developed by Sanofi/Lexicon and SGLT-2 inhibitors such as AstraZeneca’s dapagliflozin and Eli Lilly/ Boehringer Ingelheim’s empagliflozin.
 We believe that our investigational drug candidates may offer key potential advantages over these competitive products that could enable our drug candidates, if approved, to capture meaningful market share from our competitors. Nevertheless, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug 
 15

candidate we may commercialize and may render our drug candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of their development and commercialization. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market, existing treatments come off patent, and more advanced technologies become available. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drug candidates non-competitive or obsolete.
 Collaboration Revenue and Customers
 The majority of our collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 is related to our licenses of certain compounds in the pre-clinical stage or clinical stage, including the Huadong License Agreement, the Reneo License Agreement, the Newsoara License Agreement and the Calithera License Agreement.  Revenue recognized in these periods relates to initial consideration received in the form of upfront payments and equity interests coupled with research activities performed by our personnel.  While we are continuing to seek partnership opportunities for our assets, we continue to focus on the development of azeliragon, TTP273 and TTP399 in the US.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approvals
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of biopharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 Approval and Regulation of Drugs in the United States
 In the United States, drug products are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and applicable implementing regulations and guidance. The failure of an applicant to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, including non-clinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process or post-approval process, may result in delays to the conduct of a study, regulatory review and approval and/or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions may include, but are not limited to, the FDA’s refusal to allow an applicant to proceed with clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, adverse publicity, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines and civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA or Department of Justice (“DOJ”), or other government entities, including state agencies.
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps before the product candidate will be licensed by the FDA:
  
• | preclinical testing including laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, which must be performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (“GLP”), regulations and standards;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current good clinical practices (“GCP”);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application (“NDA”), for a drug product which includes not only the results of the clinical trials, but also, detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture and quality controls for the product candidate and proposed labelling for one or more proposed indication(s);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product candidate or components thereof are manufactured to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”), requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and the
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 16

 
integrity of clinical data in support of the NDA;
-------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA to allow marketing of the new drug product; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) and the potential requirement to conduct any post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
 Before an applicant begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as other studies to evaluate, among other things, the toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 The IND and IRB Processes
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, on April 28, 2008, the FDA amended its regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application as support for an IND or a new drug application. The final rule provides that such studies must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”), including review and approval by an independent ethics committee (“IEC”), and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee (“DSMB”). This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of 
 17

development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Information about clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written clinical trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may also be required after approval.
 Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or in patients. During Phase 1 clinical trials, information about the investigational drug product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.
 Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 clinical trials are well controlled, closely monitored and conducted in a limited patient population.
 Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 clinical trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a drug: such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.” 
 In some cases, the FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of a larger number of patients in the intended treatment group and to further document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 Special Protocol Assessment
 The special protocol assessment (“SPA”) process is designed to facilitate the FDA’s review and approval of drugs by allowing the FDA to evaluate the proposed design and size of Phase 3 clinical trials that are intended to form the primary basis for determining a drug product’s efficacy. Upon specific request by a clinical trial sponsor, the FDA will evaluate the protocol and respond to a sponsor’s questions regarding, among other things, primary efficacy endpoints, trial design and data analysis plans, within 45 days of receipt of the request.
 The FDA ultimately assesses whether the protocol design and planned analysis of the trial are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the drug candidate with respect to effectiveness of the indication studied. All agreements and disagreements between the 
 18

FDA and the sponsor regarding an SPA must be clearly documented in an SPA letter or the minutes of a meeting between the sponsor and the FDA.
 Even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution and analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement under the following circumstances:
  
• | public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, or the director of the review division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy has been identified after testing has begun;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a sponsor fails to follow a protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the relevant data, assumptions or information provided by the sponsor in a request for SPA change, are found to be false statements or misstatements, or are found to omit relevant facts.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A documented SPA may be modified, and such modification will be deemed binding on the FDA review division, except under the circumstances described above, if FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study. Agreement by the FDA to the SPA does not guarantee that the results of a study conducted in accordance with the agreement will be successful or that other issues that arise may not impede approval of the investigational product.
 Review and Approval of an NDA
 In order to obtain approval to market a drug product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides sufficient data establishing the safety, purity and potency of the proposed drug product for its intended indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 The NDA is a vehicle through which applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new product for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. Every new drug product candidate must be the subject of an approved NDA before it may be commercialized in the United States. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2019 is $2,588,478 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2019 is $309,915. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.
 Following submission of an NDA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of the application generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities (“NMEs”), are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which the FDA accepts the application for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of products that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that the FDA receives the application. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 Before approving an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including component manufacturing, finished product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.  Under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain applications, including applications for products in shortage or those for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report. 
 19

In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular entity.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Special Expedited Review and Approval Programs
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation, regenerative advanced therapy designation and accelerated approval.
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. We have obtained Fast Track designation for azeliragon for the treatment of dementia of the Alzheimer’s type. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross‑disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case‑by‑case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment‑limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
 With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”), in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.
 Finally, the FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life‑threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”), and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.  The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional 
 20

post‑approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. 
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”).  ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Post-Approval Regulation
 If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that the FDA may have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and manufacturing problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.
 A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 21

The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In the United States, health care professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information.
 If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCA”), which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs 
 NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product for the proposed use. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.” 
 Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA (“Hatch-Waxman Act”), Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug (“RLD”). 
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.” Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is 
 22

“therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity (“NCE”), is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. 
 The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.
 The FDA must establish a priority review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within eight (8) months for a drug that has three (3) or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The new legislation also authorizes FDA to expedite review of ‘‘competitor generic therapies’’ or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application.
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
 • the required patent information has not been filed;
 • the listed patent has expired;
 • the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
 • the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval).
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 23

To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
  Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
Healthcare Law and Regulation
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations, include the following:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing •or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to health care items or services that are reimbursed by non-government third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 24

 Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Finally, based on the conduct of some of our clinical trials overseas, we are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that prohibits payments to foreign public officials relating to official acts. In addition to its prohibition on bribery of foreign government officials, the Act requires companies to maintain accurate records and have vigorous internal controls. The DOJ and SEC have made FCPA enforcement a high priority. In addition, other anti-corruption laws such as the UK Bribery Act are even broader than the FCPA in that they apply to bribes offered to any person, not just government officials. There are significant criminal and civil penalties and fines that attach to violations of the FCPA.
 Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage and Health Care Reform
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated health care costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
 The containment of health care costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and biologics and other medical products, government control and other changes to the health care system in the United States. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”) was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the ACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are, among others, the following:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drug agents or biologic agents, which is apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government health care programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 25

 
condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, unless the drug is subject to discounts under the 340B drug discount program;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | new requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act for drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;

 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, led to aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that started in 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. 
 These healthcare reforms, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price for any approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product. Reductions in reimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices or the frequency with which products are prescribed or administered.  Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.  Since enactment of the ACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law.  In May 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation known as the American Health Care Act of 2017.  Thereafter, the Senate Republicans introduced and then updated a bill to replace the ACA known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017. The Senate Republicans also introduced legislation to repeal the ACA without companion legislation to replace it, and a “skinny” version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017.  In addition, the Senate considered proposed healthcare reform legislation known as the Graham-Cassidy bill.  None of these measures was passed by the U.S. Senate. 
 The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA.  In January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices.  In October 2017, the President signed a second Executive Order allowing for the use of association health plans and short-term health insurance, which may provide fewer health benefits than the plans sold through the ACA exchanges.  At the same time, the Administration announced that it will discontinue the payment of cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments to insurance companies until Congress approves the appropriation of funds for such CSR payments. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the ACA.  A bipartisan bill to appropriate funds for CSR payments was introduced in the Senate, but the future of that bill is uncertain.

More recently, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by the President on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.”  The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, will become effective in 2019.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise.  Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices.  The Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA, during the next Congressional session.
 Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing.
 Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and may become subject to additional foreign regulations pertaining to commercial sales and distribution of our drug candidates to the extent we choose to clinically evaluate or sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved for sale outside the United States.
 
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union (“EU”) (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the United Kingdom provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the EU Treaty. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 52 employees, of which at least 20 hold graduate degrees (including 15 doctorate degrees) and 31 are engaged in full-time research and development activities. 
 On December 11, 2018, we initiated a corporate restructuring to align with a strategic decision to continue the development of our drug candidates using external resources rather than internal resources (the “Restructuring”). The Restructuring will allow us to reduce costs while continuing to conduct clinical trials, to support existing partnerships that are advancing development of additional assets, and to pursue new licensing and partnership opportunities. The Restructuring includes a reduction in our workforce affecting approximately 65% of our employees, as of December 31, 2018.
 None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
