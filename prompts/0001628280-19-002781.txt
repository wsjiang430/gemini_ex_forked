Item 1. | Business

COMPANY OVERVIEW
Commercial Vehicle Group, Inc. (through its subsidiaries) is a leading supplier of electrical wire harnesses, seating systems, and a full range of other cab related products for the global commercial vehicle markets, including the medium- and heavy-duty truck, medium-and heavy-construction vehicle, military, bus, agriculture, specialty transportation, mining, industrial equipment and off-road recreational markets. 
We have manufacturing operations in the United States, Mexico, China, United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Thailand, India and Australia. Our products are primarily sold in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.
In February 2019, the Company announced a strategic reorganization of its operations into two reportable segments, Electrical Systems Segment and Global Seating Segment. The Electrical Systems Segment, includes electrical wire harnesses and panel assemblies, trim systems and components ("Trim"), cab structures and sleeper boxes, mirrors, wipers and controls. The Global Seating Segment, includes seats and seating systems ("Seats"), office seating, and aftermarket seats and components. This reorganization will allow the Company to better focus its business along product lines, as opposed to end markets, which the Company believes will enhance the effectiveness of seeking out growth opportunities and shareholder value. With respect to the Electrical Systems segment, we believe there may be opportunities to realize certain synergies amongst the products in this segment, especially with respect to electrical wire harnesses and panel assemblies, trim systems and components, and mirrors, wipers, and controls. With respect to the Seating Segment, we believe combining the seating operations would provide us opportunities to leverage resources and best practices in engineering, product development, and manufacturing, while eliminating redundancies and providing a global, more scalable platform for effective and efficient operations.
We are differentiated from automotive industry suppliers by our ability to manufacture low volume, customized products on a sequenced basis to meet the requirements of our customers. We believe our products are used by a majority of the North America MD/HD Truck and many medium- and heavy-duty construction vehicle original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), and to a lesser extent other makers of industrial equipment.
Our Long-term Strategy
Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
SEGMENTS 
In the quarter ended December 31, 2018, we completed a strategic reorganization of our operations into two business segments, Electrical Systems and Global Seating. The reorganization will allow the Company to better focus its business along product lines, as opposed to end markets, which the company believes will enhance the effectiveness of seeking out growth opportunities and enhancing shareholder value. As a result of the strategic reorganization, we restated prior period segment information to conform to the current period segment presentation. See Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that are evaluated regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), which is our President and Chief Executive Officer. Each of these segments consists of a number of manufacturing facilities. Certain of our facilities manufacture and sell products through both of our segments. Each manufacturing facility that sells products through both segments is reflected in the financial results of the segment that has the greatest amount of revenues from that manufacturing facility.

OUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS
Industries Served
Commercial Vehicle Market. Commercial vehicles are used in a wide variety of end markets, including local and long-haul commercial trucking, bus, construction, mining, agricultural, military, industrial, municipal, off-road recreation and specialty vehicle markets. The commercial vehicle supply industry can generally be separated into two categories: (1) sales to OEMs, in which products are sold in relatively large quantities directly for use by OEMs in new commercial and construction vehicles; and (2) aftermarket sales, in which products are sold as replacements to a wide range of original equipment service organizations, wholesalers, retailers and installers. In the OEM market, suppliers are generally divided into tiers - “Tier 1” suppliers that provide products directly to OEMs, and “Tier 2” and “Tier 3” suppliers that sell products principally to other suppliers for integration into those suppliers’ own product offerings. We are generally a Tier I supplier.
The commercial vehicle supplier industry is fragmented and comprised of several large companies and many smaller companies. In addition, the commercial vehicle supplier industry is characterized by relatively low production volumes and can have considerable barriers to entry, including the following: (1) specific technical and manufacturing requirements, (2) high transition costs to shift production to new suppliers, (3) just-in-time delivery requirements and (4) strong brand name recognition. 
Although OEM demand for our products is directly correlated with new vehicle production, suppliers like us can grow by increasing sales by further penetrating existing customers’ businesses, gaining new customers, expanding into new geographic markets, developing new content in our products to meet changing customer needs and by increasing aftermarket sales. We believe that companies with a global presence, advanced technology, engineering and manufacturing and support capabilities, such as our company, are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.
North American Commercial Truck Market. Purchasers of commercial trucks include fleet operators, owner operators, governmental agencies and industrial end users. Commercial vehicles used for local and long-haul commercial trucking are generally classified by gross vehicle weight. Class 8 vehicles are trucks with gross vehicle weight in excess of 33,000 lbs. and Classes 5 through 7 vehicles are trucks with gross vehicle weight from 16,001 lbs. to 33,000 lbs. The following table shows production levels (in thousands of units) of commercial vehicles used for local and long-haul commercial trucking from 2014 through 2018 in North America:
4


 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018
Class 8 trucks | 297 | 323 | 228 | 256 | 324 
Class 5-7 trucks | 226 | 237 | 233 | 249 | 272 

Source: ACT N.A. (February 2019).
The following describes the major markets within the commercial vehicle market in which the Global Seating Segment competes:
Class 8 Truck Market. The global Class 8 ("Class 8" or "heavy-duty") truck manufacturing market is concentrated in three primary regions: North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. The global Class 8 truck market is localized in nature due to the following factors: (1) the prohibitive costs of shipping components from one region to another, (2) the high degree of customization to meet the region-specific demands of end-users, and (3) the ability to meet just-in-time delivery requirements. According to ACT Research four companies represented approximately 98% of the market share for North American Class 8 truck production in 2018. The percentages of North American heavy-duty production represented by Daimler, PACCAR, A.B. Volvo, and Navistar were approximately 37%, 30%, 17%, and 14%, respectively, in 2018. We supply products to all of these OEMs.
New Class 8 truck demand is cyclical and is particularly sensitive to economic factors that generate a significant portion of the freight tonnage hauled by commercial vehicles.
The following table illustrates North American Class 8 truck build for the years 2016 to 2023:
“E” — Estimated
Source: ACT (February 2019). 
We believe the following factors are primarily responsible for driving the North American Class 8 truck market:
Economic Conditions. The North American truck industry is influenced by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Since heavy-duty truck OEMs supply the fleet operators, their production levels generally reflect the demand for freight and the fleet operators' purchase of new vehicles. 
Truck Replacement Cycle and Fleet Aging.    The average age of the U.S. Class 8 truck population is approximately 11.2 years in 2018. The average fleet age tends to run in cycles as freight companies permit their truck fleets to age during periods of lagging demand and then replenish those fleets during periods of increasing demand. As truck fleets age, maintenance costs typically increase. Freight companies evaluate the economics between repair and replacement as well as the potential to utilize more cost-effective technology in vehicles. The chart below illustrates the approximate average age of the U.S. Class 8 truck population:

Class 5-7 Truck Market. North American Class 5-7 ("Class 5-7" or "medium-duty") includes recreational vehicles, buses and medium-duty trucks. We primarily participate in the Class 6 and 7 medium-duty truck market. The medium-duty truck market is influenced by overall economic conditions but has historically been less cyclical than the North American Class 8 truck market, with highs and lows generally not as pronounced as the Class 8 truck market. As the North American truck fleet companies move to a distribution center model, requiring less long-haul freight vehicles, the demand for medium-duty trucks may increase. 
The following table illustrates the North American Class 5-7 truck build for the years 2016 through 2023:

“E” — Estimated
Source: ACT (February 2019). 
Commercial Truck Aftermarket. Demand for aftermarket products is driven by the quality of OEM parts, the number of vehicles in operation, the average age of the vehicle fleet, the content and value per vehicle, vehicle usage and the average useful life of vehicle parts. Aftermarket sales tend to be at a higher margin. The recurring nature of aftermarket revenue can be expected to provide some insulation to the overall cyclical nature of the industry as it tends to provide a more stable stream of revenues. Brand equity and the extent of a company’s distribution network also contribute to the level of aftermarket sales. We believe CVG has a widely recognized brand portfolio and participates in most retail sales channels including Original Equipment Dealer networks and independent distributors. 
Commercial Construction Equipment Market.     New vehicle demand in the global construction equipment market generally follows certain economic conditions including GDP, infrastructure investment, housing starts, business investment, oil and energy investment and industrial production around the world. Within the construction market, there are two classes of construction equipment markets: the medium and heavy construction equipment market (weighing over 12 metric tons) and the light construction equipment market (weighing below 12 metric tons). Our construction equipment products are primarily used in the medium and heavy construction equipment markets. The platforms that we generally participate in include: cranes, pavers, planers and profilers, dozers, loaders, graders, haulers, tractors, excavators, backhoes, material handling and compactors. Demand in the medium and heavy construction equipment market is typically 
6

related to the level of larger-scale infrastructure development projects such as highways, dams, harbors, hospitals, airports and industrial development as well as activity in the mining, forestry and other commodities industries. 
Purchasers of medium and heavy construction equipment include construction companies, municipalities, local governments, rental fleet owners, quarrying and mining companies and forestry related industries. Purchasers of light construction equipment include contractors, rental fleet owners, landscapers, logistics companies and farmers. In the medium and heavy construction equipment market, we primarily supply OEMs with our wire harness and seating products.
Agricultural Equipment Market.     We market most of our products for small, medium and large agricultural equipment across a spectrum of machines including tractors, sprayers, bailers, farm telehandler equipment and harvesters. Sales and production of these vehicles can be influenced by rising or falling farm commodity prices, land values, profitability, and other factors such as increased mechanization in emerging economies and new uses for crop materials such as biofuels and other factors. In the medium to longer term, a combination of factors create the need for more productive agricultural equipment, such as: (1) population growth, (2) an evolving sophistication of dietary habits, and (3) constraints on arable land and other macroeconomic and demographic factors. 
Military Equipment Market.     We supply products for heavy- and medium-payload tactical trucks that are used by various military customers. Military equipment production is particularly sensitive to political and governmental budgetary considerations.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
A description of the principal raw materials we utilize in principal product categories are:
Electrical Wire Harnesses and Panel Assemblies.    The principal raw materials used to manufacture our electrical wire harnesses are wire and cable, connectors, terminals, switches, relays and various covering techniques involving braided yarn, braided copper, slit and non-slit conduit and molded foam. These raw materials are obtained from multiple suppliers and are generally available, although we have experienced and continue to experience a shortage of certain of these raw materials.
Trim Systems and Components.   The principal raw materials used in our Trim are resin and chemical products, foam, vinyl and fabric which are formed and assembled into end products. These raw materials are generally readily available from multiple suppliers.
Cab Structures and Sleeper Boxes.   The principal raw materials and components used in our cab structures and sleeper boxes are steel and aluminum. These raw materials are generally readily available and obtained from multiple suppliers.
Mirrors, Wipers and Controls.   The principal raw materials used to manufacture our mirrors, wipers and controls are steel, stainless steel, aluminum and rubber, which are generally readily available and obtained from multiple suppliers. We also purchase sub-assembled products, such as motors, for our mirrors, wipers and controls.
Seats and Seating Systems.    The principal raw materials used in our seats include steel, aluminum, resin-based products and foam products and are generally readily available and obtained from multiple suppliers under various supply agreements. Leather, vinyl, fabric and certain other components are also purchased from multiple suppliers.
Our Supply Agreements
Our supply agreements generally provide for fixed pricing but do not require us to purchase any specified quantities. Normally we do not carry inventories of raw materials or finished products in excess of what is reasonably required to meet production and shipping schedules, as well as service requirements. Steel, aluminum, petroleum-based products, copper, resin, foam, fabrics, wire and wire components comprise the most significant portion of our raw material costs. We typically purchase steel, copper and petroleum-based products at market prices that are fixed over varying periods of time. Due to the volatility in pricing over the last several years, we use methods such as market index pricing and competitive bidding to assist in reducing our overall cost. The recent imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum have impacted the prices of certain of our materials. Implementation of Brexit may result in supply disruptions. We strive to align our customer pricing and material costs to minimize the impact of steel, copper and petrochemical price fluctuations. Certain component purchases and suppliers are directed by our customers, so we generally will pass through directly to the customer cost changes from these components. We generally are not dependent on a single supplier or limited group of suppliers for our raw materials.
Research and Development
7

Our research and development capabilities offer quality and technologically advanced products to our customers at competitive prices. We offer product styling, product design, specialized simulation and testing and evaluation services that are necessary in today’s global markets. Our capabilities in acoustics, thermal efficiency, benchmarking, multi-axis durability, biomechanics, comfort, prototyping and process prove-out allow us to provide complete integrated solutions to the end-user.
We engage in global engineering, and research and development activities that improve the reliability, performance and cost-effectiveness of our existing products and support the design and development and testing of new products for existing and new applications. We have test and validation engineering centers in North America, Europe and Asia. We have a global engineering support center in India to provide a cost-effective global engineering resource to our seat facilities.
We believe we are staffed with experienced engineers and have equipment and technology to support early design involvement that results in products that timely meet or exceed the customer’s design and performance requirements, and are more efficient to manufacture. Our ability to support our products and customers with extensive on site involvement enhances our position for bidding on such business. We work aggressively to ensure that our quality and delivery metrics distinguish us from our competitors.
Generally, we work with our customers’ engineering and development teams at the beginning of the design process for new components and assemblies and systems, or the re-engineering process for existing components and assemblies, in order to leverage production efficiency and quality. Our customers are continuously searching for advanced products while maintaining cost, quality and performance deliverables.
Research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 totaled $9.5 million, $7.7 million and $7.0 million, respectively.
Intellectual Property
Our principal intellectual property consists of product and process technology and a limited number of U.S. and foreign patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights. Although our intellectual property is important to our business operations and in the aggregate constitutes a valuable asset, we do not believe that any single patent, trade secret, trademark or copyright, or group of patents, trade secrets, trademarks or copyrights is critical to the success of our business. Our policy is to seek statutory protection for all significant intellectual property embodied in patents, trademarks and copyrights.
Our major brands include CVG™, Sprague Devices®, Moto Mirror®, RoadWatch®, KAB Seating™, National Seating™, Bostrom Seating®, Stratos™ and FinishTEK™. We believe that our brands are valuable but that our business is not dependent on any one brand. We own U.S. federal trademark registrations for several of our products.
Manufacturing Processes
A description of the manufacturing processes we utilize for each of our principal product categories is set forth below:
Electrical Wire Harnesses and Panel Assemblies.    We utilize several manufacturing techniques to produce our electrical wire harnesses and panel assemblies. Our processes, manual and automated, are designed to produce a wide range of wire harnesses and panel assemblies in short time frames. Our wire harnesses and panel assemblies are electronically and hand tested.
Trim Systems and Components.    Our Trim capabilities include injection molding, low-pressure injection molding, urethane molding and foaming processes, compression molding, heavy-gauge thermoforming and vacuum forming as well as various cutting, sewing, trimming and finishing methods.
Cab Structures and Sleeper Boxes.    We utilize a wide range of manufacturing processes to produce our cab structures and sleeper boxes and utilize robotic and manual welding techniques in the assembly of these products. Large capacity, fully automated E-coat paint priming systems allow us to provide our customers with a paint-ready cab product. Due to their high cost, full body E-coat systems, such as ours, are rarely found outside of the manufacturing operations of the major OEMs.
Mirrors, Wipers and Controls.    We manufacture our mirrors, wipers and controls utilizing a variety of manufacturing processes and techniques. Our mirrors, wipers and controls are primarily assembled utilizing semi-automatic work cells and are electronically tested.
Seats and Seating Systems.    Our seats utilize a variety of manufacturing techniques whereby foam and various other components along with fabric, vinyl or leather are affixed to an underlying seat frame. We also manufacture and assemble seat frames.
8

We have a broad array of processes to enable us to meet our OEM customers’ styling and cost requirements. The vehicle cab is the most significant and appealing aspect to the operator of the vehicle. Each commercial vehicle OEM therefore has unique requirements as to feel, appearance and features.
The end markets for our products can be highly specialized and our customers frequently request modified products in low volumes within an expedited delivery timeframe. As a result, we primarily utilize flexible manufacturing cells at our production facilities. Manufacturing cells are clusters of individual manufacturing operations and work stations. This provides flexibility by allowing efficient changes to the number of operations each operator performs. When compared to the more traditional, less flexible assembly line process, cell manufacturing allows us to better maintain our product output consistent with our OEM customers’ requirements and minimize the level of inventory.
When an end-user buys a commercial vehicle, the end-user may specify the seat and other features for that vehicle. Because our Seats are unique, our manufacturing facilities have significant complexity which we manage by building in sequence. We build our Seats as orders are received, and the Seats are delivered to our customers in the sequence in which vehicles come down the assembly line. We have systems in place that allow us to provide complete customized interior kits in boxes that are delivered in sequence. Sequencing reduces our cost of production because it eliminates warehousing costs and reduces waste and obsolescence, thereby offsetting increased labor costs. Several of our manufacturing facilities are strategically located near our customers’ assembly facilities, which facilitates this process and minimizes shipping costs.
We employ just-in-time manufacturing and sourcing in our operations to meet customer requirements for faster deliveries and to minimize our need to carry significant inventory levels. We utilize material systems to manage inventory levels and, in certain locations, we have inventory delivered as often as two times per day from a nearby facility based on the previous day’s order, which reduces the need to carry excess inventory at our facilities.
Within our cyclical industries, we strive to maintain a certain portion of temporary labor to improve our ability to flex our costs and throughput as required by fluctuating customer demand. We engage our core employees to assist in making our processes efficient. 
Seasonality
OEMs close their production facilities around holidays or when demand drops, reducing work days. Our cost structure, to the extent it is variable, provides us with some flexibility during these periods.
Our Customer Contracts, and Sales and Marketing
Our OEM customers generally source business to us pursuant to written contracts, purchase orders or other commitments (“Commercial Arrangements”) with terms of price, quality, technology and delivery. Awarded business generally covers the supply of all or a portion of a customer’s production and service requirements for a particular product program rather than the supply of a specific quantity of products. In general, these Commercial Arrangements provide that the customer can terminate them if we do not meet specified quality, delivery and cost requirements. Although these Commercial Arrangements may be terminated at any time by our customers (but not by us), such terminations have historically been minimal and have not had a material impact on our results of operations. Because we produce products for a broad cross section of vehicle models, we are not overly reliant on any one vehicle model.
Our Commercial Arrangements with our OEM customers may provide for an annual prospective productivity price reduction. These productivity price reductions are generally calculated on an annual basis as a percentage of the previous year’s purchases by each customer. Historically, most of these price reductions have been offset by internal cost reductions and through the assistance of our supply base, although no assurances can be given that we will be able to achieve such reductions in the future. The cost reduction is achieved through engineering changes, material cost reductions, logistics savings, reductions in packaging cost, labor efficiencies and other productivity actions. 
Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to create customer awareness of our engineering, design and manufacturing capabilities. Our sales and marketing staff work closely with our design and engineering personnel to prepare the materials used for bidding on new business, as well as to provide an interface between us and our key customers. We have sales and marketing personnel located in every major region in which we operate. From time to time, we participate in industry trade shows and advertise in industry publications.
Our principal customers for our aftermarket sales include OEM dealers and independent wholesale or retail distributors. Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on supporting these two distribution channels, as well as participation in industry trade shows and direct contact with major fleets.

Our primary competitors in the European commercial vehicle market include Grammer AG and Isringhausen; and in the Asia-Pacific region include Isrihuatai and Tiancheng (in China); and Harita and Pinnacle (in India).
Competitive Strengths
Generally, the barriers to entry in our business include investment, specific engineering requirements, transition costs for OEMs to shift production to new suppliers, just-in-time delivery requirements and brand name recognition. Our competitive strengths include the following:
Market Positions and Brands.    We believe we have a strong market position supplying Seats and a good market position supplying Trim products to the North American MD/HD Truck market. Our market position in the North American MD/HD Truck market leads us to believe we have processes in place to design, manufacture and introduce products that meet customers’ expectations in that market. We also believe we are competitive as a global supplier of construction vehicle Seats. Our major product brands include CVG™, Sprague Devices®, Moto Mirror®, RoadWatch®, KAB Seating™, National Seating™, Bostrom Seating®, Stratos™ and FinishTEK™.
Commercial Vehicle Solutions.    We manufacture a broad base of products utilized in the interior and the exterior of commercial vehicles. We believe the breadth of our product offerings provide us with a potential opportunity for further customer penetration by bundling our products to provide complete system solutions.
End-User Focused Product Innovation.    Commercial vehicle OEMs focus on interior and exterior product design features that better serve the vehicle operator and therefore seek suppliers that can provide product innovation. Accordingly, we have engineering, and research and development capabilities to assist OEMs in meeting those needs. We believe this helps us secure content on new as well as current platforms and models.
Flexible Manufacturing Capabilities.    Because commercial vehicle OEMs permit their customers to select from an extensive menu of cab options, our end users frequently request modified products in low volumes within a limited time frame. We can leverage our flexible manufacturing capabilities to provide low volume, customized products to meet styling, cost and just-in-time delivery requirements. We manufacture or assemble our products in facilities in North America, Europe and in the Asia-Pacific region.
Lean Manufacturing. We began what we refer to as our "Operational Excellence" program, which is based on Lean Six-Sigma concepts, in 2015. The program has trained approximately 2,300 CVG employees to achievement levels ranging from yellow belt to black belt in the Lean Six-Sigma concepts. We believe the Lean or Six-Sigma projects make significant and sustainable improvement in processes, products or services leading to sizable contributions that help off-set inflation and enhance margins.

CVG Digital. We began a digital transformation in 2017 as a part of a multi-year plan. As a part of this program, we have standardized our real-time production data collection and electronic display methods. We have also standardized our downtime detection and problem solving systems based on the use of electronic alerts. This type of real-time production floor monitoring and data-driven problem solving approach improves accountability, drives ownership, and enhances employee engagement leading to tangible improvement in asset utilization, labor efficiency, quality, and employee retention.
Global Capabilities.    We have sales, engineering, manufacturing and assembly capabilities in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region that provide a high level of service to our customers who manufacture and sell their products on a global basis.
Relationships with Leading Customers and Major North American Fleets.    We have comprehensive product offerings, brand names and product features that enable us to be a global supplier to many of the leading MD/HD Truck, construction and specialty commercial vehicle manufacturers such as PACCAR, Caterpillar, Volvo/Mack, Navistar, Daimler Trucks, John Deere, Oshkosh Corporation, Komatsu and Škoda (part of the Volkswagen Group). In addition, we maintain relationships with the major MD/HD Truck fleets that are end-users of our products such as Schneider National, Werner, Walmart, FedEx and JB Hunt.
Management Team.    We believe that our management team has substantial knowledge of our customer needs and expertise in critical operational areas, and has a demonstrated ability to manage costs, improve processes and expand revenue through product, market, geography and customer diversification.
Backlog
Our customers may place annual blanket purchase orders that do not obligate them to purchase any specific or minimum amount of products from us until a release is issued by the customer under the blanket purchase order. Releases are typically placed 30 to 90 days prior to required delivery and may be canceled within agreed terms. We do not believe that our backlog of expected product sales covered by firm purchase orders is a meaningful indicator of future sales since orders may be rescheduled or canceled.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 8,355 permanent employees, of whom approximately 15% were salaried and the remainder were hourly. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 53% of the employees in our North American operations were unionized, with the majority of union-represented personnel based in Mexico. Approximately 68% of our European, Asian and Australian operations were represented by shop steward committees.
We did not experience any material strikes, lockouts or work stoppages during 2018 and consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.  On an as-needed basis during peak periods we utilize contract and temporary employees.  During periods of weak demand, we respond to reduced volumes through flexible scheduling, furloughs and/or reductions in force as necessary. 
Environmental Matters
We are subject to foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety, including laws regulating air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the soil, ground or air; and the health and safety of our colleagues. We are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. We are also subject to laws imposing liability for the cleanup of contaminated property. Under these laws, we could be held liable for costs and damages relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party sites to which we sent waste containing hazardous substances. 
Government Regulations
New emissions regulations were approved in 2016 by US regulators impacting MD/HD Truck manufacturers. The regulations require manufacturers to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2027. Other countries are implementing clean air measures to reduce air pollution. For example, China's Ministry of Environment implemented new standards applicable beginning in 2017 for Stage V vehicles, including light gasoline-powered vehicles, diesel-powered passenger vehicles and heavy diesel-powered vehicles manufactured and sold in China. 
Under a California law known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction, a warning must appear on any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance. The state maintains 
11

lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to them. Certain of our products are subject to Proposition 65, which does not provide for any generally applicable quantitative threshold below which the presence of a listed substance is exempt from the warning requirement. Consequently, the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. We provide warnings on our products in California. 
To the extent that current or future governmental regulation has a negative impact on the demand for commercial vehicles, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.
