OC-BVI also pays our subsidiary, DesalCo, fees for certain engineering and administrative services. We account for our investment in OC-BVI under the equity method of accounting.
​
Discontinued Operations - Mexico Project Development
​
Consolidated Water Cooperatief, U.A. (“CW-Cooperatief”), N.S.C. Agua, S.A. de C.V. (“NSC”) and Aguas de Rosarito S.A.P.I. de C.V. (“AdR”). CW-Cooperatief is a wholly-owned Netherlands subsidiary incorporated in 2010. CW-Cooperatief owns 99.9% of NSC, a Mexican company. NSC was formed to pursue a project encompassing the design, construction, ownership and operation of a 100 million gallon per day seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant which 

6



was to be located in northern Baja California, Mexico and accompanying pipeline to deliver water to the Mexican potable water system (the “Project”).
​
On August 22, 2016, the Public Private Partnership Agreement for the Project (the “APP Contract”) was executed between AdR, the Comisión Estatal del Agua de Baja California (“CEA”), the Government of Baja California as represented by the Secretary of Planning and Finance and the Public Utilities Commission of Tijuana (“CESPT”).
​
On June 29, 2020, the Director General of CEA and the Director General of CESPT terminated the APP Contract. As a result of the cancellation of the APP Contract, we discontinued all development activities associated with the Project and commenced active marketing efforts to sell the land NSC purchased for the Project. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of CW-Cooperatief, NSC and AdR, as well as all expenses we incur in connection with our on-going international arbitration with the Mexico government to obtain reimbursement for the costs we incurred in connection with the Project are reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.
​
Our Operations
​
For fiscal year 2022, our retail water, bulk water, services and manufacturing segments generated approximately 27%, 35%, 31% and 7%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. For additional information about our business segments and geographical information about our operating revenue and long-lived assets, see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements at ITEM 8 of this Annual Report.
​
Retail Water Operations
​
For fiscal years 2022 and 2021, our retail water operations accounted for approximately 27%, and 33%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. This business produces and supplies potable water to end-users, including residential, commercial and government customers in the Cayman Islands.
​
We sell water through our retail operations under a license issued in July 1990 by the Cayman Islands government (the “1990 license”) that granted Cayman Water the exclusive right to provide potable water to customers within its licensed service area. Although the 1990 license was not expressly extended after January 2018, we continue to supply water under the terms of the 1990 license, as discussed in the following paragraphs. Pursuant to the 1990 license, Cayman Water has the exclusive right to produce potable water and distribute it by pipeline to its licensed service area, which consists of two of the three most populated areas of Grand Cayman: Seven Mile Beach and West Bay.
​
The 1990 license was originally scheduled to expire in July 2010 but was extended several times by the Cayman Islands government in order to provide the parties with additional time to negotiate the terms of a new license agreement. The most recent express extension of the license expired on January 31, 2018. We continue to operate under the terms of the 1990 license, providing water services to the level and quality specified in the 1990 license and in accordance with our understanding of its legal obligations, treating those obligations set forth in the 1990 license as operative notwithstanding the expiration of the express extension. We continue to pay the royalty of 7.5% of revenue we collect required under the 1990 license.
​
In October 2016, the Government of the Cayman Islands passed legislation which created a new utilities regulation and competition office (“OfReg”). OfReg is an independent and accountable regulatory body with a view of protecting the rights of consumers, encouraging affordable utility services and promoting competition. OfReg, which began operations in January 2017, has the ability to supervise, monitor and regulate multiple utility undertakings and markets. Supplemental legislation was passed by the Government of the Cayman Islands in April 2017, which transferred responsibility for economic regulation of the water utility sector and the negotiations with us for a new retail license from the WAC to OfReg in May 2017. We began license negotiations with OfReg in July 2017 and such negotiations are ongoing. We have been informed during our retail license negotiations, both by OfReg and its predecessor in these negotiations, that the Cayman Islands government seeks to restructure the terms of our license in a manner that could significantly reduce the operating income and cash flows we have historically generated from our retail license.

​
Our retail operations in the Cayman Islands produce potable water at four seawater reverse osmosis desalination plants in Grand Cayman located at our Abel Castillo Water Works (“ACWW”), Britannia and West Bay sites. We own the land for our ACWW and West Bay plants and have entered into a lease for the land for our Britannia plant that expires January 1, 2027. The current aggregate production capacity of the two plants located at ACWW is 3.0 million gallons of water per day. The production capacity of the Britannia plant is 715,000 gallons of water per day. The production capacity of the West Bay plant is 885,000 gallons of water per day.
​
Electricity to our plants is supplied by Caribbean Utilities Co. Ltd., a publicly traded utility company. We maintain diesel engine-driven standby generators at all three retail plant sites with sufficient capacity to operate our distribution pumps and other essential equipment during any temporary interruptions in electricity supply. Standby generation capacity is available at our ACWW plants and West Bay plant to operate a portion of the water production capacity as well.
​
Our distribution system is connected to the distribution system of the WAC. In prior years, during emergencies, we have purchased water from the WAC for brief periods of time and have also sold potable water to the WAC from our retail plants.
​
Our pipeline system on Grand Cayman covers the Seven Mile Beach and West Bay areas and consists of approximately 100 miles of potable water pipeline. We extend our distribution system periodically as demand warrants. We have a main pipe loop covering the Seven Mile Beach and West Bay areas. We place extensions of smaller diameter pipe off our main pipe to service new developments in our service area. This system of building branches from the main pipe keeps construction costs low and allows us to provide service to new areas in a timely manner. Developers are responsible for laying the pipeline within their developments at their own cost, but in accordance with our specifications. When a development is completed, the developer then transfers operation and maintenance of the pipeline to us.
​
We bill our customers on a monthly basis based on metered consumption and bills are typically collected within 30 to 45 days after the billing date. Receivables not collected within 45 days subject the customer to disconnection from water service. Bad debts have historically represented less than 1% of our total annual retail sales. In addition to their past due invoice balance, customers that have had their service disconnected must pay re-connection charges.
​
Historically, demand on our water production and pipeline distribution has varied throughout the year. Demand depends upon various factors, most notably rainfall amounts and the number of tourists during any particular time of the year. In general, the majority of tourists come from the United States during the winter which is also the dry season in the Cayman Islands. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting cessation of tourism to the Cayman Islands significantly reduced demand for our water. In August 2022, the Cayman Islands government lifted the COVID-19 pandemic related travel restrictions that had eliminated tourist travel to the Cayman Islands since March 2020.
​
Bulk Water Operations
​
For fiscal years 2022 and 2021, our bulk water operations accounted for approximately 35%, and 40%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. These operations produce potable water from seawater and sell this water to government-owned utilities in the Cayman Islands and The Bahamas, which then distribute the water to end users.
​
Bulk Water Operations in the Cayman Islands
​
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary OC-Cayman we provide bulk water to the WAC, a government-owned utility and regulatory agency, under two agreements. The WAC in turn distributes that water to properties in Grand Cayman outside of our retail license area.
​
The water we provide to the WAC is produced at three seawater reverse osmosis desalination plants in Grand Cayman owned by the WAC but designed, built and operated by OC-Cayman: the North Sound, Red Gate and North Side Water 

8



Works (“NSWW”) plants, which have production capacities of approximately 1.6 million, 1.3 million and 2.4 million gallons of water per day, respectively. The plants we operate for the WAC are located on land owned by the WAC.
​
Our agreement with the WAC for the North Sound and Red Gate plants expires in 2024. Our agreement with the WAC for the NSWW plant expires in 2026.
​
Bulk Water Operations in The Bahamas
​
We sell bulk water in The Bahamas through our majority-owned subsidiary, CW-Bahamas, to the WSC, which distributes the water through its own pipeline system to residential, commercial and tourist properties on the Island of New Providence.
​
We supply bulk water in The Bahamas from our Windsor and Blue Hills plants.
​
Our water supply agreement with the WSC for our Windsor plant, which has a capacity of 2.8 million gallons per day, expires in August 2033 and requires us to deliver and requires the WSC to purchase a minimum of 16.8 million gallons per week.
​
We supply water from the Blue Hills plant, our largest seawater reverse osmosis desalination facility with a capacity of 12.0 million gallons per day, under the terms of a water supply agreement with the WSC that expires in March 2032 that requires us to deliver and requires the WSC to purchase a minimum of 63.0 million gallons of water each week.
​
The high-pressure pumps at our Windsor and Blue Hills plants in The Bahamas are diesel engine-driven. Electricity for the remainder of our plant operations is supplied by Bahamas Power and Light Company (“BPL”). We maintain a standby generator with sufficient capacity to operate essential equipment at our Windsor and Blue Hills plants and are able to produce 100% of the production capacity with these plants during temporary interruptions in the electricity supply from BPL.
​
Services Operations
​
For fiscal years 2022 and 2021, our services operations accounted for approximately 31% and 21%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue.
​
We provide design, engineering and construction services for desalination infrastructure projects through DesalCo, an original equipment manufacturer of seawater reverse osmosis desalination plants. DesalCo also provides management and procurement services for desalination plants and engineering services relating to municipal water production, distribution and treatment. DesalCo also conducts research and development. DesalCo sometimes tests new components and technology offered by suppliers in our business and, at times, collaborates with suppliers in the development of their products. Presently, DesalCo is providing management and purchasing services to our affiliate OC-BVI in the British Virgin Islands. In the past, DesalCo has provided consulting services to the WSC and constructed and sold desalination plants to the WAC, and is presently constructing the Red Gate desalination plant for the WAC.
​
On October 24, 2019, we acquired 51% of the common stock of PERC, a U.S. company headquartered in Fountain Valley, California, which commenced operations in 1998. In August 2020, we acquired an additional 10% of PERC, increasing our ownership of this subsidiary to 61%. PERC develops, builds, and sells wastewater and water reuse infrastructure. PERC also provides management services for wastewater and water reuse infrastructure under long-term operations and maintenance contracts. PERC’s primary markets are California and the Southwest U.S., but it conducts business in other areas of the U.S. In January 2023, we acquired the remaining 39% ownership interest in PERC.
​
Manufacturing Operations
​
For fiscal years 2022 and 2021, our manufacturing operations accounted for approximately 7% and 6%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. Our manufacturing operations consist of Aerex, an original equipment manufacturer and service provider of a wide range of specialized and custom products applicable to desalination, municipal water treatment and 

9



industrial water and wastewater treatment. Aerex’s products include reverse osmosis desalination equipment, membrane separation equipment, filtration equipment, piping systems, vessels and custom fabricated components. Aerex’s manufacturing facility and headquarters are located in Fort Pierce, Florida and substantially all of its customers are U.S. companies.
​
Affiliate Operations
​
Our affiliate, OC-BVI, sells water to the Government of the British Virgin Islands Water and Sewerage Department (“BVIW&S”). We own 50% of the voting shares of OC-BVI and have an overall 43.53% equity interest in the profits of OC-BVI. We also own separate profit-sharing rights in OC-BVI that raise our effective interest in OC-BVI’s profits from 43.53% to approximately 45%. Sage Water Holdings (BVI) Limited (“Sage”) owns the remaining 50% of the voting shares of OC-BVI and the remaining 55% interest in its profits. Under the Articles of Association of OC-BVI, we have the right to appoint three of the six Directors of OC-BVI. Sage is entitled to appoint the remaining three Directors. In the event of a tied vote of the Directors, the President of the Caribbean Water and Wastewater Association, a regional trade association comprised primarily of government representatives, is entitled to appoint a junior director to cast a deciding vote.
​
Through DesalCo, we provide certain engineering and administrative services to OC-BVI for a monthly fee and a bonus arrangement which provides for payment of 4% of the net operating income of OC-BVI.
​
We account for our investment in OC-BVI using the equity method of accounting.
​
OC-BVI sells bulk water to BVIW&S, which distributes the water through its own pipeline system to residential, commercial and tourist properties on the islands of Tortola and Jost Van Dyke in the British Virgin Islands.
​
OC-BVI owns and operates a desalination plant located at Bar Bay, Tortola with a capacity of 720,000 gallons per day. Pursuant to a water supply agreement with the BVI government, OC-BVI is required to supply up to 600,000 gallons per day to the BVI government. This water supply agreement expires March 2031.
​
OC-BVI purchases electrical power to operate this plant from BVI Electric Co. and operates diesel engine-driven emergency power generators which can produce 100% of the plant’s production capacity when BVI Electric Co. is unable to provide power to the plant.
​
OC-BVI’s plant on the island of Jost Van Dyke has a capacity of 60,000 gallons per day. This plant operates under a 10-year contract with the BVI government that expired July 8, 2013. Pursuant to the contract, OC-BVI is operating the plant on a year-to-year basis until the BVI government informs OC-BVI of its intention to extend the existing contract or enter into a new agreement. We purchase electrical power to operate this plant from BVI Electric Co.
​
Reverse Osmosis Technology
​
The conversion of seawater to potable water is called desalination. The primary method of seawater desalination used throughout the world is reverse osmosis. Reverse osmosis is a fluid separation process in which the saline water (i.e. seawater) is pressurized and the fresh water is separated from the saline water by passing through a semi-permeable membrane which rejects the salts. The saline water is first passed through a pretreatment system, which generally consists of fine filtration and treatment chemicals, if required. Pre-treatment removes suspended solids and organics which could cause fouling of the membrane surface. Next, a high-pressure pump pressurizes the saline water thus enabling approximately 40% conversion of the saline water to fresh water as it passes through the membrane, while more than 99% of the dissolved salts are rejected and remain in the now concentrated saline water. This concentrate is discharged without passing through the membrane, and the remaining hydraulic energy in the concentrate is transferred to the initial saline feed water with an energy recovery device thus reducing the total energy requirement for the reverse osmosis system. The final step is post-treatment, which consists of stabilizing the produced fresh water and/or removing undesirable dissolved gases, adjusting the pH and (if necessary) the mineral content, and providing chlorination to prepare it for distribution.
​
We use reverse osmosis technology to convert seawater to potable water at all of the desalination plants we construct and operate. We believe that this technology is the most effective and efficient conversion process for our markets. However, 

10



we are always seeking ways to maximize efficiencies in our current processes and investigating new, more efficient processes to convert seawater to potable water. The equipment at our desalination plants is among the most energy efficient available and we monitor and maintain the equipment in an efficient manner. As a result of our decades of experience in seawater desalination, we believe our expertise and experience with respect to the development and operation of desalination plants and similar facilities is easily transferable to locations outside of our current operating areas.
​
Wastewater Treatment Technology
​
Our wastewater treatment comprises various technologies which rely on the action of microorganisms to treat wastewater. The sequential batch reactor (“SBR”) technology we typically use is a conventional, proven method which has been used to treat organic wastewater for many years. More than 1,000 SBR treatment facilities are in use in the United States ranging in size from 10,000 gallons per day to 22 million gallons per day. Increasingly, we utilize membrane bioreactor (“MBR”) technology which utilizes micro or ultra-filtration membranes to enhance biological wastewater treatment. The improvements offered by MBR technology include a reduced physical footprint for the facility, higher quality treated effluent and the ability to treat more challenging influent.
​
PERC has improved upon the standard SBR and MBR processes and whenever possible locates its equipment in concealed areas and in aesthetically pleasing buildings that minimize foul odors.
​
Raw Materials and Sources of Supply
​
All materials, parts and supplies essential to our business operations are obtained from multiple sources and we use the latest industry technology. Prior to our acquisition of Aerex, we did not manufacture any parts or components for equipment essential to our business. Aerex has manufactured key components for some of our desalination plants and we expect Aerex to continue to do so from time to time, however, our other businesses are not dependent on Aerex.
​
Our access to seawater for processing into potable water is granted through our licenses and contracts with governments of the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
​
Seasonal Variations in Our Business
​
Demand for our water in the Cayman Islands, The Bahamas and the British Virgin Islands is affected by variations in the level of tourism and rainfall. Tourism in our service areas is affected by the economies of the tourists’ home countries, primarily the United States and Europe, terrorist activity and perceived threats thereof, global health concerns such as COVID-19, and increased costs of fuel and airfare. In the Cayman Islands, we normally sell more water during the first and second quarters of the year, when the number of tourists is greater and local rainfall is less than in the third and fourth quarters. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting cessation of tourism to the Cayman Islands significantly reduced demand for our water in 2021. In August 2022, the Cayman Islands government lifted the COVID-19 pandemic related travel restrictions that had eliminated tourist travel to the Cayman Islands since March 2020. Demand in The Bahamas was not affected to the same degree by the drop in tourism resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
​
The business conducted by Aerex and PERC is generally not subject to seasonal variations.
​
Government Regulations, Custom Duties and Taxes
​
Our operations and activities are subject to the governmental regulations and taxes of the countries in which we operate. The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation does not purport to describe all present and proposed regulation and legislation that may affect our businesses. Legislative or regulatory requirements currently applicable to our businesses may change in the future. Any such changes could impose new obligations on us that may adversely affect our businesses and operating results. The following paragraphs set forth some of the key governmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate outside of the United States.
​

11



Cayman Islands
​
The Cayman Islands are a British Overseas Territory with a stable political climate since 1670, when the Treaty of Madrid ceded the Cayman Islands to England. The King of England appoints the Governor of the Cayman Islands to make laws with the advice and consent of the Parliament of the Cayman Islands. The Parliament of the Cayman Islands consists of 19 elected members and two members appointed by the Governor from the Civil Service. The Cabinet is responsible for day-to-day government operations. The Cabinet consists of the Premier and six other ministers who are chosen by the Premier from its 19 popularly elected members, and the two Civil Service members. The elected members choose from among themselves a leader, who is designated the Premier, and is in effect the leader of the elected government. The Governor has reserved powers and the United Kingdom retains full control over foreign affairs and defense. The Cayman Islands are a common law jurisdiction and have adopted a legal system similar to that of the United Kingdom.
​
The Cayman Islands have no taxes on profits, income, distributions, capital gains or appreciation. We have exemptions from, or receive concessionary rates of customs duties on, certain capital expenditures for plant and major consumable spare parts and supplies imported into the Cayman Islands under our retail water license. We do not pay import duty or taxes on reverse osmosis membranes, electric pumps and motors, and chemicals, but we do pay duty at the rate of 10% of the cost, including insurance and transportation to the Cayman Islands, of other plant and associated materials and equipment to manufacture or supply water in the Seven Mile Beach or West Bay areas. We have been advised by the Government of the Cayman Islands that we will not receive any duty concessions in any new retail water license signed with the government.
​
The Bahamas
​
The Commonwealth of The Bahamas is an independent nation and a constitutional parliamentary democracy with the King of England as the constitutional head of state. The basis of the Bahamian law and legal system is the English common law tradition with a Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, and a Magistrates court.
​
Under the current laws of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, no income, corporation, capital gains or similar taxes are payable by us. We are required to pay an annual business license fee (the calculation of which is based on our preceding year’s financial statements) which to date has not been material to the results of our Bahamas operations. We are also required to pay a value added tax on materials and services we purchase.
​
British Virgin Islands
​
The British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) is a British Overseas Territory, with the King of England as the Head of State and His Majesty’s representative, the Governor, responsible for external affairs, defense and internal security, the Civil Service and administration of the courts. Since 1967, the BVI has held responsibility for its own internal affairs.
​
The BVI Constitution provides for the people of the BVI to be represented by a ministerial system of government, led by an elected Premier, a Cabinet of Ministers and the House of Assembly. The House of Assembly consists of 13 elected representatives, the Attorney General, and the Speaker.
​
The judicial system, based on English law, is under the direction of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, which includes the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal. The ultimate appellate court is the Privy Council in London.
​
Markets and Service Areas
​
We operate in the Cayman Islands, The Bahamas, the United States and the British Virgin Islands. We believe that potential new markets for us include (i) any location where a need for potable water exists and reverse osmosis desalination of seawater or brackish water is an economically viable means of meeting such need; (ii) any location with a need for the water treatment and water reuse infrastructure development and management services we provide; and (iii) those new customers that require specialized water production and treatment products and systems such as those we manufacture.
​

Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands government, through the WAC, supplies water to the areas of Grand Cayman that are not within our licensed area, as well as to Cayman Brac. We operate all but one of the reverse osmosis desalination plants owned by the WAC on Grand Cayman and supply water under two agreements held by OC-Cayman with the WAC.
​
According to the most recent information published by the Economics and Statistics Office of the Cayman Islands Government, the population of the Cayman Islands was estimated in 2021 to be 71,105 after the census count. According to the figures published by the Department of Tourism Statistics Information Center, in 2022 as compared to 2021, tourist air arrivals increased over 1000% to approximately 284,000 and tourist cruise ship arrivals increased from zero to approximately 743,000.
​
We believe that our water sales in the Cayman Islands are more positively impacted by stay-over tourists that arrive by air than by those arriving by cruise ship, since cruise ship tourists generally only visit the island for one day or less and do not remain on the island overnight. Our water sales in the Cayman Islands are also greatly impacted by rainfall patterns and amounts on Grand Cayman.
​
The Bahamas. The Bahamas government, through the WSC, supplies all of the piped water on the island of New Providence, Bahamas, which includes Nassau, the largest city, political capital and commercial hub of The Bahamas. We supply water to the WSC through the water supply agreements for our Blue Hills and Windsor plants, which are located in Nassau. New Providence is the most populous island in The Bahamas, with more than 70% of the country’s population. A 2010 census placed the population of New Providence at approximately 246,000; more recent estimates suggest it is approximately 275,000. According to statistics published by the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism, the number of cruise ship arrival and air arrival tourists to New Providence were approximately 590,000 and 320,000, respectively, in 2020 and were approximately 465,000 and 650,000, respectively, in 2021. The most current data published by the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism for 2022 shows that the number of cruise ship arrival and air arrival tourists were approximately 2,136,000 and 1,137,000, respectively.
​
British Virgin Islands. The British Virgin Islands are a British Overseas Territory and are situated east of Puerto Rico. They consist of 16 inhabited and more than 20 uninhabited islands, of which Tortola is the largest and most populated. The British Virgin Islands serve as a hub for many large yacht-chartering businesses.
​
Competition
​
Cayman Islands. Pursuant to our license granted by the Cayman Islands government, we have the exclusive right to provide potable, piped water within our licensed service area on Grand Cayman. The last express extension of this license expired on January 31, 2018. However, we continue to operate under the terms of this license, providing water services to the level and quality specified in the 1990 license and in accordance with its legal obligations, treating those obligations set forth in the license as operative notwithstanding the expiration of the express extension. Negotiations for a new license are on-going.
​
We are the only non-government-owned public water utility on Grand Cayman. The Cayman Islands government, through the WAC, supplies water to parts of Grand Cayman located outside of our licensed service area. Although we have no competition within our exclusive retail license service area for potable water, our ability to expand our service area is at the discretion of the Cayman Islands government. We have competed with such companies as SUEZ/Veolia, IDE Technologies and small local contractors for bulk water supply contracts with the WAC and expect to compete with these and other companies for any new water supply contracts awarded by the WAC.
​
The Bahamas. We have competed with companies such as SUEZ/Veolia, IDE Technologies, and TSG for the contracts with The Bahamas government to build and operate seawater desalination plants in the past. We expect to compete with these companies and others for any future water supply contracts in The Bahamas.
​
British Virgin Islands. In the British Virgin Islands, SUEZ/Veolia operates seawater reverse osmosis desalination plants in West End, Tortola, and on Virgin Gorda and generally bids against OC-BVI for projects. Seven Seas Water owns and operates a 2.75 million gallon per day desalination plant in Parakeeta Bay, Tortola for the British Virgin Islands

government. We expect that OC-BVI will be required to compete against SUEZ/Veolia, Seven Seas Water and other parties for any future business opportunities that may arise in the British Virgin Islands.
​
United States. Aerex competes in the highly fragmented industry for manufactured water production and treatment equipment and systems against a large number of manufacturers, fabricators and service providers, many of which have greater resources than Aerex.
​
Similar to Aerex, PERC competes in the highly fragmented industry for water treatment and water reuse infrastructure development and management against a large number of companies, many of which have greater resources than PERC.
​
Environmental and Health Regulatory Matters
​
Cayman Islands. With respect to our Cayman Islands operations, we operate our water plants in accordance with Cayman Islands laws and regulations. We are licensed by the WAC to extract seawater from wells and discharge concentrated seawater, which is a byproduct of our desalination process, into deep disposal wells.
​
Our Cayman Islands retail water license and bulk water operating contracts require our potable water to meet the World Health Organization’s Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality and contain less than 200 mg/l of total dissolved solids.
​
The Bahamas and British Virgin Islands. With respect to our Bahamian operations and OC-BVI’s British Virgin Islands operations, we and OC-BVI are required by our water supply contracts to take all reasonable measures to prevent pollution of the environment. We are licensed by the Bahamian government to discharge concentrated seawater, which is a by-product of our desalination process, into deep disposal wells. OC-BVI is licensed by the British Virgin Islands government to discharge concentrated seawater into the sea.
​
At several of our locations, hydrogen sulfide gas is present in the seawater and we are contractually obligated to operate our plants in a manner designed to prevent the emission of airborne gas into the environment.
​
United States. Consistent with other U.S. companies, Aerex and PERC must comply with various federal laws and regulations, such as those administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, as well as state and local laws and regulations.
​
We are not aware of any existing or pending environmental legislation which may negatively affect our operations. Presently, we do not have any outstanding issues with any regulatory authority.
​
Human Capital
​
We are committed to a work environment that is welcoming, inclusive and encouraging. To achieve our plans and goals, it is imperative that we attract and retain top talent. In order to do so, we aim to have a safe and encouraging workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop professionally, supported by strong compensation, benefits, and other incentives. We have historically experienced low employee turnover.
​
As of March 24, 2023, we employed a total of 223 persons, 62 in the Cayman Islands, 140 in the United States, 19 in The Bahamas and two in The Netherlands. We also managed the five employees of OC-BVI in the British Virgin Islands. We have 13 management employees and 45 administrative and clerical employees. The remaining employees are engaged in engineering, purchasing, plant maintenance and operations, pipe laying and repair, leak detection, new customer connections, meter reading and laboratory analysis of water quality. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and none are represented by labor unions. We consider our relationships with our employees to be very good.
​
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a number of significant safety measures based on current guidelines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control for employees who work at our facilities.
