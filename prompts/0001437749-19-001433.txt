Item 1. Business
 
H.B. Fuller Company was founded in 1887 and incorporated as a Minnesota corporation in 1915. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol FUL. As used herein, “H.B. Fuller”, “we”, “us”, “our”, “management” or “company” includes H.B. Fuller and its subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated. Where we refer to 2018, 2017 and 2016 herein, the reference is to our fiscal years ended December 1, 2018, December 2, 2017 and December 3, 2016, respectively.
 
We are a leading worldwide formulator, manufacturer and marketer of adhesives, sealants and other specialty chemical products. Sales operations span 34 countries in North America, Europe, Latin America, the Asia Pacific region, India, the Middle East and Africa. Industrial adhesives represent our core product offering. Customers use our adhesives products in manufacturing common consumer and industrial goods, including food and beverage containers, disposable diapers, windows, doors, flooring, roofing, appliances, sportswear, footwear, multi-wall bags, water filtration products, insulation, textiles, automobiles, recreational vehicles, buses, trucks and trailers, marine products, solar energy systems, electronics and products for the aerospace and defense industries. Our adhesives help improve the performance of our customers’ products or improve their manufacturing processes. We also provide our customers with technical support and unique solutions designed to address their specific needs. In addition, we have established a variety of product offerings for residential construction markets, such as tile-setting adhesives, grouts, sealants and related products.
 
Recent Acquisitions
 
Adecol
 
On November 1, 2017, we acquired Adecol Industria Quimica, Limitada (“Adecol”), headquartered in Guarulhos, Brazil. Adecol works with customers to develop innovative, high-quality hot melt, reactive and polymer-based adhesive solutions in the packaging, converting and durable assembly markets. The purchase price of $40.3 million was funded through borrowings on our revolving credit facility and existing cash and is reported in our Americas Adhesives operating segment.

The purchase price of $123.5 million was financed through borrowings on our revolving credit facility and is reported in our Americas Adhesives operating segment.
 
Non-U.S. Operations
 
The principal markets, products and methods of distribution outside the United States vary with each of our regional operations, generally maintaining integrated business units that contain dedicated supplier networks, manufacturing, logistics and sales organizations. The vast majority of the products sold within any region are produced within the region, and the respective regions do not import significant amounts of product from other regions. As of December 1, 2018, we had sales offices and manufacturing plants in 21 countries outside the United States and satellite sales offices in another 12 countries.
 
We have detailed Code of Conduct policies that we apply across all of our operations around the world. These policies represent a set of common values that apply to all employees and all of our business dealings. We have adopted policies and processes, and conduct employee training, all of which are intended to ensure compliance with various economic sanctions and export controls, including the regulations of the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). We do not conduct any business in the following countries that are subject to U.S. economic sanctions: Cuba; Iran; North Korea; Syria and the Crimea region of the Ukraine. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for additional disclosures regarding past business conducted in Iran.

Competition
 
Many of our markets are highly competitive. However, we compete effectively due to the quality and breadth of our adhesives, sealants and specialty chemical portfolio and the experience and expertise of our commercial organizations. Within the adhesives and other specialty chemical markets, we believe few suppliers have comparable global reach and corresponding ability to deliver quality and consistency to multinational customers. Our competition is made up generally of two types of companies: (1) similar multinational suppliers and (2) regional or specialty suppliers that typically compete in only one region or within a narrow geographic area within a region. The multinational competitors typically maintain a broad product offering and range of technology, while regional or specialty companies tend to have limited or more focused product ranges and technology.
 
Principal competitive factors in the sale of adhesives and other specialty chemicals are product performance, supply assurance, technical service, quality, price and customer service.
 
Customers
 
We have cultivated strong, integrated relationships with a diverse set of customers worldwide. Our customers are among the technology and market leaders in consumer goods, construction, and industrial markets. We pride ourselves on long-term, collaborative customer relationships and a diverse portfolio of customers in which no single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated net revenue.
 
Our leading customers include manufacturers of food and beverages, hygiene products, clothing, major appliances, electronics, automobiles, aerospace and defense products, solar energy systems, filters, construction materials, wood flooring, furniture, cabinetry, windows, doors, tissue and towel, corrugation, tube winding, packaging, labels and tapes.
 
Our products are delivered directly to customers primarily from our manufacturing plants, with additional deliveries made through distributors and retailers.
 
Backlog
 
No significant backlog of unfilled orders existed at December 1, 2018 or December 2, 2017.
 
Raw Materials 
 
We use several principal raw materials in our manufacturing processes, including tackifying resins, polymers, synthetic rubbers, vinyl acetate monomer and plasticizers. We generally avoid sole source supplier arrangements for raw materials.
 
The majority of our raw materials are petroleum/natural gas based derivatives. Under normal conditions, raw materials are available on the open market. Prices and availability are subject to supply and demand market mechanisms. Raw material costs are primarily determined by the balance of supply against the aggregate demand from the adhesives industry and other industries that use the same raw material streams. The cost of crude oil and natural gas, the primary feedstocks for our raw materials, can also impact the cost of our raw materials.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
Much of the technology we use in our products and manufacturing processes is available in the public domain. For technology not available in the public domain, we rely on trade secrets and patents when appropriate to protect our competitive position. We also license some patented technology from other sources. Our business is not materially dependent upon licenses or similar rights or on any single patent or group of related patents.
 
We enter into agreements with many employees to protect rights to technology and intellectual property. Confidentiality commitments also are routinely obtained from customers, suppliers and others to safeguard proprietary information.

We own numerous trademarks and service marks in various countries. Trademarks, such as H.B. Fuller®, Swift®, Advantra®, Clarity®, Sesame®, TEC®, Foster®, Rakoll®, Rapidex®, Full-CareTM, Thermonex®, Silaprene®, Eternabond®, Cilbond®, and TONSAN® are important in marketing products. Many of our trademarks and service marks are registered. U.S. trademark registrations are for a term of ten years and are renewable every ten years as long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade.
 
Research and Development
 
Our investment in research and development creates new and innovative adhesive technology platforms, enhances product performance, ensures a competitive cost structure and leverages available raw materials. New product development is a key research and development outcome, providing higher-value solutions to existing customers or meeting new customers’ needs. Projects are developed in local laboratories in each region, where we understand our customer base the best. Platform developments are coordinated globally through our network of laboratories.
 
Through designing and developing new polymers and new formulations, we expect to continue to grow in our current markets. We also develop new applications for existing products and technologies, and improve manufacturing processes to enhance productivity and product quality. Research and development efforts are closely aligned to customer needs, but we do not engage in customer sponsored activities. We foster open innovation, seek supplier-driven new technology and use relationships with academic and other institutions to enhance our capabilities.
 
Environmental, Health and Safety
 
We comply with applicable regulations relating to environmental protection and workers' safety. This includes regular review of and upgrades to environmental, health and safety policies, practices and procedures as well as improved production methods to minimize our facilities’ outgoing waste, based on evolving societal standards and increased environmental understanding.
 
Expenditures to comply with environmental regulations over the next two years are estimated to be approximately $13.8 million, including approximately $1.4 million of capital expenditures. See additional disclosure under Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
 
Seasonality
 
Our operating segments have historically had lower net revenue in winter months, which is primarily our first fiscal quarter, mainly due to international holidays and the seasonal decline in construction and consumer spending activities.
Employees
 
We employed approximately 6,500 individuals on December 1, 2018, of which approximately 2,700 were located in the United States.
