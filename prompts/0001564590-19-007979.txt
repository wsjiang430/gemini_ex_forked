Although C&M is a distributor of Terex rough terrain and truck cranes, C&M’s primary business is the distribution of products manufactured by the Company.  
 
Consolidated Variable Interest Entity
 Even though it had no ownership interest in SVW Crane & Equipment Company (together with its wholly owned subsidiary, Rental Consulting Service Company, “SVW”), the Company previously had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact SVW’s economic performance. Additionally, the Company was the primary beneficiary of the SVW relationship. SVW obtained third party financing, which was effectively guaranteed by the Company, on specific cranes the Company manufactured and remitted the loan proceeds to the Company. Other than its business transactions described herein, SVW had no other substantial business operations. The Company determined that SVW was a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) that under current accounting guidance needed to be consolidated in the Company’s financial results. SVW was consolidated into the Company’s financial results beginning in the first quarter of 2016 through the fourth quarter of 2017. By December 31, 2017, SVW had ceased operations and is therefore not a consolidated VIE after December 31, 2017.

INFORMATION ABOUT OUR BUSINESS 
 Boom Trucks
 A boom truck is a straight telescopic boom crane outfitted with a hook and winch which is mounted on a standard flatbed commercial (Class 7 or 8) truck chassis. Relative to other lifting equipment, boom trucks provide increased versatility and are capable of transporting relatively large payloads from site to site at highway speeds. A boom truck is usually sold with outriggers, pads and devices for reinforcing the chassis in order to improve safety and stability. Although produced in a wide range of models and sizes, boom trucks can be broadly distinguished by their normal lifting capability as light, medium, and heavy-cranes. Various models of medium or heavy-lift boom trucks can safely lift loads from 15 to 80 tons and operating radii can exceed 200 feet. Another advantage of the boom truck is the ability to provide occasional man lift capabilities at a very low cost to height ratio. While it is not uncommon to see a very old boom truck, most replacement cycles seem to trend to seven years. The market for boom trucks has historically been cyclical. 
 Although the Company offers a complete line of boom trucks from light to heavy capacity cranes much of our efforts have been devoted to the development of higher capacity boom trucks specifically designed to meet the particular needs of customers including those in energy production and electrical power distribution. We believe it is an advantage to be skewed towards the heavier lifting capacity, since the heavier capacity cranes have somewhat higher margins. 
 Markets that drive demand for boom trucks include power distribution, oil and gas recovery, infrastructure and new home, commercial and industrial construction.  Historically, the new home construction market, which uses lower capacity cranes, has probably been the most cyclical. Over the past few years, demand from the energy sector has become more cyclical in part due to changes in oil prices. 
 The Company sells its boom trucks through a network of over forty full service dealers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America, and the Middle East. A number of our dealers maintain a rental fleet of their own. Boom trucks can be rented for either short or long-term periods. 
 In 2016, we noted that this selloff of excess equipment continued through much of the year. This selloff dampened demand for new equipment in both the energy market and the other markets we serve with our boom trucks.  We did note that oil prices did begin to increase and by the beginning of June 2016 were approaching $50 per barrel.  Additionally, the oil rig count began to increase again and by year end totaled 525 oil rigs. Late in the year, orders received began to increase and included orders for a number of cranes in a multitude of markets that the Company serves.   
 In 2017, Oil prices remained relatively stable through the first nine months of the year, before the prices began to strengthen considerably during the fourth quarter of the year.  Oil prices at the end of 2017 topped $61 per barrel.  The oil rig count declined during the first half of the year to 431 before rebounding to 658 by the end of 2017.  In early 2018, the oil rig count continued to increase and at the end of March 2018 was over 800.  The sell-off of used equipment continued through most of the year but the effects diminished throughout the year.  The market for boom trucks continued to improve throughout the year but remained below normal levels.  Orders, however, increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2017 and going into 2018 demand for boom trucks continued to increase.
 Entering 2018, the demand for boom trucks continued to be significantly above 2017 levels with industry shipments increasing 19% versus 2017. The general economic environment in the United States during 2018 was favorable. During 2018, the United States economy was strong, oil prices strengthened, and U.S. oil rig count has increased to 1,083 at December 28, 2018 from 929 at December 29, 2017. The Company currently expects the favorable environment that it is currently operating in to continue through 2019.  
 Knuckle Boom Cranes
 PM is a leading Italian manufacturer of truck mounted hydraulic knuckle boom cranes with a 50-year history of technology and innovation, and a product range spanning more than 50 models. Through its consolidated subsidiaries, PM has locations in Modena, Italy; Arad, Romania; Chassieu, France; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; London, UK and Mexico City, Mexico.
 PM knuckle boom cranes are hydraulic folding and articulating cranes, mounted on a commercial chassis, with lifting capacities that range from small (lifting capacity up to three-ton meter) to super heavy (lifting capacity two-hundred-and-ten-ton meter), often supplied with a jib for additional reach. With a compact design and footprint, the crane can be mounted to maximize the load carrying capability of the chassis onto which it is mounted. Combined with the crane’s ability to operate in a compact footprint the ability to carry a payload provides a competitive advantage over other truck mounted cranes and makes the knuckle boom crane particularly attractive for a variety of end uses in the construction and product delivery sectors.

The knuckle boom crane market is a global market with a wide variety of end sector applications, but focused particularly on residential and non-residential construction, road and bridge and infrastructure development. Historically the knuckle boom crane has not had significant application in the energy sector. PM knuckle boom cranes are sold into a variety of geographies including West and East Europe, Central Asia, Africa, North and Central America, South America, the Middle East and the Far East and Pacific region. Historically, PM focused on its domestic and local Western European markets, but in recent years has expanded its sales and distribution efforts internationally. PM has twelve international sales and distribution offices located in several European countries as well as the Far East and Latin America.  After acquisition by Manitex, the Company expanded its distribution capability with the existing Manitex dealer network in North America as well as expanding the number of independent service centers in the US.
 The market for knuckle boom cranes has been growing in recent years as the acceptability of the product has grown and its advantages have been accepted. Growth in North America where the straight mast boom truck crane has been the more dominant product has been more rapid in recent years in combination with the overall improvement in the North American construction sector. PM’s share of the North American market has been historically low; however, this is an area of growth opportunity for the Company following its acquisition by Manitex.
 PM aerial platforms are self-propelled or truck mounted and places an operator in a basket in the air in order to perform maintenance, repairs or similar activities. The equipment is used in a variety of applications including utilities, sign work and industrial maintenance and is often sold to rental operations.
 PM group product serves in a number of geographies in West and East Europe but also the near and Far East and sells through dealers as well as its own sales and distribution offices. The market generally follows the domestic economic cycle for any particular country. Consequently, the market has shown a positive trend in the recent past as European economies recover from the 2009 / 2010 economic crisis.   
 As PM serves a global market, its revenues are affected by changes in economic conditions in markets it serves. In 2016, the middle-east market was soft and had an impact on PM 2016 revenues.  
 In 2017, the demand for knuckle boom cranes was up modestly in all the markets that PM sells into except for the Middle East.  The demand from the Middle East market was consistent with the prior year but remains significantly depressed.  During 2017, Western and North Europe were PM’s largest markets.  Although there was growth in the other PM markets, the demand from such other markets had not returned to earlier levels.  
 During 2018, the demand for knuckle boom cranes was steady in all the markets that PM sells into except for some markets in Latin America where local currency turbulence with strong devaluations towards the Euro and US dollar affected the local demand. The demand from the Middle East market was consistent with 2017 but remained significantly slow. In 2018, demand from Western and Northern Europe, PM’s largest markets, remained at a solid level. Although there was light growth in the other PM markets, the demand from such other markets was still lower than the levels achieved in the past. PM’s markets appear to be stable or growing moving into 2019.
 Industrial Cranes
 Badger sells specialized industrial cranes through a network of dealers. The Badger product line includes specialized 15- and 30-ton industrial cranes (which can be used by the railroads) as well as a 10 ton carry deck crane which are all sold under both the Badger and Manitex names.  Additionally, Badger sells lattice cranes with 20 to 30 ton lifting capacity marketed under the Little Giant trade name.  The Little Giant line has five lattice boom models, three of which are dedicated rail cranes. In addition, Badger also sells a 30-ton truck crane and a 25-ton crawler crane under the Little Giant name.  Badger also has the capability to manufacture certain of our lower capacity boom trucks and provides expanded boom truck manufacturing capacity when needed.
 The products are used by railroads, refineries, states, municipalities, and for general construction.  The Company believes it has an advantage over its competitors in selling to railroads as it is the only crane manufacturer that has integrated the installation of rail gear into its production process. Competitors send their cranes to a third party to have rail gear added which both increases cost and delays deliveries. 
 Valla product line of industrial cranes is a full range of precision pick and carry cranes from 2 to 90 tons, using electric, diesel, and hybrid power options. Its cranes offer wheeled or tracked, and fixed or swing boom configurations, with special applications designed specifically to meet the needs of its customers. The product is sold internationally through dealers and into the rental distribution channel.

Mobile Tanks
 Sabre manufactures a comprehensive line of specialized mobile tanks for liquid and solid storage and containment solutions with capacities from 8,000 to 21,000 gallons. Its mobile tanks are sold to specialized independent tank rental companies and through other direct customers.
 The tanks have historically been used in a variety of end markets such as petrochemical, waste management and oil and gas drilling. However, when we purchased Sabre in 2013, its business heavily skewed towards the energy sector.  Since early 2014, we have been working to diversify the products, customers, and applications.  This includes expanding environmental applications and using our tanks to store deicer fluid at airports. 
 Equipment Distribution 
 C&M is a distributor of the Company’s products as well as Terex’s rough terrain and truck cranes.
 C&M Leasing rents equipment manufactured by the Company as well as a limited amount of equipment manufactured by third parties.  Although C&M is a distributor of Terex rough terrain and truck cranes; C&M’s primary business is the distribution of products manufactured by the Company.  
Part Sales
 As part of our operations, we supply repair and replacement parts for our products. The parts business margins are higher than our overall margins. Part sales as a percentage of revenues tend to increase when there is a down-turn in the industry. Part sales as a percentage of revenues are approximately 12%, 11% and 13% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Total Company Revenues by Sources
 The sources of the Company’s revenues are summarized below:
 
 
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
-----------------------------------------+------+-----+---+------+-----+-----
Boom trucks, knuckle boom & truck cranes | | 73 | % | | 76 | % | 72 | %
Rough terrain cranes | | 3 | % | | 3 | % | 3 | %
Mobile tanks | | 5 | % | | 2 | % | 4 | %
Installation services | | 2 | % | | 2 | % | 3 | %
Other equipment | | 5 | % | | 5 | % | 5 | %
Part sales | | 12 | % | | 12 | % | 13 | %
Total Revenue | | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

 
In 2018 and 2016, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s revenue. In 2017, one customer, Rush Truck Center, accounted for approximately 12.0% of the Company’s revenue. 
 Raw Materials
 The Company purchases a variety of components used in the production of its products.  The Company purchases steel and a variety of machined parts, components and subassemblies including weldments, winches, cylinders, frames, rims, axles, wheels, tires, suspensions, cables, booms and cabs, as well as engines, transmissions and cabs.  Additionally, Manitex and PM mount their cranes on commercial truck chassis, which are either purchased by the Company or supplied by the customer. Lead times for these materials (including chassis) vary from several weeks to many months. The Company is vulnerable to a supply interruption in instances when only one supplier has been qualified and identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers can be very time consuming, and in some cases, could take longer than a year.  The Company has been working on qualifying secondary sources of some products to assure supply consistency and to reduce costs. The degree to which our supply base can respond to changes in market demand directly affects our ability to increase production and the Company attempts to maintain some additional inventory in order to react to unexpected increases in demand. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, raw materials and components were generally available to meet our production schedules and had no significant impact on full year revenues. During the first part of 2018 delivery of chassis for our larger cranes had a modest impact on production, however this was alleviated during the year as manufacturers increased their production and demand also slowed compared to the first half of the year.
 6

Any future supply chain issues that might impact the Company will in part depend on how fast the rate of growth is for a product as well as the rate of growth in the general economy. Strong general economic growth could put us in competition for parts with other industries. Additionally, events or circumstance at a particular supplier could impact the availability of a necessary component.
 Patents and Trademarks
 The Company protects its trade names and trademarks through registration. Its technology consists of bill of materials, drawings, plans, vendor sources and specifications and although the Company’s technology has considerable value, it does not generally have patent protection. The Company has (on rare occasions) filed for patent protection on a specific feature. In the future, the Company will consider seeking patent protection on any new design features believed to present a significant future benefit.
 The Company owns and uses several trademarks relating to its brands that have significant value and are instrumental to the Company’s ability to market its products. The Company’s most significant trademark is “Manitex” (presently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office until 2027).  Badger Equipment Company markets its products under the “Little Giant” and Badger trade names. Sabre markets its products under the “Sabre” tradename. Valla markets its products under the “Valla” tradename. PM sells its products using the trademark “PM” and PM subsidiary, Oil & Steel S.p.A.; sells its products using the “OIL & STEEL” trademark.  The Manitex, Badger, Little Giant, PM and OIL & STEEL trademarks and trade names are important to the marketing and operation of the Company’s business as a significant number of our products are sold under those names.  PM has three patents. One is registered with the Italian Patents and Trademarks Office until 2028.  PM has two additional patents registered with OHIM that are in force until 2031 and 2034, respectively.
 Seasonality
 Traditionally, the Company’s peak selling periods for cranes are the second and third quarters of a calendar year as a result of the need for equipment in the spring, summer and fall construction seasons.  A significant portion of cranes sold over the last several years have been deployed in specialized industries or applications, such as oil and gas production, power distribution and in the railroad industry. Sales in these markets are subject to significant fluctuations which correlate more with general economic conditions and the prices of commodities, including oil, and generally are not of a seasonal nature. 
 Sales of cranes from the Equipment Distribution division mirror the seasonality of the overall Company. However, the sale of parts is much less seasonal given the geographic breadth of the customer base. Crane repairs are performed by the Equipment Distribution division throughout the year but are somewhat affected by the slowdown in construction activity during the typically harsh winters in the Midwestern United States.
 Competition
 Lifting Equipment
 The market for the Company’s boom trucks and knuckle boom cranes, industrial cranes and trailers is highly competitive. The Company competes based on product design, quality of products and services, product performance, maintenance costs and price. Several competitors have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and distribution resources than we do. The Company believes that it effectively competes with its competitors.
 The Company’s boom cranes compete with cranes manufactured by National Crane, Terex, Weldco Beales, Elliott and Altec. The Company’s knuckle boom cranes compete with Palfinger, Fassi, Effer and HIAB. The Company competes primarily with Terex and Broderson in selling rough terrain and industrial cranes.  The Company’s mobile tanks compete with tanks sold by Dragon Tank and Pinnacle Mfg., LLC.
 Equipment Distribution
 The Equipment Distribution division’s primary business is facilitation of sale of products manufactured by the Company. As such, it faces the same competition described above for products manufactured by the Company.  Additionally, the Equipment Distribution division has a dealership arrangement with Terex and must compete against dealers of other rough terrain and truck crane manufacturers.  Locally, the Equipment Distribution division competes against Runnion Equipment (dealer for National Crane), Power Equipment Leasing (dealer for Elliott) and Guiffre Cranes (dealer for Manitex and Terex boom trucks). Runnion is also authorized to sell Manitex boom trucks. 
 7

While no geographic limitations exist regarding the Equipment Distribution business’s ability to sell cranes internationally, the lack of any barriers to entry and the heavy use of the Internet make this a highly active and competitive market in which to distribute cranes.
 Competition for our Equipment Distribution repair business is even more intense since it is limited geographically due to the necessity of having physical access to the cranes. Most of the above referenced companies also compete in this aspect of the business, as do other types of crane and equipment dealers from nearby areas such as Indiana or Wisconsin.
 Equipment Distribution parts sales are global in scope and benefit greatly from the Internet and the tenure and expertise of our employees. While competition in this area is extensive, we believe that the breadth of the products offered and our long history in this part of the business is a competitive advantage.
 Our Equipment Distribution business competes based on the design, quality and performance of the products it distributes, price and the supporting repair and part services that it provides. Several competitors have greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. The Company, however, believes that it effectively competes with its competitors.
 Backlog
 The backlog at December 31, 2018 was approximately $66.7 million, compared to a backlog of approximately $61.5 million at December 31, 2017.  The December 31, 2018 backlog has increased by $5.2 million since September 30, 2018 when it was at $60.5 million.  The backlog has continued to grow during the early part of 2019 and was $80.2 million at February 28, 2019.   The Company expects to ship product to fulfill its existing backlog within the next twelve months.
