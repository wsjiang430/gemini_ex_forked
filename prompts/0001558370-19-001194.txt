     Item 1. Business
     Introduction
     First Busey Corporation (“First Busey” or the “Company”), a Nevada Corporation, initially organized in 1980, is a $7.7 billion financial holding company.  First Busey conducts a broad range of financial services through its one wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Busey Bank, with banking centers in Illinois, Missouri, Florida and Indiana. First Busey is headquartered in Champaign, Illinois, and its common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “BUSE.”     Acquisitions
     On January 8, 2015, First Busey acquired Herget Financial Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Herget Financial”), and its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Herget Bank, National Association (“Herget Bank”).  First Busey operated Herget Bank as a separate banking subsidiary from January 9, 2015 until March 13, 2015, when it was merged with and into Busey Bank.  At that time, Herget Bank’s banking centers became banking centers of Busey Bank.
     On April 30, 2016, First Busey acquired Pulaski Financial Corp., a Missouri corporation (“Pulaski”), and its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Pulaski Bank, National Association (“Pulaski Bank”).  First Busey operated Pulaski Bank as a separate bank subsidiary from May 1, 2016 until November 4, 2016, when it was merged with and into Busey Bank.  At that time, Pulaski Bank’s banking centers became banking centers of Busey Bank.  The acquisition of Pulaski expanded the Company into the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area.
     On July 2, 2017, First Busey acquired First Community Financial Partners, Inc., an Illinois corporation (“First Community”), and its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, First Community Financial Bank.  First Busey operated First Community Financial Bank as a separate bank subsidiary from July 3, 2017 until November 3, 2017, when it was merged with and into Busey Bank.  At that time, First Community Financial Bank’s banking centers became banking centers of Busey Bank. The First Community acquisition provided the Company entrance into the southwest suburban markets of the greater Chicagoland area.
     On October 1, 2017, First Busey acquired Mid Illinois Bancorp, Inc., an Illinois corporation (“Mid Illinois”) and its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, South Side Trust & Savings Bank of Peoria (“South Side Bank”).  First Busey operated South Side Bank as a separate bank subsidiary from October 2, 2017 until March 16, 2018, when it was merged with and into Busey Bank.  At that time, South Side Bank’s banking centers became banking centers of Busey Bank.
     On August 21, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with The Banc Ed Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Banc Ed”), pursuant to which Banc Ed would merge into First Busey, with First Busey as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”).  TheBANK of Edwardsville, Banc Ed’s wholly-owned bank subsidiary (“TheBANK”), will be merged with and into First Busey’s bank subsidiary, Busey Bank, at a date following the completion of the holding company merger. At the time of the bank merger, TheBANK’s banking offices will become branches of Busey Bank.  This partnership will enhance First Busey’s existing deposit, commercial banking and wealth management presence in the greater St. Louis Missouri-Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area.  The holding company merger was completed on January 31, 2019 and is identified as a “subsequent event” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The operating results of Banc Ed are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. 
     See “Note 2. Acquisitions” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information relating to these acquisitions.
     Subsidiaries of First Busey
     First Busey conducts the business of banking, related banking services, asset management, brokerage and fiduciary services through Busey Bank and retail payment processing through FirsTech, Inc. (“FirsTech”).
     Busey Bank is an Illinois state-chartered bank organized in 1868 with its headquarters in Champaign, Illinois.  Busey Bank has 44 banking centers in Illinois, 13 in Missouri, five in southwest Florida and one in Indianapolis, Indiana.

 Busey Bank offers a range of diversified financial products and services for consumers and businesses, including online and mobile banking capabilities to conveniently serve our customers’ needs.  Commercial services include commercial, commercial real estate, real estate construction and agricultural loans as well as commercial depository services including cash management. Retail banking services include residential real estate, home equity lines of credit and consumer loans, customary types of demand and savings deposits, money transfers, safe deposit services, and IRA and other fiduciary services through our banking center, ATM and technology-based networks.  In addition Busey Bank provides professional farm management and brokerage services to the agricultural industry. 
     Busey Trust Company, formerly a subsidiary of Busey Wealth Management Inc., was merged into Busey Bank in the fourth quarter of 2018 and Busey Wealth Management, Inc. was subsequently dissolved. As a result, Busey Bank now directly provides asset management, investment and fiduciary services to individuals, businesses and foundations.  As of December 31, 2018, $7.1 billion of assets were under care.  For individuals, Busey Bank provides investment management, trust and estate advisory services and financial planning.  For businesses, it provides investment management, business succession planning and employee retirement plan services.  For foundations, Busey Bank provides investment management, investment strategy consulting and fiduciary services.  Brokerage related services are offered by Busey Investment Services, a division of Busey Bank through a third-party arrangement with Raymond James Financial Services.
     Busey Bank’s principal sources of income are interest and fees on loans and investments, trust fees and service fees.  Principal expenses are interest paid on deposits and general operating expenses.  Busey Bank’s primary markets are Illinois, the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area, southwest Florida, and central Indiana.
     Busey Bank’s subsidiary, FirsTech, which has offices in Decatur, Illinois and Clayton, Missouri, offers pay processing solutions including: walk-in payment processing for payments delivered by customers to retail pay agents; online bill payment solutions for payments made by customers on a billing company’s website; customer service payments for payments accepted over the telephone; mobile bill pay; direct debit services; electronic concentration of payments delivered by the Automated Clearing House network; money management software and credit card networks; and lockbox remittance processing of payments delivered by mail. As of December 31, 2018, FirsTech had approximately 4,000 agent locations in 43 states.
     First Busey Corporation also has various other subsidiaries that are not significant to the consolidated entity.
     The Company’s operations are managed through three operating segments consisting of Banking, Remittance Processing and Wealth Management.  See “Note 22. Operating Segments and Related Information” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for an analysis of segment operations.
     Economic Conditions of Markets
     The Company has 44 banking centers serving Illinois.  Our Illinois markets of Champaign, Macon, McLean, and Peoria counties and Southwest Chicago feature several Fortune 1000 companies.  Those organizations, coupled with large healthcare and higher education sectors, anchor the communities in which they are located, and have provided a comparatively stable foundation for housing, employment and small business.  
     The State of Illinois, where a large portion of the Company’s customer base is located, continues to be troubled with pension under-funding, continued budget deficits and a declining credit outlook.  Any possible payment lapses by the State of Illinois to its vendors and government sponsored entities may have negative effects on our primary market areas.
     Busey Bank has 13 banking centers serving the St. Louis metropolitan area, all of which are located in the city of St. Louis, or the adjacent counties of St. Louis County and St. Charles County.  The bi-state metropolitan area includes seven counties in Missouri and eight counties in Illinois; therefore, the Company’s geographic concentration in only three of these 15 counties gives the Company expansion opportunities into neighboring counties.  St. Louis has a diverse economy with major employment sectors including health care, financial services, professional and business services, and retail.  St. Charles County has been one of the fastest-growing counties in the country for decades.
     Busey Bank has five banking centers in southwest Florida which has experienced job growth and an expanded housing market over the last several years.
     Busey Bank has one banking center in the Indianapolis, Indiana area, which is the most populous city of Indiana with a diverse economy, including the headquarters of many large corporations.

 Competition
     Busey Bank competes actively with national and state banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions for deposits and loans mainly in Illinois, the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area, southwest Florida, and central Indiana.  Busey Bank competes for real estate and other loans primarily on the basis of type of loan, interest rates and loan fees and the quality of services provided. Busey Bank and FirsTech compete with other financial institutions, including asset management and trust companies, security broker/dealers, personal loan companies, insurance companies, finance companies, leasing companies, mortgage companies, remittance processing companies, and certain governmental agencies, all of which actively engage in marketing various types of loans, deposit accounts, wealth management and other products and services.  
     The Bank faces substantial competition in attracting deposits from other commercial banks, savings institutions, money market and mutual funds, credit unions, insurance agencies, brokerage firms, and other investment vehicles.  Customers for banking services are generally influenced by convenience, quality of service, personal contacts, price of services and availability of products.  The Bank attracts a significant amount of deposits through their banking centers, primarily from the communities in which those banking centers are located; therefore, competition for those deposits is principally from other commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions located in the same communities.  The Bank competes for these deposits by offering a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates, high-quality customer service, convenient business hours, internet and mobile banking, and convenient banking centers with interbranch deposit and withdrawal privileges.
     Based on information obtained from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) Summary of Deposits dated June 30, 2018, Busey Bank ranked in the top ten in total deposits in ten Illinois counties: first in Champaign County; fifth in Ford County; sixth in Grundy County; seventh in Livingston County; second in Macon County; fifth in McLean County; second in Peoria County; second in Shelby County; third in Tazewell County; and seventh in Will County.  In addition, Busey Bank was ranked tenth in St. Louis County in Missouri. First Busey believes that it effectively competes with other banks, thrifts and financial institutions in these market areas.
     Supervision, Regulation and Other Factors
     General
     At December 31, 2018, First Busey had one wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Busey Bank.  On January 31, 2019, First Busey completed its acquisition of Banc Ed, and its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, TheBANK.  The operating results of Banc Ed are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included herein and the acquisition is identified as a “subsequent event” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
     FDIC-insured institutions, like Busey Bank and TheBANK (both of which are sometimes collectively referred to in this section as the “Banks”), as well as their holding companies and their affiliates, are extensively regulated under federal and state law.  As a result, the Company’s growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (the “DFPR”), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).  Furthermore, taxation laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), securities laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and state securities authorities, and anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) have an impact on the Company’s business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and accounting rules are significant to the Company’s operations and results.
     Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than stockholders. These laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of the Company’s business, the kinds and amounts of investments the Company and the Banks may make, reserve requirements, required capital levels relative to assets, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and acquire, dealings with the Company’s and the Banks’ insiders and affiliates and the Company’s payment of dividends.  In reaction to the global financial crisis and particularly following the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny. Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence filtered down in varying degrees to community banks over time and caused the Company’s compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase. Moreover, as of December 31, 2018, the Company was approaching a size threshold ($10 billion in assets) at which point prescribed prudential standards would be significantly enhanced. After the 2016 federal elections, momentum to decrease the regulatory burden on all but the largest banks gathered strength. In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”) was enacted to provide meaningful relief for community banks and their holding companies (those with less 

 
  6

 
than $10 billion in assets) and on larger institutions that had been categorized as systemically important solely because of size (those with assets between $50 billion and $250 billion). Because the Company is approaching the $10 billion threshold, it will not benefit from all of the changes effected for community banks; however, the Regulatory Relief Act relieves it from certain prudential requirements, including mandatory annual company-run stress tests that would otherwise have become applicable when it exceeded $10 billion in assets. The Company believes that such reforms are favorable to its operations.
     The supervisory framework for U.S. banking organizations subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that are not publicly available and that can impact the conduct and growth of their business. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations.
     The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to the Company and the Banks, beginning with a discussion of the continuing regulatory emphasis on the Company’s capital levels. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision.
     The Role of Capital
     Regulatory capital represents the net assets of a banking organization available to absorb losses. Because of the risks attendant to their business, FDIC-insured institutions are generally required to hold more capital than other businesses, which directly affects the Company’s earnings capabilities. While capital has historically been one of the key measures of the financial health of both bank holding companies and banks, its role became fundamentally more important in the wake of the global financial crisis, as the banking regulators recognized that the amount and quality of capital held by banks prior to the crisis was insufficient to absorb losses during periods of severe stress. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, discussed below, establish capital standards for banks and bank holding companies that are meaningfully more stringent than those in place previously.     Minimum Required Capital Levels
     Banks have been required to hold minimum levels of capital based on guidelines established by the bank regulatory agencies since 1983. The minimums have been expressed in terms of ratios of “capital” divided by “total assets.” As discussed below, bank capital measures have become more sophisticated over the years and have focused more on the quality of capital and the risk of assets.  Bank holding companies have historically had to comply with less stringent capital standards than their bank subsidiaries and have been able to raise capital with hybrid instruments such as trust preferred securities. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated the Federal Reserve to establish minimum capital levels for holding companies on a consolidated basis as stringent as those required for FDIC-insured institutions.  A result of this change is that the proceeds of hybrid instruments, such as trust preferred securities, were excluded from capital over a phase-out period. However, if such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank holding companies with less than $15 billion of assets, they may be retained, subject to certain restrictions. Because the Company has assets of less than $15 billion, the Company is able to maintain its trust preferred proceeds as capital but the Company has to comply with new capital mandates in other respects and will not be able to raise capital in the future through the issuance of trust preferred securities.     The Basel International Capital Accords
     The risk-based capital guidelines for U.S. banks since 1989 were based upon the 1988 capital accord known as “Basel I” adopted by the international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central banks and bank supervisors that acts as the primary global standard-setter for prudential regulation, as implemented by the U.S. bank regulatory agencies on an interagency basis. The accord recognized that bank assets for the purpose of the capital ratio calculations needed to be assigned risk weights (the theory being that riskier assets should require more capital) and that off-balance sheet exposures needed to be factored in the calculations.  Basel I had a very simple formula for assigning risk weights to bank assets from 0% to 100% based on four categories. In 2008, the banking agencies collaboratively began to phase-in capital standards based on a second capital accord, referred to as “Basel II,” for large or “core” international banks (generally defined for U.S. purposes as having total assets of $250 billion or more, or consolidated foreign exposures of $10 billion or more) known as “advanced approaches” banks.  The primary focus of Basel II was on the calculation of risk weights based on complex models developed by each advanced approaches bank. Because most banks were not subject to Basel II, the U.S. bank regulators worked to improve the risk sensitivity of Basel I standards without imposing the complexities of Basel II. This “standardized approach” increased the number of risk-weight categories and recognized risks well above the original 100% risk weight. It is institutionalized by the Dodd-Frank Act for all banking organizations, even for the advanced approaches banks, as a floor.

 On September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement on a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations around the world, known as Basel III, to address deficiencies recognized in connection with the global financial crisis.   
     The Basel III Rule
     In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in pertinent part, and, at the same time, promulgated rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Rule”).  In contrast to capital requirements historically, which were in the form of guidelines, Basel III was released in the form of enforceable regulations by each of the regulatory agencies. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all banking organizations that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and state banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies, other than “small bank holding companies” (generally holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $3 billion that do not have securities registered with the SEC). Banking organizations became subject to the Basel III Rule on January 1, 2015 and all parts of it were fully phased-in as of January 1, 2019.
     The Basel III Rule increased the required quantity and quality of capital and, for nearly every class of assets, it requires a more complex, detailed and calibrated assessment of risk and calculation of risk-weight amounts. Not only did the Basel III Rule increase most of the required minimum capital ratios in effect prior to January 1, 2015, but it introduced the concept of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, which consists primarily of common stock, related surplus (net of Treasury stock), retained earnings, and Common Equity Tier 1 minority interests subject to certain regulatory adjustments. The Basel III Rule also changed the definition of capital by establishing more stringent criteria that instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (primarily non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock that meets certain requirements) and Tier 2 Capital (primarily other types of preferred stock and subordinated debt, subject to limitations).  A number of instruments that qualified as Tier 1 Capital under Basel I do not qualify, or their qualifications changed. For example, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, which qualified as simple Tier 1 Capital under Basel I, does not qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but qualifies as Additional Tier 1 Capital. The Basel III Rule also constrained the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets in capital and requires deductions from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital in the event that such assets exceed a certain percentage of a banking institution’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.  
     The Basel III Rule required minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015, as follows: 
    
· | A ratio of minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An increase in the minimum required amount of Tier 1 Capital from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A continuation of the minimum required amount of Total Capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) at 8% of risk-weighted assets; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total quarterly average assets equal to 4% in all circumstances.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In addition, institutions that seek the freedom to make capital distributions (including for dividends and repurchases of stock) and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction must also maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to a capital conservation buffer (fully phased-in as of January 1, 2019). The purpose of the conservation buffer is to ensure that banking institutions maintain a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses during periods of financial and economic stress. Factoring in the conservation buffer increases the minimum ratios depicted above to 7% for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 8.5% for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5% for Total Capital.  
     Well-Capitalized Requirements
     The ratios described above are minimum standards in order for banking organizations to be considered “adequately capitalized.” Bank regulatory agencies uniformly encourage banks to hold more capital and be “well-capitalized” and, to that end, federal law and regulations provide various incentives for banking organizations to maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. For example, a banking organization that is well-capitalized may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications; and (iii) accept, roll-over or renew brokered deposits. Higher capital levels could also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. For example, the Federal Reserve’s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. Further, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions (i.e., Tier 1 Capital less all intangible assets), well above the minimum levels.

 Under the capital regulations of the FDIC and Federal Reserve, in order to be well‑capitalized, a banking organization must maintain:
    
· | A Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio to risk-weighted assets of 6.5% or more;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8% or more (6% under Basel I);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A ratio of Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 10% or more (the same as Basel I); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total adjusted average quarterly assets of 5% or greater.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      It is possible under the Basel III Rule to be well-capitalized while remaining out of compliance with the capital conservation buffer discussed above.
     As of December 31, 2018: (i) neither Busey Bank nor TheBANK was subject to a directive from the FDIC to increase its capital and (ii) the Banks were well-capitalized, as defined by FDIC regulations. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had regulatory capital in excess of the Federal Reserve’s requirements and met the Basel III Rule requirements to be well-capitalized.
     Prompt Corrective Action
     The concept of an institution being “well-capitalized” is part of a regulatory enforcement regime that provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take “prompt corrective action” to resolve the problems of institutions based on the capital level of each particular institution. The extent of the regulators’ powers depends on whether the institution in question is “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized,” in each case as defined by regulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators’ corrective powers include: (i) requiring the institution to submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) limiting the institution’s asset growth and restricting its activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to sell itself; (iv) restricting transactions between the institution and its affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate that the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution.
     Regulation and Supervision of the Company
     General
     The Company, as the sole stockholder of the Banks, is a bank holding company. As a bank holding company, the Company is registered with, and subject to regulation by, the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”). The Company is legally obligated to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of the Banks and to commit resources to support them in circumstances where we might not otherwise do so. Under the BHCA, the Company is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve and is required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports of its operations and such additional information regarding the Company and each of the Banks as the Federal Reserve may require. 
     Acquisitions, Activities and Financial Holding Company Election        The primary purpose of a bank holding company is to control and manage banks. The BHCA generally requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for any merger involving a bank holding company or any acquisition by a bank holding company of another bank or bank holding company. Subject to certain conditions (including deposit concentration limits established by the BHCA), the Federal Reserve may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States. In approving interstate acquisitions, the Federal Reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its FDIC-insured institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state institutions or their holding companies) and state laws that require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company. Furthermore, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to effect interstate mergers or acquisitions. For a discussion of the capital requirements, see “—The Role of Capital” above.
     The BHCA generally prohibits the Company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries. This general prohibition is subject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in, and to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve prior to November 11, 1999 to be “so closely related to banking ... as to be a proper incident thereto.” This authority permits the Company to engage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including the ownership and operation of a 

 
  9

 
savings association, or any entity engaged in consumer finance, equipment leasing, the operation of a computer service bureau (including software development) and mortgage banking and brokerage services. The BHCA does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies. 
     Additionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the BHCA and elect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities, including securities and insurance underwriting and sales, merchant banking and any other activity that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines by regulation or order is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the Federal Reserve determines by order to be complementary to any such financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of FDIC-insured institutions or the financial system generally. The Company has elected to operate as a financial holding company. In order to maintain its status as a financial holding company, the Company and each of the Banks must be well-capitalized, well-managed, and the Banks must have a least a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) rating.  If the Federal Reserve determines that a financial holding company is not well-capitalized or well-managed, the company has a period of time in which to achieve compliance, but during the period of noncompliance, the Federal Reserve may place any limitations on the company it believes to be appropriate. Furthermore, if the Federal Reserve determines that a financial holding company’s subsidiary bank has not received a satisfactory CRA rating, that company will not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities.
     Change in Control        Federal law also prohibits any person or company from acquiring “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator. “Control” is conclusively presumed to exist upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, but may arise under certain circumstances between 10% and 24.99% ownership.
     Capital Requirements 
     Bank holding companies are required to maintain capital in accordance with Federal Reserve capital adequacy requirements. For a discussion of capital requirements, see “—The Role of Capital” above.     Dividend Payments
     The Company’s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders may be affected by both general corporate law considerations and the policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies. As a Nevada corporation, the Company is subject to the limitations of Nevada law, which allows the Company to pay dividends unless, after such dividend, (i) the Company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or (ii) the Company’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus any amount that would be needed, if the Company were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend payment, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders whose rights are superior to the rights of the stockholders receiving the distribution.  
     As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends to stockholders if: (i) the company’s net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. The Federal Reserve also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies.  In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer.

     There have been a number of developments in recent years focused on incentive compensation plans sponsored by bank holding companies and banks, reflecting recognition by the bank regulatory agencies and Congress that flawed incentive compensation practices in the financial industry were one of many factors contributing to the global financial crisis. Layered on top of that were the abuses in the headlines dealing with product cross-selling incentive plans. The result is interagency guidance on sound incentive compensation practices. 
    
 
  10

 

 The interagency guidance recognized three core principles. Effective incentive plans should: (i) provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward; (ii) be compatible with effective controls and risk-management; and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. Much of the guidance addresses large banking organizations and, because of the size and complexity of their operations, the regulators expect those organizations to maintain systematic and formalized policies, procedures, and systems for ensuring that the incentive compensation arrangements for all executive and non-executive employees covered by this guidance are identified and reviewed, and appropriately balance risks and rewards.  Smaller banking organizations like the Company that use incentive compensation arrangements are expected to be less extensive, formalized, and detailed than those of the larger banks.  
     Monetary Policy 
     The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has a significant effect on the operating results of financial or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the tools available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market transactions in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.     Federal Securities Regulation 
     The Company’s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Consequently, the Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act.
     Corporate Governance        The Dodd-Frank Act addressed many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments, and authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate and solicit voters for their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of bank holding companies, regardless of whether such companies are publicly traded.
     Regulation and Supervision of the Banks
     General
     Both of the Banks are Illinois-chartered banks. Their deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) to the maximum extent provided under federal law and FDIC regulations, currently $250,000 per insured depositor category. As Illinois-chartered FDIC-insured banks, the Banks are subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the DFPR, the chartering authority for Illinois banks. The Banks are also regulated by the FDIC, designated by federal law as the primary federal regulator of insured state banks that, like the Banks, are not members of the Federal Reserve System.      Deposit Insurance
     As FDIC-insured institutions, the Banks are required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC.  The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification.  For institutions like the Banks that are not considered large and highly complex banking organizations, assessments are now based on examination ratings and financial ratios. The total base assessment rates currently range from 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points. At least semi-annually, the FDIC updates its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increases or decreases the assessment rates, following notice and comment on proposed rulemaking. The assessment base against which an FDIC-insured institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the DIF has been calculated since effectiveness of the Dodd-Frank Act based on its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. This method shifted the burden of deposit insurance premiums toward those large depository institutions that rely on funding sources other than U.S. deposits.  
     The reserve ratio is the FDIC insurance fund balance divided by estimated insured deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act altered the minimum reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to FDIC-insured institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.  The reserve ratio reached 1.36% as of September 30, 2018 (most recent available), exceeding the statutory required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35%. The FDIC will provide assessment credits to insured depository institutions, like the Banks, with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion for the portion of their regular assessments that contribute to growth in the reserve 

 
  11

 
ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. The FDIC will apply the credits each quarter that the reserve ratio is at least 1.38% to offset the regular deposit insurance assessments of institutions with credits.
     FICO Assessments
     In addition to paying basic deposit insurance assessments, FDIC-insured institutions must pay Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) assessments. FICO is a mixed-ownership governmental corporation chartered by the former Federal Home Loan Bank Board pursuant to the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 to function as a financing vehicle for the recapitalization of the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. FICO issued 30-year noncallable bonds of approximately $8.1 billion that mature through 2019. FICO’s authority to issue bonds ended on December 12, 1991. Since 1996, federal legislation has required that all FDIC-insured institutions pay assessments to cover interest payments on FICO’s outstanding obligations. The FICO assessment rate is adjusted quarterly and for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 32 cents per $100 dollars of assessable deposits.
     Supervisory Assessments        All Illinois-chartered banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the DFPR to fund the operations of that agency. The amount of the assessment is calculated on the basis of each bank’s total assets. 
     Capital Requirements 
     Banks are generally required to maintain capital levels in excess of other businesses. For a discussion of capital requirements, see “—The Role of Capital” above.
     Liquidity Requirements        Liquidity is a measure of the ability and ease with which bank assets may be converted to cash. Liquid assets are those that can be converted to cash quickly if needed to meet financial obligations. To remain viable, FDIC-insured institutions must have enough liquid assets to meet their near-term obligations, such as withdrawals by depositors. Because the global financial crisis was in part a liquidity crisis, Basel III also includes a liquidity framework that requires FDIC-insured institutions to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests. One test, referred to as the LCR, is designed to ensure that the banking entity has an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets that can be converted easily and immediately in private markets into cash to meet liquidity needs for a 30-calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The other test, known as the NSFR, is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of FDIC-insured institutions over a one-year horizon. These tests provide an incentive for banks and holding companies to increase their holdings in Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets, increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source and rely on stable funding like core deposits (in lieu of brokered deposits).
     In addition to liquidity guidelines already in place, the federal bank regulatory agencies implemented the Basel III LCR in September 2014, which requires large financial firms to hold levels of liquid assets sufficient to protect against constraints on their funding during times of financial turmoil, and in 2016 proposed implementation of the NSFR. While these rules do not, and will not, apply to the Banks, the Company continues to review its liquidity risk management policies in light of developments.
     Dividend Payments
     The primary source of funds for the Company is dividends from its subsidiary banks. Under Illinois banking law, Illinois-chartered banks generally may pay dividends only out of undivided profits.  The DFPR may restrict the declaration or payment of a dividend by an Illinois-chartered bank.  The payment of dividends by any FDIC-insured institution is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and a FDIC-insured institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be undercapitalized.  Notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends, the FDIC and the DFPR may prohibit the payment of dividends by the Banks if either or both determine such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends will have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer.
     The ability of the Company to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and to service its debt was historically dependent on the receipt of cash dividends from its subsidiaries.  Under applicable regulatory requirements, an Illinois state-chartered bank such as Busey Bank may not pay dividends in excess of its net profits.  Because Busey Bank had been in an accumulated deficit position since 2009, it was not able to pay dividends.  With prior approval from its regulators, however, an Illinois state-chartered bank in that situation was able to reduce its capital stock by amending its charter to decrease the authorized number of shares, and then make a subsequent distribution to its holding company.  Using this approach, and with the approval of its regulators, Busey Bank has distributed funds to 

 
  12

 
the Company, the most recent of which was $40.0 million on October 12, 2018.  Busey Bank returned to positive retained earnings in the second quarter of 2018.  The Company expects Busey Bank to return to paying dividends from net profits in future periods.
     State Bank Investments and Activities        The Banks are permitted to make investments and engage in activities directly or through subsidiaries as authorized by Illinois law. However, under federal law and FDIC regulations, FDIC-insured state banks are prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from making or retaining equity investments of a type, or in an amount, that are not permissible for a national bank. Federal law and FDIC regulations also prohibit FDIC-insured state banks and their subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, from engaging as principal in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank unless the bank meets, and continues to meet, its minimum regulatory capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity would not pose a significant risk to the DIF. These restrictions have not had, and are not currently expected to have, a material impact on the operations of the Banks.
     Insider Transactions        The Banks are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on “covered transactions” between the Banks and their “affiliates.” The Company is an affiliate of the Banks for purposes of these restrictions, and covered transactions subject to the restrictions include extensions of credit to the Company, investments in the stock or other securities of the Company and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of the Company as collateral for loans made by the Banks. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.
     Certain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by the Banks to their directors and officers, to directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, to principal stockholders of the Company and to “related interests” of such directors, officers and principal stockholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person who is a director or officer of the Company or the Banks, or a principal stockholder of the Company, may obtain credit from banks with which the Banks maintain a correspondent relationship.
     Safety and Soundness Standards/Risk Management        The federal banking agencies have adopted operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of FDIC-insured institutions. The standards apply to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings.
     In general, the safety and soundness standards prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals.  While regulatory standards do not have the force of law, if an institution operates in an unsafe and unsound manner, the FDIC-insured institution’s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance. If an FDIC-insured institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal regulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency. Until the deficiency cited in the regulator’s order is cured, the regulator may restrict the FDIC-insured institution’s rate of growth, require the FDIC-insured institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances. Noncompliance with safety and soundness may also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal bank regulatory agencies, including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments.
     During the past decade, the bank regulatory agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of sound risk management processes and strong internal controls when evaluating the activities of the FDIC-insured institutions they supervise. Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of financial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets. The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, and reputational risk. In particular, recent regulatory pronouncements have focused on operational risk, which arises from the potential that inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses. New products and services, third-party risk and cybersecurity are critical sources of operational risk that FDIC-insured institutions are expected to address in the current environment. The Banks are expected to have active board and senior management oversight; adequate policies, procedures, and limits; adequate risk measurement, monitoring, and management information systems; and comprehensive internal controls.

 Branching Authority
     Illinois banks, such as the Banks, have the authority under Illinois law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Illinois, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals.  The Dodd-Frank Act permits well-capitalized and well-managed banks to establish new interstate branches or acquire individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) without impediments. Federal law permits state and national banks to merge with banks in other states subject to: (i) regulatory approval; (ii) federal and state deposit concentration limits; and (iii) state law limitations requiring the merging bank to have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) prior to the merger.  The Company expects to merge TheBANK with and into Busey Bank in the second half of 2019. 
     Transaction Account Reserves        Federal Reserve regulations require FDIC-insured institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). For 2019, the first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempt from reserves and have a zero percent reserve requirement; for transaction accounts aggregating between $16.3 million to $124.2 million, the reserve requirement is 3% of those transaction account balances; and for net transaction accounts in excess of $124.2 million, the reserve requirement is 10% of the aggregate amount of total transaction account balances in excess of $124.2 million. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve.
     Community Reinvestment Act Requirements
     The CRA requires each of the Banks to have a continuing and affirmative obligation in a safe and sound manner to help meet the credit needs of the entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Federal regulators regularly assess the Banks’ records of meeting the credit needs of its communities. Applications for additional acquisitions would be affected by the evaluation of each of the Bank’s effectiveness in meeting their CRA requirements.
     Anti-Money Laundering 
     The USA Patriot Act is designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the U.S. financial system and has significant implications for FDIC-insured institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The USA Patriot Act mandates financial services companies to have policies and procedures with respect to measures designed to address any or all of the following matters: (i) customer identification programs; (ii) money laundering; (iii) terrorist financing; (iv) identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions; (v) currency crimes; and (vi) cooperation between FDIC-insured institutions and law enforcement authorities. 
     Privacy and Cybersecurity 
     The Banks are subject to many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and procedures to protect non-public confidential information of their customers. These laws require the Banks to periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and permit consumers to opt out of their ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. They also impact the Banks’ ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. In addition, the Banks are required to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. These security and privacy policies and procedures, for the protection of personal and confidential information, are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations.     Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate 
     Concentration risk exists when FDIC-insured institutions deploy too many assets to any one industry or segment. A concentration in commercial real estate is one example of regulatory concern. The interagency Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices guidance (“CRE Guidance”) provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) commercial real estate loans exceeding 300% of capital and increasing 50% or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100% of capital. The CRE Guidance does not limit banks’ levels of commercial real estate lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies issued a statement to reinforce prudent risk-management practices related to CRE lending, having observed substantial growth in many CRE asset and lending markets, increased competitive pressures, rising CRE concentrations in banks, and an easing of CRE underwriting standards. The federal bank agencies reminded FDIC-insured institutions to maintain 

 
  14

 
underwriting discipline and exercise prudent risk-management practices to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the risks arising from CRE lending. In addition, FDIC-insured institutions must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentration risk. As of December 31, 2018, Busey Bank did not exceed these guidelines.
     Consumer Financial Services        The historical structure of federal consumer protection regulation applicable to all providers of consumer financial products and services changed significantly on July 21, 2011, when the CFPB commenced operations to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all providers of consumer products and services, including the Banks, as well as the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over providers with more than $10 billion in assets, and that will include Busey Bank when its assets exceed that amount. In the meantime, as long as the Banks are FDIC-insured institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, they will continue to be examined by the applicable bank regulators. The CFPB’s rules have not had a significant impact on the Banks’ operations, except for higher compliance costs.

     First Busey’s website address is www.busey.com.  We make available on this website our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed or furnished with the SEC, and in any event, on the same day as such filing with the SEC.  Reference to this website does not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the website and should not be considered part of this document.
     First Busey has adopted a code of ethics applicable to our employees, officers, and directors.  The text of this code of ethics may be found under “Investor Relations” on our website.
     Non-GAAP Financial Information
     This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These measures include adjusted net income, adjusted return on average assets, adjusted net interest margin, adjusted efficiency ratio, tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible book value per share and return on average tangible common equity. Management uses these non-GAAP measures, together with the related GAAP measures, to analyze the Company’s performance and to make business decisions. Management also uses these measures for peer comparisons.
     A reconciliation to what management believes to be the most direct compared GAAP financial measures, specifically net income in the case of adjusted net income and adjusted return on average assets, total net interest income, total non-interest income and total non-interest expense in the case of adjusted efficiency ratio and total stockholders’ equity in the case of the tangible book value per share, appears below (dollars in thousands, except per share data).  The Company believes each of the adjusted measures is useful for investors and management to understand the effects of certain non-recurring non-interest items and provides additional perspective on the Company’s performance over time as well as comparison to the Company’s peers.
     These non-GAAP disclosures have inherent limitations and are not audited.  They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the results reported in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.  Tax effected numbers included in these non-GAAP disclosures are based on estimated statutory rates.

 Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
     Statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical facts may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements are covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which are based on certain assumptions and estimates and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of the words “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “goal,” “plan,” “potential,” “estimate,” “project,” “believe,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “target,” “aim” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include statements relating to our projected growth, anticipated future financial performance, financial condition, credit quality and management’s long-term performance goals, as well as statements relating to the anticipated effects on results of operations and financial condition from expected developments or events, our business and growth strategies and any other statements that are not historical facts.
     These forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks, assumptions and uncertainties, and could be affected by many factors. Factors that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and future prospects can be found under Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere in our periodic and current reports filed with the SEC. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:

In addition, our past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future results.

We are not undertaking an obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even though circumstances may change in the future, except as required under federal securities law. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.
