ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Omnicell, a leader in transforming the pharmacy care delivery model, is committed to solving the critical challenges inherent in medication management and elevating the role of clinicians within healthcare as an essential component of care delivery. Omnicell is focused on not only helping its customers optimize medication management in each setting of care, but also placing the patient at the center and helping its customers optimize medication management across all care settings from inpatient to outpatient. We are doing so with an industry-leading medication management intelligent infrastructure to equip and empower pharmacists and pharmacies with the ability to focus on clinical care rather than administrative tasks. This intelligent infrastructure provides the critical foundation for customers to realize the industry vision of the Autonomous Pharmacy, a vision defined by pharmacy leaders for improving operational efficiencies and ultimately targeting zero-error medication management.
Business Strategy
The U.S. spent a total of $577 billion on prescription drugs that accounted for 14% of National Health Expenditures in 2021, and prescription drugs impact the vast majority of patients in virtually all settings of care. We believe there are significant challenges facing the practice of pharmacy today including, but not limited to, labor shortages, medication errors, drug shortages, medication loss due to drug diversion, significant medication waste and expiration costs, a high level of manual processes, complexity around compliance requirements, high healthcare worker turnover rates affecting tenure and expertise, hospitalizations from adverse drug events in outpatient settings, high variability in outcomes, and limited inventory visibility. Each of these challenges can translate into a major economic impact for hospitals and health systems. We believe that these significant challenges to the practice of pharmacy drive demand for increased digitization, visibility, and insights that our solutions enable, and that our solutions therefore present large opportunities.
In an effort to address these challenges and deliver solutions to help drive positive medication management outcomes, we believe a combination of technology, expertise and intelligence is needed in each care setting and across the entire continuum of care. We are focused on delivering solutions to help drive these medication management outcomes with outstanding customer experience through a mature channel in four market categories:
•Point of Care. As a market leader, we expect to continue expansion into this product market as customers increase use of our dispensing systems in more areas within their hospitals. Should labor shortages continue to challenge the delivery of healthcare services, we believe that deploying solutions and workflows that are intended to save nursing time is essential. We are more than halfway through the replacement, upgrade, and expansion cycle of older models of automated dispensing systems with our XT Series within our customer base, which we believe remains a significant market opportunity. We have been successful in market expansion through competitive conversions and we expect this success to continue. We also believe there is an opportunity for us to expand the offering and define a new standard for dispensing systems in perioperative settings. We believe our current solutions within the Point of Care market and new innovation and services will continue to help customers drive improved outcomes.
•Central Pharmacy and IV Compounding. This market represents the beginning of the medication management process in acute care settings, and, we believe, it is a significant automation opportunity for high volumes of manual, repetitive, and error-prone processes that are often common in pharmacies today. Manual medication dispensing processes are usually labor intensive, error-prone, and may lead to excess medication waste and expirations for our healthcare partners. Automating the central pharmacy dispensing process should enable customers to reallocate pharmacy labor, enhance dispensing accuracy and patient safety, and reduce medication waste and expirations. Likewise, the manual compounding of sterile IV preparations can be error-prone and create significant patient safety risks, and outsourcing sterile IV compounding could lead to increased medication costs. As a result, we believe IV automation provides a significant opportunity to enhance patient safety and reduce costs. Because adoption of our Central Pharmacy and IV automation solution is still nascent, we believe that the implementation of new solutions (as well as upgrading older technology) will be accelerated by combining technology, expertise, and intelligence into a comprehensive offering that is designed to deliver improved outcomes. We anticipate that these bundled solutions will become more critical as health systems continue to face labor shortages, increased financial pressure, and supply chain disruptions.
•Specialty Pharmacy and 340B Program. We believe that health systems will invest in more revenue-generating activities that are intended to improve patient outcomes by utilizing specialty pharmacies and the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which allow hospitals and health systems to stretch federal resources and expand patient access to healthcare by requiring manufacturers participating in Medicaid to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices to healthcare 
organizations. Specialty drugs are used for treatment of complex conditions and often require intensive patient management and specialized workflows for dispensing and care coordination. Specialty medications are projected to account for 60% of U.S. total spending on medications, with total spending projected to be approximately $420 billion in 2025. Specialty pharmacies serve as the connection between patients, prescribing physicians, and payers and work to streamline access and adherence to these specialty drugs. We believe a solution that addresses start-up and managed services for health systems that is designed to optimize their specialty pharmacy programs and the related pharmaceutical aspects of patient care will help ensure continuity of care and should contribute to the revenue and profitability of those organizations. We believe that a fully optimized specialty pharmacy operation represents one of the largest economic opportunities for hospitals and health systems.
•Retail, Institutional, and Payer. We believe the Retail, Institutional, and Payer market represents a significant opportunity as healthcare evolves. A majority of all prescription drugs are distributed in the non-acute sector. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift of certain primary care from hospitals and physician offices to other, more convenient settings, such as retail pharmacies and the home (including through telehealth technologies). New technologies and updated state board regulations appear to be spurring innovation by retail pharmacies, which, combined with the move to value-based care, we believe will drive the adoption of solutions that are intended to help providers and payers engage patients in new ways that improve patient care, reduce the total cost of care, and lead to more profitable operations. Because of the complexity of relationships between payers and providers, as well as the large number of retail pharmacies, including a significant number of independent pharmacies, we believe a network of established relationships between payers, providers and pharmacies will also be important.

We manage our operations as a single segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is our Chief Executive Officer. The CODM allocates resources and evaluates the performance of Omnicell at the consolidated level using information about our revenues, gross profit, income from operations, and other key financial data. All significant operating decisions are based upon an analysis of Omnicell as one operating segment, which is the same as our reporting segment.
Industry Background and Market
We believe our solutions support the industry vision of the Autonomous Pharmacy, are strongly aligned with trends in the healthcare market, and are well positioned to address the evolving needs of healthcare institutions.
The healthcare industry continues to experience a significant degree of consolidation, with healthcare providers combining to create larger healthcare delivery organizations. We believe this trend has increased the market’s need for integrated medication management solutions on a single platform to help improve patient and financial outcomes for both inpatient and outpatient settings. Our portfolio of hardware, which we may refer to as connected devices; digital workflows; analytics; and experts, combined with innovation, is designed with this objective in mind.
In addition, healthcare providers and facilities are affected by significant economic pressures. Annual prescription drug expenditures in the United States were approximately $577 billion in 2021, according to the IQVIA National Sales Perspective database. Based on a 2020 report by the Health Care Cost Institute, the rise in prescription drug spending accounted for 49% of the total increase in annual spending per person from 2016 to 2020. In addition, the largest growth in spending for professional services—defined as payments to physicians and other clinical care team members for services provided in physician offices and hospitals—occurred among administered drugs, which accounted for the biggest share, at 76% of the total net cumulative increase in professional services spending from 2016 to 2020. Rising costs of labor, prescription drugs, and new medical technology all contribute to increased spending. Governmental pressures surrounding healthcare reform and compliance have led to increased scrutiny of the cost and efficiency with which healthcare providers deliver their services. These factors, combined with continuing consolidation in the healthcare industry, have increased the need for the efficient delivery of healthcare in order to control costs and elevated the strategic importance of medication management and pharmacy automation across the continuum of care.
Furthermore, while complexities in medication management have increased over time along with the volume of patients and medications, many manual processes are still used, resulting in inefficient tracking and delivery of medications and supplies and increased administrative burden on many clinical staff. According to a survey conducted by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists in 2019, approximately 75% of pharmacist activities are non-clinical in nature. In addition, many existing healthcare information systems are unable to support the modernization of healthcare delivery processes or address mandated patient safety initiatives. These factors contribute to medical errors and unnecessary process costs across the healthcare sector including in medication management.
Legislation and industry guidelines, such as those issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), The Joint Commission, the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, the Institute for Safe 
Medication Practices, and state boards of pharmacy in the areas of medication management—including storage, security, and labeling—have created an environment of increased patient safety, awareness, and regulatory control. Against this backdrop, healthcare organizations, desiring to improve quality and avoid liability, are driven to prioritize investments in capital equipment, including pharmacy automation, which is a standard of care, to improve patient safety. While the overall storage and security of medications in hospitals have improved, there has been an increased focus on controlled substance management in recent years, particularly in light of the opioid crisis in the United States. According to a research report published by the Butler Center for Research in 2015, studies in the United States have shown that 10% to 15% of healthcare professionals misuse substances during their lifetime, with significantly higher levels of opioid abuse in particular. Joint Commission surveyors are seeking more documentation from hospitals demonstrating that their medication policies and procedures are adequate to prevent illicit use of controlled substances.
Medication non-adherence is widely recognized as a common and costly problem. Poor adherence results in increased hospital readmissions, deteriorated treatment outcomes, and avoidable healthcare costs. The estimated annual cost of prescription-drug related morbidity and mortality resulting from non-optimized medication therapy, including medication non-adherence, was $528 billion in 2016, according to a study published in the Annals of Pharmacotherapy in 2018. In addition, a 2017 study published in the Journal of the American Pharmacists Association found that medication issues are responsible for 26% of hospital readmissions. With approximately 74 million Americans taking five or more medications routinely (based on statistics published by the Center for Health Care Strategies and the U.S. Census Bureau in 2019), we believe pharmacists need ways to support the arduous task of maintaining patient compliance. Medication adherence can be improved through attitudinal and behavioral changes, which pharmacists can encourage and help facilitate by providing interventional support, including adherence tools such as blister cards, reminders, prescription synchronization, and patient engagement tools. We believe our EnlivenHealth portfolio has the potential to reduce hospitalizations and emergency department visits and improve patient health by increasing medication adherence.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, from February 2020 to September 2021 the healthcare industry lost 524,000 workers, although healthcare added an average of 47,000 jobs per month in 2022. Nevertheless, the 2022 American College of Healthcare Executives survey of hospital CEOs found that workforce challenges were their top concern, with 90% of survey respondents mentioning shortages of nurses and 83% citing shortages of technicians. As of the summer of 2022 there were more than 203,000 open registered nurse positions nationwide, more than twice the number just before the COVID-19 pandemic in January 2020, according to staffing firm Aya Healthcare. In addition, the shortage of pharmacy technicians, who are critical to clinical care in inpatient, outpatient and retail settings, is also acute. A nationwide survey conducted in May 2021 by the National Community Pharmacists Association found that nearly 90% of the survey’s 278 independent pharmacy owner/manager respondents said they couldn’t find pharmacy technicians to staff their pharmacies at an ideal capacity. In addition, a survey conducted by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists found that vacancy rates for pharmacy technician positions averaged from 20% to 30%, and one in ten health systems surveyed reported pharmacy technician shortages of 41% or more in 2021.
Healthcare workforce labor constraints have come at a time when hospitalizations continue to fluctuate dramatically. In addition, even apart from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, patient volume is projected to rebound and exceed pre-pandemic levels. A 2021 McKinsey & Co. survey of the leaders of 100 large private-sector hospitals in the United States—which was conducted several months prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 Omicron variant—concluded that on average hospitals’ inpatient admissions have returned to 2019 levels, and inpatient admissions were projected to increase by 4% in 2022 relative to 2019.
Omnicell’s intelligent infrastructure—incorporating technologies such as automation, robotics, and data intelligence—is designed to automate many labor-intensive medication management tasks. We believe this will help healthcare providers optimize the use of existing pharmacy staff, which is expected to free up clinicians’ time for higher-value, patient-engaging activities, such as medication therapy management, immunizations, point-of-care testing, and disease state management.
Government Regulation
Our global operations are affected by complex state, federal, and international laws and regulations. These laws and regulations relate to healthcare (including medical devices and pharmaceuticals), privacy, data protection and information security, compliance, import and export, trade, healthcare fraud, waste and abuse (including anti-kickback and false claims laws), environmental standards, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, labor and employment, as well as other areas of focus.
We receive, store, and process personal information and other data from our customers, employees, and service providers. Our customers also use our solutions to obtain and store personal information, including personal health information, from their patients and customers. As a result, we are subject to various laws and regulations related to privacy, data protection, and information security. In the United States, these include federal health information privacy laws (such as the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996), various state and federal security breach notification laws, consumer 
protection laws, and state laws addressing privacy and security. Internationally, various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have established, or are developing, their own data privacy and security legal frameworks with which we or our customers must comply including, for example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.
The manufacture and sale of most of our current medication management solutions are not directly regulated by the FDA or the DEA, although they are used by other persons (our customers) whose pharmacy, dispensing, and compounding activities may be subject to regulation by those agencies and by state boards of pharmacy. However, we manufacture and develop specifications for products classified as Class I and Class II medical devices, which are subject to FDA regulation and require compliance with the FDA Quality System Regulation as well as medical device reporting, including a sterile disposable product that required FDA 510(k) review and clearance prior to marketing and distribution. Medical devices are also subject to various other regulatory requirements, including as applicable, premarket clearance or approval, clinical trial requirements, establishment registration and device listing, complaint handling, notification and repair, replace, refund, mandatory recalls, unique device identifier requirements, reports of removals and corrections, post-marketing surveillance, and device tracking.
We also provide services and solutions to independent and health system specialty pharmacies that may require us to observe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regulations for credentialing of providers (pharmacists). These services and solutions may also be subject to DEA regulations concerning the management, storing, dispensing, and disposal of, and accounting for, controlled substances. 
Similarly, certain provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) govern the approval, manufacture, handling, distribution, and tracking and tracing of pharmaceuticals. The FDCA also regulates which medications may be compounded, and how certain compounded medications may be manufactured, distributed, and dispensed. Companies engaged in distributing or dispensing compounded pharmaceuticals may be subject to a number of requirements enforced by the FDA or other regulators. These requirements may include compliance with United States Pharmacopoeia (“USP”) or National Formulary standards, certificates of analysis, facility registration, and compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”). Furthermore, our customers may also be subject to other laws, rules, or regulations that apply to dispensers and licensing and other requirements under laws governing, and regulations promulgated by, state boards of pharmacy, that apply to compounding facilities. 
In the United States, even though we do not bill Medicare, Medicaid, or other government or commercial third-party payers, our relationships with pharmacies, healthcare providers, physicians, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and third-party payers can subject us to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations that may impact our operations include but are not limited to:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying any remuneration (including any kickback or bribe), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order, arranging for, or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs like Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity can be found guilty of violating the statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. A conviction for violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in criminal fines and/or imprisonment and requires mandatory exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Exclusion from the federal healthcare programs may also be imposed if the government determines that an entity has committed acts that are prohibited by the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. 
•The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act (“FCA”), which prohibits, among other things: (i) knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent; (ii) knowingly making, or using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim; (iii) knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government; or (iv) knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Private individuals, commonly known as “whistleblowers,” can bring FCA qui tam actions, on behalf of the government and may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in recovery or settlement. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. Moreover, entities can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to 
government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. FCA liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and significant mandatory penalties per false or fraudulent claim or statement for violations. Such per-claim penalties are currently set at $13,508 to $27,018 per false claim or statement for penalties assessed after January 30, 2023, with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015. Criminal penalties, including imprisonment and criminal fines, are also possible for making or presenting a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
•The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which, among other things, prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, and prohibits (i) knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation and (ii) making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating the HIPAA fraud provisions without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. 
•The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which authorizes the imposition of substantial civil monetary penalties against an entity that engages in activities including, among others (i) knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a claim for services not provided as claimed or that is otherwise false or fraudulent in any way; (ii) arranging for or contracting with an individual or entity that is excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs to provide items or services reimbursable by a federal healthcare program; (iii) violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; or (iv) failing to report and return a known overpayment.
•Analogous U.S. state and local laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payers, including private insurers.
•Federal laws, regulations, and guidance that govern communications and marketing to Medicare enrollees and establish limits on compensation paid for lead generation activities, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) Medicare Communications and Marketing Guidelines (“MCMG”).
•The 340B Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers participating in Medicaid to sell covered outpatient drugs at discounted prices to specified health care organizations (called 340B covered entities), including, but not limited to: sole community hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers, and certain disproportionate share hospitals serving low-income and indigent patients. These 340B covered entities are responsible for certain statutory obligations, such as a prohibition on duplicate discounts and on diversion, and are required to have certain policies and records regarding their compliance with the 340B Program. 340B covered entities may be audited with respect to their 340B Program compliance.
•The federal Stark Law (“Stark Law”), also known as the physician self-referral law, prohibits a physician from referring Medicare patients to an entity (including pharmacies) for the furnishing of “designated health services,” if the physician or a member of the physician’s immediate family has a direct or indirect “financial relationship” with the entity, unless a specific exception applies. The law further prohibits the entity from billing for any services that arise out of such prohibited referrals. Certain of these provisions are applicable to the referral of Medicaid patients as well. Designated health services include outpatient prescription drug services. The prohibition applies regardless of the rationale for the financial relationship and the reason for ordering the service. Therefore, intent to commit an illegal act is not required in order for the government to prove that a physician has violated the Stark Law. Additionally, some states have enacted statutes and regulations similar to the Stark Law, but which may be applicable to the referral of patients regardless of their payer source and which may apply to different types of services. These state laws may contain statutory and regulatory exceptions that are different from those of the federal law and that may vary from state to state.
Furthermore, our operations are impacted by trade regulations in many countries that govern the import of raw materials and finished products, and we are also subject to laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act) as well as laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. 
Since we manufacture and sell our products outside of the United States, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other state and local regulatory requirements. Additional risks are inherent to conducting business outside the United States, including more robust information governance and environmental regulations in 
the European Union, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental actions. Demand for many of our existing and new products is, and will continue to be, affected by the extent to which local regulatory requirements increase our risk and/or expense to do business in those countries.
Compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to our global operations is costly and requires sufficient resources to actively maintain various governance, risk, and compliance systems in several areas to enable us to keep abreast of the constantly evolving legal and regulatory landscape both in the United States and abroad. These areas include, without limitation, FDCA and FDA, Controlled Substances Act and DEA regulations, state board of pharmacy regulations, and laws and regulations regarding quality, information governance and security, and environmental, health and safety. We expect that there will continue to be federal and state laws and regulations, proposed and implemented, that could impact our operations and business. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in a range of fines, penalties, damages, individual imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and/or other sanctions.
Recent Acquisitions
In addition to our own organic development, we have, from time to time, acquired businesses and technologies that expand our product lines and are strategic fits for our business, and we expect to continue to seek to acquire businesses, technologies, or products in the future. The following highlights describe our acquisition activity over the past fiscal year. For more information, refer to Item 7, Management’s Discussion of Analysis and Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the heading “Acquisitions.”
On January 10, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Hub and Spoke Innovations Limited (“Hub and Spoke Innovations”), which is expected to complement Omnicell’s total solution technology portfolio for retail pharmacy in the United Kingdom to help pharmacies improve workflows, offer patients 24/7 access to their medications, and provide enhanced patient care.
Sales and Distribution
We sell our products and services primarily in the United States. Approximately 90% of our revenue was generated in this market for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our sales force is organized by geographic region in the United States and Canada, with account management executives dedicated to our customers in the top 300 U.S. health systems and health system executives focused on generating new business. Our sales are primarily made direct to end-user customers with the exception of some distribution of medication adherence consumables. Outside of the United States and Canada, we have direct sales employees in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Belgium, and Australia. For other geographies, we generally sell through distributors and resellers. Our foreign operations are discussed in Note 3, Revenues, and Note 7, Property and Equipment, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our combined direct, corporate, and international distribution sales teams consisted of approximately 570 staff members as of December 31, 2022. Nearly all of our direct sales team members have hospital capital equipment, services, or clinical systems experience. 
As of December 31, 2022, we have 151 long-term, sole-source agreements with the top 300 U.S. health systems. The sales cycle for our automation systems, from the initial sales meeting to completion of installation, can take in excess of 12 to 24 months. This is due in part to the cost of our systems and the number of people within each healthcare facility involved in the purchasing decision and installation process. To initiate the selling process, the sales representative generally contacts the chief pharmacy officer, chief information officer, chief nursing officer, chief financial officer, director of pharmacy, director of nursing, director of information technology, director of materials management, or other decision makers, and actively engages with each group within the healthcare facility about the economic, safety, efficiency, and compliance benefits of our solutions relative to competing methods of managing medications or medical and surgical supplies.
We contract with Group Purchasing Organizations (“GPOs”), each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals and other healthcare providers. Pursuant to the terms of GPO agreements, each member contracts directly with us and can purchase our product at pre-negotiated contract terms and pricing. These GPO contracts are typically for multiple years with options to renew or extend for up to two years and some of which can be terminated by either party at any time. Our current most significant GPO contracts include Vizient, Inc., Premier Inc., and HealthTrust Purchasing Group. We also have a Federal Supply Schedule Contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs (the “GSA Contract”), allowing the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and other Federal government customers to purchase our products. Some of our contracts with these organizations are terminable at the convenience of either party. The accounts receivable balances are with individual members of the GPOs and Federal agencies that purchase under the GSA Contract, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. During our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, sales to members of the ten 
largest GPOs and Federal agencies that purchase under the GSA Contract accounted for approximately 68% of our total consolidated revenues.
We offer multi-year, non-cancelable lease payment terms to assist healthcare organizations in purchasing our systems by reducing their cash flow requirements in a capital lease structure. We sell a portion of our multi-year lease receivables to third-party leasing finance companies.
Our clinical and technical consulting team supports our sales force by working with our customers to identify potential solutions intended to help them achieve their desired outcome. Our Professional Services team assists customers with the technical implementation of our solutions, including configuring our systems to address the specific needs of each individual customer. After the solutions are implemented, our Customer Success team helps our customers adopt and optimize their solutions in an effort to achieve their desired clinical and business outcomes.
We offer telephone and web-based technical support through our U.S.-based technical support centers. Our support centers are staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We have found that a majority of our customers’ service issues can be addressed by our support engineers either by phone or with remote diagnostic tools. In addition, our customers can enable access to allow us to remotely monitor system performance of certain products. Where applicable, this suite of support tools is designed to proactively monitor certain system status and can alert service personnel to potential problems to preempt system failure.
In addition, our international team handles direct sales, installation, and service for healthcare facilities in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, and for non-acute customers in Australia. Sales, installation, and service to healthcare facilities is handled through distribution partners in other parts of Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, South Africa, and South America. Our products are available in a variety of languages including Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French, Swedish, Dutch, Spanish, and German.
Manufacturing and Inventory
The manufacturing process for our automation products allows us to uniquely configure hardware and software to meet a wide variety of individual customer needs. The automation product manufacturing process consists primarily of the final assembly of components and testing of the completed product. Many of the sub-assemblies and components we use are provided by third-party contract manufacturers or other suppliers. A portion of these contract manufacturers and other suppliers are based in Asia. We and our partners test these sub-assemblies and perform inspections to assure the quality and reliability of our products. While many components of our systems are standardized and available through multiple sources, certain components or subsystems are fabricated by a sole supplier according to our specifications, schedules, and customer requirements, or are only available from limited sources. Our medication adherence product manufacturing process consists of fabrication and assembly of equipment and mechanized process manufacturing of consumables. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for the raw materials that are necessary in the production of our consumable medication packages.
Our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally set forth quality, cost, and delivery requirements, as well as manufacturing process terms, such as continuity of supply, inventory management, capacity flexibility, quality and cost management, oversight of manufacturing, and conditions for the use of our intellectual property.
Our manufacturing organization procures components and schedules production based on the backlog of customer orders. Installation of equipment and software typically occurs anywhere between two weeks and twelve months after the initial order is received, depending upon the customer’s particular needs. We utilize our backlog to manage our installation, procurement, and production activities to help improve inventory turns, reduce inventory scrap, and manage shipping costs. Shipment of consumables typically occurs between one and four weeks after an order is received.
Competition 
The markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. We compete directly with a number of companies in the medication management automation solutions market, as well as the medication adherence solutions market, on the basis of many factors, including price, quality, customer outcome, cost of operation, innovation, product features and capabilities, installation and service, reputation and brand recognition, size of installed base, range of solutions, distribution, and promotion. We expect continued and increased competition from current and future competitors in the markets in which we operate, and are affected by evolving and new technologies, changes in industry standards (including standards of care), and dynamic customer requirements. 
Furthermore, the healthcare industry has experienced a significant degree of consolidation. This consolidation may require us to adapt how we market, sell, or distribute our products. Similarly, healthcare providers have consolidated to create larger healthcare delivery organizations. As market demands, government regulations, and societal pressures continue to cause 
the healthcare industry to evolve, it could result in further business consolidations and alliances among the industry participants with whom we engage and compete.
We believe our products and services compare favorably with the offerings of our competitors, particularly with respect to proprietary technological advancements, system performance, system reliability, installation, applications training, service response time, and service repair quality.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Technology
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual restrictions, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights.
We pursue patent protection in the United States and foreign jurisdictions for technology that we believe to be proprietary and that may offer a potential competitive advantage for our products. Our issued patents expire on various dates between 2023 and 2040. We intend to seek and obtain additional United States and foreign patents on our technology. 
Our product software is generally subject to copyright protection under applicable United States and foreign copyright laws. We have also obtained United States and certain foreign registrations of various trademarks, and we intend to seek and obtain additional registrations of our trademarks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. 
Trade secrets and other confidential information are also important to our business. We protect our trade secrets through a combination of contractual restrictions and confidentiality and licensing agreements.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts generally begin with customer collaboration. The insight that we gain through this collaboration helps us to develop solutions to address the unmet needs and challenges faced by our customers. We continue to make significant investments in the industry vision of the Autonomous Pharmacy, in particular, on our cloud-based platform and in the migration of our customers from an on-premise infrastructure to our cloud-based platform. We are also investing in the further development of technology-enabled software and services including further enhancements to our Advanced Services offerings, as well as continuing to build software that is designed to enable scaling of our current service offerings. In addition, our robotic automation capabilities continue to evolve, while we work to further enhance new-to-market solutions, as well as new solutions currently in development. We have also begun work on longer-term solutions that we believe will benefit our cloud platform offerings. We also continue to enhance the other elements of our product and service portfolio. The results of our research and development efforts will further drive the advancement of our cloud-based offerings and amplify the industry vision of the Autonomous Pharmacy.
Business under Government Contracts
A number of our U.S. government-owned or government-run hospital customers have signed five-year leases, with payment terms that are subject to one-year government budget funding cycles. Failure of any of our U.S. government customers to receive their annual funding could impair our ability to sell to these customers, or to collect payments on our existing unsold leases. Effective September 2021, the U.S. government mandated changes in its Federal Supply Services contract that resulted in our determination not to enter into future leases with U.S. government customers. Our existing leases with U.S. government customers are unaffected by this change. As such, our volume of U.S. government customer leases has declined over time and will likely cease in the future. For additional information regarding these leases, see the risk factor captioned “Our U.S. government lease agreements are subject to annual budget funding cycles and mandated changes, which may affect our ability to recognize revenues and sell receivables based on such leases,” under Item 1A “Risk Factors”.
Financing Practices Relating to Working Capital
We assist healthcare facilities in financing their purchases of our systems by offering multi-year, non-cancelable lease payment terms. We typically sell the majority of the multi-year lease receivables (other than those associated with our Advanced Services, as described further below) to third-party leasing finance companies, although our ability to sell these receivables may be influenced by the perception of our customers’ ability to pay, or other restrictions, which may be influenced by factors outside of our control. 
As part of our Advanced Services offering, we provide equipment at the inception of the contract period, which is accounted for as a multi-year sales-type lease. These agreements are generally multi-year and non-cancellable. We typically retain these lease receivables for such Advanced Services in-house and service them for the duration of the associated service term.
For additional information regarding these financing activities, refer to Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Backlog
Backlog is the dollar amount of bookings that have not yet been recognized as revenue. Bookings for those Advanced Services contracts without a minimum commitment are not included in backlog. A majority of our connected devices and software license products are installable and recognized as revenues within twelve months of booking, while service revenues from Advanced Services are recorded over the contractual term. Due to industry practice that allows customers to change order configurations with limited advance notice prior to shipment and as customer installation schedules may change, backlog as of any particular date may not necessarily indicate the timing of future revenue. However, we do believe that backlog is an indication of a customer’s willingness to install our solutions and revenue we expect to generate over time. We consider backlog that is expected to be converted to revenues in more than twelve months to be long-term backlog. We believe a majority of long-term product backlog will be convertible into revenues in 12-24 months. Long-term Advanced Services backlog typically represents multi-year subscription agreements (usually with contractual terms of 2-7 years, some of which have not yet been implemented) that will be converted to revenue ratably over the contractual term.

Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Initiatives
We view Omnicell as a purpose-driven company with a social mission: Our goal of fundamentally transforming the pharmacy care delivery model is designed to dramatically improve health outcomes and lower healthcare costs for everyone. Our teams are motivated by knowing that our work to improve medication management has a tangible, real-world impact on healthcare workers, patients, and communities. 
We recognize that we are accountable not only to our customers and stockholders, but also to the global community. In April 2022, we published our 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report, which outlines our approach to corporate responsibility. This report describes and updates our contributions to how we plan on achieving a more sustainable future. We define corporate responsibility through four strategic pillars – Environmental, Social, Governance, and Innovation. We are focused on innovating to drive sustainability across our business by adhering to internationally-recognized Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guidance for the responsible sourcing of raw materials, and through elevating our diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (“DEIB”) initiatives, and creating a culture of inclusivity, engagement, and well-being.
Furthermore, there are evolving and increasing expectations from regulators, customers, investors, and employees with respect to reducing and limiting greenhouse gas emissions, without a consistent framework in which to operate globally. The enhanced stakeholder focus on matters relating to ESG activities requires deliberate, conscientious efforts to effect change while the reporting frameworks are still being considered, both in the United States and abroad. We are carefully studying ways we can contribute to realize a 1.5° Celsius future by 2030, reduce waste in our product design and manufacturing processes, as well as enhance our Social and Governance initiatives, taking cues from our internal and external stakeholders, internal assessments and direction from the Corporate Governance Committee of Omnicell’s Board of Directors. As an organization, we have adopted a risk-management approach using the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(“COSO”) framework to assess and reduce the impact of climate change on our business strategy and operations. We continually work to innovate and improve our business practices in an effort to ensure the greatest positive impact as we strive to continue to do things in “A Better Way.”
More information on our ESG initiatives and a copy of our 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report are available on our corporate website, www.omnicell.com, under the “About Us―Corporate Responsibility” tab. We are not including the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, this website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 4,230 employees worldwide (with approximately 3,660 located in either the United States or Canada), excluding individuals who are classified as temporary or contractors, which is an increase of approximately 430 employees since December 31, 2021. In November 2022, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce our global workforce across a majority of our functions affecting approximately 350 employees. The majority of employees impacted by this restructuring event were included in our headcount as of December 31, 2022 with termination dates in early 2023.
We regularly conduct employee engagement surveys, most recently via the Glint platform. Through continued investment in talent processes and acting on employee feedback, we have achieved an overall employee satisfaction score of 75, which is above the benchmark average score of similarly-sized global companies identified by Glint that use the Glint platform. We believe this reflects our positive employee relations and that Omnicell is viewed by our employees as a good place to work.
Compensation and Benefits
•We embrace a strong pay-for-performance total rewards philosophy that we believe is competitive, performance-based, and cost-effective. We offer market-competitive pay and a comprehensive benefits package. 
•Our quarterly bonus program is designed to incentivize our employees to focus on work that will further our strategic priorities.
•We offer reward and recognition programs that embed our core values into our culture and everything we do, allowing for peer-to-peer recognition and motivating our employees to continually work to advance our mission, vision, and values.
•Our ASPIRE quarterly performance review process launched on April 1, 2022 and enables our talent to reach their optimum levels of contribution to Omnicell’s business strategies, facilitates regular employee feedback, and supports our pay-for-performance philosophy.
Health and Wellness
•We offer a comprehensive wellness program designed to promote a healthy lifestyle, including exercise challenges, on-site gym facilities, virtual workouts, and health coaching. In addition to making physical health a priority, we offer mental health counseling and resources, financial coaching, and Teladoc Health services (i.e., telephone health services).
Employee Development
•Our Organizational Development function plays a strategic role in helping us develop and retain talent through an array of developmental experiences for employees to enable them to reach their highest level of performance and potential at Omnicell. We strive to develop career growth opportunities while delivering consistent learning and development experiences across all roles, functions, and locations. Our engagement survey scores in employee growth opportunities and career path, both landing above industry benchmarks, as measured by the Glint survey platform, reflect our commitment to employee development.
•We invest in our employees’ learning through robust training programs via Omnicell University and leadership development curriculums, including our Core Values in Action training series, Leadership in Action training series, New Manager Masterclass, and Change Leadership Enablement initiative. All employees also have access to LinkedIn Learning for their “on-demand” learning needs. We are refreshing our curriculums for 2023 with an emphasis on key capabilities needed for Omnicell’s future success.
•Our approach to talent development is designed to enable our organizational transformation by aligning how we lead across all levels. Most recently, we launched the New Manager Masterclass, prioritizing early managers and new managers in our revenue-generating organizations with the intention to scale across the organization in 2023.
•We have also launched a Change Leadership Enablement curriculum to better equip our leaders as they navigate high levels of organizational change. This includes live instructor-led workshops by level, toolkits, and self-guided resources to help leaders engage their employees and teams, practice resilience, and lead our organizations into the future.
•We also launched our THRIVE Senior Leadership Talent Review and Succession Process, which facilitates dialogue to identify top and high potential talent, align aspirations, bolster our leadership pipeline through succession planning, and support readiness via individual development plans.
•In order to further develop our leaders, we launched a consistent 360 feedback methodology for senior leaders in the organization and are launching a self-service option for other people leaders in early 2023.
•We are in the process of implementing Oracle Talent Management, a cloud-based human resources management software program, which includes Talent Profiles to capture employees’ internal mobility interests and facilitates internal job searches.
Recruiting & Retention
•Our Talent Acquisition team has recently increased its focus on digital recruiting, social media outlets, and university partnerships to expand Omnicell’s employer brand and reach the evolving talent pool to enhance our ability to hire the right talent to drive the organization forward. 
•We are in the process of implementing a new applicant tracking system and best-in-class talent experience platform to enhance recruiting efforts. The combination of the two are intended to increase recruiter efficiency, enable faster and better decisions, save time for value-added work, improve ease of job posting, and in turn, reduce cost per hire and increase quality of hire. 
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB)
•At Omnicell, we continually strive to develop and maintain a positive, supportive, inclusive, and diverse work environment. This includes valuing our differences and the whole person – not just the “work-person.” We are pleased to share that our September 2022 Employee Satisfaction Survey indicated that underrepresented employees, who chose to identify themselves, scored above the external benchmark with our highest scores being in our underrepresented racial/ethnic and female communities. This same trend appeared in our Inclusiveness score.
•In 2022, we developed a long-term comprehensive DEIB future data strategy as part of our three year plan. We are in the process of evolving our self-identification attributes to include more nuanced racial/ethnic and gender identity options to enhance our ability to identify strengths and opportunities going forward in 2023. With a DEIB strategy anchored in data, we expect to be able to understand opportunities for improvement and to more accurately measure the efficacy of our human resources processes and diversity programs. 
•Our external-facing aspirational long-term DEIB strategy includes supporting vendor/supplier diversity as well as strategies aimed at ensuring our products and services are inclusive and accessible. We also believe we have a role in advocating for health equity and fair and equal access to medication and medication management support. 
•Lastly, we are launching our first two Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) in early 2023, with several more expected in late 2023 and beyond, empowering our employees to be advocates for marginalized communities, as well as thought leaders to help inform our DEIB vision and strategy. We believe this ERGs model creates sustained momentum and in tandem with our comprehensive and intentional DEIB strategy, conveys our commitment to employee DEIB engagement.
