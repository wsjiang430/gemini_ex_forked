Item 1. Business.
Our Company
We accelerate medicines to patients using biosimulation software, technology, and services to transform traditional drug discovery and development.
Biosimulation is a powerful technology used to conduct virtual trials using virtual patients to better understand how drugs behave in different individuals. Biopharmaceutical companies use our proprietary biosimulation software throughout drug discovery and development to inform critical decisions that not only save significant time and money but also advance drug safety and efficacy, improving millions of lives each year.
As a global leader in biosimulation based on 2022 revenue, we provide an integrated, end-to-end platform used by more than 2,300 biopharmaceutical companies and academic institutions across 70 countries, including 39 of the top 40 biopharmaceutical companies by R&D spend in 2021. Since 2014, customers who use our biosimulation software and technology-driven services have received 90% of all new drug approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Moreover, 20 global regulatory authorities license our biosimulation software to independently analyze, verify, and review regulatory submissions, including the FDA, Health Canada, Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”), and the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”). Demand for our offerings continues to expand rapidly.
While traditional drug development has led to important therapies, such as vaccines and chemotherapy, many patients still wait for life-saving medicines, which can take more than 10 years and $2 billion to bring to market. Change is necessary to continue delivering meaningful gains in human health at an accelerated pace. We believe that biosimulation helps enable this change.
We build our biosimulation technology on first principles of biology, chemistry, and pharmacology with proprietary mathematical algorithms that model how medicines and diseases behave in the body. For over two decades, we have honed and validated our biosimulation technology with an abundance of data from scientific literature, lab research, and preclinical and clinical studies. In turn, our customers use biosimulation to conduct virtual trials to answer critical questions, such as: What will be the human response to a drug based on preclinical data? How will other drugs interfere with this new drug? What is a safe and efficacious dose for children, the elderly, or patients with pre-existing conditions? Virtual trials may be used to optimize dosing on populations that are otherwise difficult to study for ethical or logistical reasons, such as infants, pregnant women, the elderly, and cancer patients.
The benefits of biosimulation are significant. One of our customers, a top ten global biopharmaceutical company by R&D spend, estimated that they saved more than half a billion dollars over three years using biosimulation to inform key decisions. Biosimulation can reduce the size of and cost of human trials, the most expensive and time-consuming part of drug development, and in some cases, eliminate certain human trials completely, thereby accelerating time to market. An analysis published on Applied Clinical Trials Online, to which we contributed, estimated that $1 billion was saved in clinical trial costs using biosimulation for a cancer drug due to consistently shorter completion times in the later phase clinical trials.
We develop and apply our biosimulation technology throughout drug discovery and development with what we believe to be the largest and best team of scientists with deep expertise in biosimulation. Our scientists are recognized key opinion leaders who are at the forefront of the science and technology underpinning the rapidly emerging biosimulation field. We have collaborated on more than 7,000 customer projects in the past decade in therapeutic areas ranging from cancer and hematology to diabetes and hundreds of rare diseases.

Biosimulation results need to be incorporated into regulatory documents for compelling submissions. Accordingly, we provide regulatory science solutions and integrate them with biosimulation, so that our customers can navigate the complex and evolving regulatory landscape and maximize their chances of approval. Our differentiated regulatory services are powered by submissions management software and natural language processing for scalability and speed, allowing us to deliver more than 300 regulatory submissions over the past five years. Our team of regulatory professionals has extensive experience applying industry guidelines and global regulatory requirements. In addition, in October 2021, we completed the acquisition of Pinnacle 21, LLC (“Pinnacle”), which develops advanced software for standards-based data management for regulatory submission. Pinnacle enhances our software offerings in data management and the regulatory drug approval process, accelerating the speed and efficiency of developing and bringing drugs to market. Pinnacle’s products are used by the FDA and Japan’s PMDA to review the quality of submissions. 
A final hurdle to delivering medicines to patients is market access, defined as strategies, processes, and activities to ensure that therapies are available to patients at the right price. We believe that biosimulation and market access will continue to be increasingly intertwined as healthcare systems and countries move toward outcomes-based pricing. We provide technology-driven market access solutions, which help our customers understand the real-world impact of therapies and dosing regimens earlier in the process and effectively communicate this to payors and health authorities. Our solutions are underpinned by software as a service (“SaaS”) based offerings.
We have a proven track record of steady growth, driven by higher adoption of biosimulation, expansion of our technology portfolio, strategic acquisitions, and cross-selling of biosimulation, regulatory science, and market access solutions across our end-to-end platform:

● | From 2021 to 2022, our revenue increased by 17% from $286.1 million to $335.6 million.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The number of customers with Annual Customer Value (“ACV”) of $100,000 or more in revenue increased from 299 in 2021 to 370 in 2022.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that biosimulation continues to grow in adoption, driven by increasing global regulatory support and advancements in technology. We believe we are well-positioned to capture the significant market opportunity ahead of us. Our growth strategy is to build out the depth and breadth of our scalable, end-to-end biopharmaceutical platform to advance all stages of the continuum, from discovery and development to regulatory submission and market access. We continue to innovate and introduce new functionality and uses of biosimulation and technology-driven solutions. We increasingly integrate the science and data we obtain across this end-to-end platform to inform critical decisions. We further reduce the cost and time of human trials to materially accelerate the speed of development and availability of therapies to patients worldwide. As exciting new research areas arise, we attract and hire specialized talent and acquire complementary businesses to expand our offerings to address these market opportunities.
With continued innovation in and adoption of our biosimulation software, technology and services, we believe more biopharmaceutical companies worldwide will leverage more of our end-to-end platform to reduce cost, accelerate speed to market, and ensure safety and efficacy of medicines for all patients.
Our Markets
We believe our addressable market within the biopharmaceutical industry is large and rapidly expanding. The current total addressable market (“TAM”) for our solutions represents an estimated $12 billion today and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of approximately 9% to 17% annually over the next four years. Our TAM estimate includes the biosimulation market estimated at $2.8 billion, which is estimated to grow at 17% CAGR over such period according to Grand View Research; the regulatory science market estimated at $7.1 billion, which is estimated to grow at 9% CAGR over such period according to Grand View Research; and the market access market estimated at $1.8 billion, which is estimated to grow at 12% CAGR over such period according to SpendEdge. With increasing adoption of technology across all stages of drug discovery and development, we believe our end-to-end platform and growth strategies position us to further penetrate the rapidly growing technology-driven biopharmaceutical R&D market of the future that leverages advanced modeling and analytics.

Traditional drug discovery and development is costly and prone to failure. The biopharmaceutical industry was estimated to have spent a total of approximately $238 billion in 2022 on R&D. The probability of success of compounds entering Phase I trials continues under 10%. With less than 50% of Phase III drugs reaching the market, late-stage failures are common and especially disappointing as sponsors have already incurred significant cost and time. At the same time, scientific advances are driving increased complexity as the R&D pipeline shifts from small molecules to biologics and cell and gene therapies. 
With greater investment dollars being spent and increasing competition in the race to develop novel medicines, the speed and efficiency with which drugs are developed and brought to market have never been more critical. As a result, the demand for and willingness to adopt innovative approaches to discovery, development, and commercialization are rapidly increasing. Continued development and innovation in software and technology such as biosimulation, virtual trials, and real-world evidence tools are helping biopharmaceutical companies increase efficiency and decrease costs. This is further supported by regulatory agencies that have increasingly issued guidance that supports adoption of many of these innovations. For example, the FDA recently announced their Project Optimus initiative to reform the dose selection and optimization paradigm in oncology drug development to maximize both efficacy and safety. Biosimulation's use cases in dose finding and optimization are well-suited to help biopharmaceutical companies navigate this evolving regulatory landscape.
As technology and analytics become increasingly powerful and the application of new solutions is validated, we anticipate this will drive further demand for these innovations. We believe we are still in the early stages of a long-term trend that will continue to advance traditional drug discovery and development into a technology-driven era of advanced modeling and analytics.
In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that the demand for innovative technology solutions in drug discovery and development will continue to be strong. Sponsors and regulators have adopted a number of technology-driven solutions and procedures, which we believe they will continue to use and benefit from in the post-COVID environment.

The Certara End-to-End Platform
We provide both software and technology-driven services to enable customers to realize the full benefits of biosimulation in drug discovery, preclinical and clinical research, regulatory submission, and market access. Our software is primarily subscription-based with licenses ranging from one to three years.
Software
Our software, utilized by more than 20,000 licensed users in biosimulation and 40,000 more in regulatory, compliance and market access, addresses seven main applications: 1) mechanistic biosimulation; 2) empirical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic biosimulation; 3) data standardization and compliance software; 4) scientific informatics; 5) clinical 

12



outcomes databases for biosimulation; 6) authoring and management of regulatory submissions; and 7) market access communication. We deploy our software to customers on public and private cloud networks, on-premises, and in data centers.

● | Mechanistic Biosimulation Platform (Simcyp): Mechanistic biosimulation predicts both how a drug is handled within the body (known as “pharmacokinetics” or “PK”) and drug effect (known as “pharmacodynamics” or “PD”), without the need for actual in vivo human or animal studies. Seventeen of the top 20 biopharmaceutical companies by R&D spend in 2021 used the Simcyp Platform in 2022. Simcyp includes three main modules:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (“PBPK”) modeling and simulation: Our industry-standard Simcyp PBPK Simulator includes a whole-body model to run virtual “what if?” scenarios without human clinical studies. One benefit is understanding how dosing should be adjusted for special populations such as children or the elderly. A second is to identify potential drug-drug interactions so they can be included on drug labels to make the product safer. Simcyp is used by 13 regulatory agencies to evaluate submissions. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Quantitative systems pharmacology: A rapidly growing field in biosimulation, QSP combines computational modeling and vast amounts of omics (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) data to predict clinical efficacy outcomes for novel targets, drug modalities, and combination therapies. By using QSP to understand the physiological mechanisms driving efficacy, customers can terminate unpromising discovery programs earlier, and promote stronger candidates to clinical testing, thus reducing costly late-stage failures. Once marketed, the same physiological knowledge can differentiate launch messaging, helping the drug to stand out from the competition. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Quantitative systems toxicology and safety: Secondary Intelligence, our QSTS software, integrates toxicology with quantitative analysis of large networks of molecular and functional biological changes to identify drug toxicity and adverse drug reactions earlier. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Simcyp Platform has generated results that inform more than 300 label claims for nearly 90 drugs. Had customers attempted to acquire the same information through conventional human trials, we believe they would have faced in aggregate tens of millions of dollars in additional costs and significant launch delays, given that clinical trials are estimated to take 1 to 2.5 years on average and cost many millions of dollars, according to Nature Reviews Drug Discovery.

● | Empirical PK/PD Biosimulation Platform (Phoenix): Once our customers have empirical data from their actual trials assessing drug dissolution, blood concentration, and effect, they must interpret the data and make interpolations and extrapolations to inform dosing, handling of drug-drug interactions, and formulation decisions for subsequent trials and for patient use after launch. Phoenix includes multiple modules for the full empirical biosimulation workflow including conventional and biosimulation-driven interpretation (WinNonlin, NLME, and IVIVC), and related workflow modules for validated data handling, model management, and regulatory reporting (PK Submit, Certara Integral, Validation Suites). Customers benefit by gaining a validated, streamlined workflow for reporting their clinical pharmacology information to the FDA and other agencies. Furthermore, customers can be confident they are using the same tools used by regulators to evaluate their products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Data Standardization and Compliance Software (Pinnacle 21 Enterprise): Pinnacle 21 Enterprise helps to ensure that submission data is compliant with regulatory standards, which helps to enable a more efficient review process. Data standards are complex and increasingly challenging to adhere to as the volume of data in clinical trials continues to grow. Pinnacle 21 Enterprise creates consistent, compliant, and high-quality datasets that reduce the risk of costly regulatory delays, while accelerating the speed and efficiency of developing and bringing drugs to market. It is the same tool used by the FDA and Japan’s PMDA to review the quality of submissions.

Technology-Driven Services
Our technology-driven, biosimulation services help our customers who do not have staff capability or availability to gain the benefits of biosimulation. We also provide related, technology-driven services to guide our customers’ new drugs through the regulatory submission process and into the market. Our technology-driven services include integrated drug development services include mechanistic biosimulation, empirical biosimulation, drug development and regulatory writing and medical communications, regulatory operations, and market access. Regulatory agencies promote and endorse the use of biosimulation in drug development as “model informed drug discovery and development,” which integrates our software and technology-driven services to inform key decisions during drug discovery, development, approval, and subsequent market access.

● | Mechanistic Biosimulation: We utilize our Simcyp Platform for predicting PK to determine first-in-human dose selection, design more efficient and effective clinical studies, evaluate new drug formulations, and predict drug-drug interactions. We use our QSP and QSTS software to advise customers on target selection and ranking and strategies for avoiding toxicities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing functions pursue a coordinated approach with a global commercial team of business development, product management, and marketing experts. Our global commercial team collaborates with our scientists, subject matter experts, and technologists to engage with customers and prospects to understand their needs and offer tailored solutions with our biosimulation software and technology-driven services. Our scientists and experts have authored thousands of scientific publications, posters, and articles to share biosimulation knowledge and methods to advance adoption. We also partner with software distributors in global regions to expand our reach.
Competition
The market for our biosimulation products and related services for the biopharmaceutical industry is competitive and highly fragmented. In the biosimulation software market, we primarily compete with companies smaller than ourselves, such as Simulations Plus and NONMEM, a division of ICON. Other competitors include Schrodinger, open-sourced solutions such as R and PK-Sim, and internally-developed software in biopharmaceutical companies. We generally compete in the biosimulation software market on the basis of the quality and capabilities of our products, our scientific and technical expertise, our ability to innovate and develop solutions attractive to customers, our customer and regulatory agency partnerships, and price, among other factors.
Our technology-driven services generally compete with companies significantly smaller than ourselves, such as Metrum Research Group and Simulations Plus. We also face competition in this space from in-house teams at biopharmaceutical companies and academic and government institutions. In some standard biosimulation services and in regulatory science and market access, we compete with contract research organizations. We generally compete in the technology-driven services markets on the basis of our reputation and experience, our expertise and the qualifications of our team, our ability to offer services that are attractive to customers, and price, among other factors.
We believe that our competitive position is strong, and that we are able to effectively win new projects with our integrated, end-to-end platform.
Intellectual Property
We safeguard and enhance our innovative technology platforms, systems, processes, and databases with a full array of intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trade secrets, know-how, patents, and tradenames/trademarks.
All of our proprietary software products are copyright protected, and further reinforced by contractual provisions in our software license agreements prohibiting our users from reverse engineering, deriving, or otherwise using the source code and underlying algorithms for anything other than the permitted and intended use. Embedded within some of our biosimulation tools, including the Simcyp Simulator, are several decades’ worth of proprietary data that have been 

15



compiled and collated from both public and private sources. These data, in tandem with our proprietary source code and algorithms, create powerful modeling tools that cannot be readily duplicated. Continual ongoing development of source code and algorithms as well as new version release of modeling tools also ensures that our proprietary software products are difficult to copy. Our processes and systems are further protected by trade secrets and know-how, which we secure by requiring and strictly enforcing confidentiality obligations with our employees, contractors, customers, and other third parties, and invention assignment agreements with our employees, as well as through administrative and technical safeguards. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to protect. Agreements may not always provide meaningful protection. These agreements may also be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how may become known or be independently developed by a third party, or misused by any collaborator to whom we disclose such information. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. We license and use the intellectual property of third parties, primarily in our software development, although no one such license is considered to be material to the business as a whole.
We also maintain a portfolio of issued and pending patents in several of jurisdictions in which we do business. As of December 31, 2022 our patent portfolio consisted of 28 issued patents and 11 pending patent applications related to our software and technology. We do not currently consider any of our issued patents to be material to our business. Several of our most recently filed patent applications relate to our liquid biopsy project, and describe a method of gleaning information from a simple blood test that can be used to predict and optimize how that individual patient will absorb and metabolize a drug, thereby allowing a clinician to determine the optimal dosing of a drug on an individual basis. We believe these patent applications, if issued, will accelerate our leadership in individualized precision dosing. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. 
We also have applied for and/or obtained and maintain registration in the United States and other countries for numerous trademarks, including Certara, Simcyp, Phoenix, Pinnacle 21, Virtual Twin, WinNonlin, Vyasa, and BaseCase. We pursue trademark registrations to the extent we believe doing so would be beneficial to our competitive position.
We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings relating to intellectual property that, in the opinion of our management, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Human Capital
We are led by a diverse, global, and talented team of scientists, software developers, and subject matter experts who seek to understand our customers’ challenges and are dedicated to tackling these challenges. As of December 31, 2022, we employed a total of 1,204 individuals, including 1,150 full-time employees and 54 part-time employees, of which 380 held PhDs. in their respective disciplines, including clinical pharmacology and pharmacometrics. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 372 scientists, 247 regulatory experts, 75 market access specialists, and 154 software developers and technologists. Most of the senior management team and the members of our board of directors hold either PhDs and/or other advanced degrees. 
We offer our employees a myriad of professional development opportunities and support a performance-driven environment. In 2022, we focused on continuing to build a robust culture in a remote work environment by encouraging engagement and retention through Employee Spotlight programs and CEO Chats, and instituting a number of health and wellness initiatives, such as a global fitness challenge, yoga and meditation programs. We also enhanced our diversity and inclusion programs, including continuing company-wide unconscious bias training and expanding our recruiting efforts to reach a more diverse talent pool, in keeping with our CEO’s pledge to act on supporting a more inclusive workplace. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. In alignment with our purpose to accelerate medicine to patients, we strive to reinforce a positive and rewarding work environment for our employees.

Government Regulation
Regulation of Biopharmaceutical Products
The development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, promotion, distribution and post-approval monitoring and reporting of biopharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities at both the national and local levels, including the FDA in the United States, as well as those of other countries, such as the EMA in the European Union and the MHRA in the United Kingdom. Although our biosimulation software products and platforms are not approved by the FDA or other government agencies, our customers’ products are subject to these regulations, which may be applicable to us to the extent that the services and deliverables we provide to our customers are used in their marketing applications. Consequently, we must comply with relevant laws and regulations relating to certain aspects of the drug and biologic development and approval process. For example, our customers may require that documents or records we produce that may be used in the approval process be compliant with part 11 of Title 21 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, which relates to the creation, modification, maintenance, storage, retrieval, or transmittal of electronic records submitted to the FDA. Further, certain portions of our business, such as the biosimulation work we conduct in connection with designing clinical trials, must comply with current Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) and Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”) requirements as established by the International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, as adopted by the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries, which helps ensure the quality and integrity of the data we produce. To help ensure compliance with GLP and GCP, we have established a robust quality management system that includes standard operating procedures, working practice documents and processes, and quality assurance personnel to audit deliverables intended to be used in our customers’ drug and biologic approval applications.
Privacy and Cybersecurity Laws
The collection, use, disclosure, disposal, protection other processing of information about individuals, in particular healthcare data, is highly regulated both in the United States, EU and other jurisdictions, including but not limited to, under the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and other U.S. privacy, security and breach notification and healthcare information laws; the European Union’s General Data Protection Directive (“GDPR” and its national implementing laws) and other European privacy laws as well as privacy laws in other jurisdictions around the world. Although most of the clinical data we receive from our customers is de-identified within the meaning of HIPAA, in certain parts of our business, such as our real-world data and analytics program, we hold personal health and other information relating to persons who have been, are and may in the future be involved in clinical trials. The collection, retention, use, disclosure and other processing of such information is highly regulated, including under the laws described above. These data privacy and cybersecurity laws govern the use, handling and disclosure of information about individuals.
In relation to HIPAA, we do not consider our service offerings to generally cause us to be subject as a covered entity; however, in certain circumstances we are subject to HIPAA as a business associate. HIPAA requires the use of standard contracts (business associate agreements), notice and consent procedures and other privacy and cybersecurity standards. Accordingly, we may enter into business associate agreements with our customers who are covered entities under HIPAA. These business associate agreements define our obligations to safeguard the protected health information of patients provided by our covered-entity customers. We have adopted practices and have implemented procedures to satisfy the privacy and security rules and other to safeguard the receipt, maintenance and transmission of protected health information.
In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and many state attorneys general interpret federal, state and local consumer protection laws to impose evolving standards for the handling and security of personal information, including health-related information. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, which concern consumer notice, choice, security and access. Consumer protection laws require us to publish statements that describe how we handle information about individuals and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their information.
Certain states have also adopted robust data privacy laws. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which became effective on January 1, 2020, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act , which became effective 

17



on January 1, 2023, imposes obligations and restrictions on businesses regarding their collection, use, and sharing of personal information and provides new and enhanced data privacy rights to California residents, such as affording them the right to access and delete their personal information and to opt out of certain sharing of personal information. Additional privacy laws in Virginia, Connecticut, Colorado and Utah which also take effect during 2023 have similar requirements but more limited application (i.e., only consumers and not employees or B2B data). The interpretation and application of the new state laws and their pending regulations are uncertain. 
The processing of any personal data regarding individuals in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) , including personal health data, is subject to the GDPR as of May 25, 2018. The GDPR and the UK’s post-Brexit equivalent of the GDPR (“UK GDPR”) is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive personal data, cross-border transfers, notice and consent and contractual obligations with vendors and service providers. The GDPR permits data protection authorities to impose large administrative penalties for violations of the GDPR or UK GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater, for each law.
Legal developments in Europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States, including the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “CJEU”) decision to invalidate the EEA to U.S. personal data transfer framework as well as decisions from regulators in Austria, Denmark, France and Italy about transfers made by Google. We also currently rely on the standard contractual clauses to transfer personal data outside the EEA, including to the United States, among other data transfer mechanisms pursuant to the GDPR. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism,), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances; this has created uncertainty. 
In response to the data privacy laws discussed above and those in other countries in which we do business, we have implemented a multi-disciplinary privacy management program that includes technological safeguards, processes, contractual third-parties provisions, and employee trainings to help ensure that we handle information about our employees and customers in a compliant manner. Concurrently, we observe a trend toward expanding privacy data protection law both in number and scope that will expand our obligations. We may need to modify our practices and incur expenses to accommodate this evolving privacy compliance landscape.
Bribery, Anti-Corruption and Other Laws
We are subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar anti-bribery laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 (“Bribery Act”), which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, in the United States, we may also be subject to certain state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, that are intended to reduce waste, fraud and abuse in the health care industry. Our employees, distributors, and agents are required to comply with these laws, and we have implemented policies, procedures, and training, to minimize the risk of violating these laws.
