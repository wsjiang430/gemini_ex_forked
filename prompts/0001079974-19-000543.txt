Industry Overview
 
By all measures, the market for hemp and cannabis, and for products based on extracts of hemp and cannabis, is expected to grow substantially over the coming years. Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics are forecasting the combined market to reach nearly $45 billion within the U.S. in the year 2024. While much of this market is expected to be comprised of high potency THC-based products that will be sold in licensed dispensaries, the research firms are still predicting the market to grow to $5.3 billion, $12.6 billion, and $2.2 billion by 2024 for the product areas of low THC cannabinoids, THC-free Cannabinoids and pharmaceutical cannabinoids, respectively.
 Industrial Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) has been cultivated by humans for thousands of years. Hemp was originally cultivated as a source of fibers with most of this early cultivation occurring in temperate climates, thus most genotypes had very low tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content. Hemp was introduced into North America in the early part of the 17th century and it played an important part in early American agriculture throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, with cultivation in virtually every one of the original American colonies.
 North American hemp was not only utilized for fibers, but hemp seed oil became an important industrial input that was used in inks, paints, varnishes and many other products. The proliferation of cotton cultivation and the significant profitability of tobacco cultivation in the mid-1800s led to a sharp decline in hemp production. From the mid 1800s through the pre-World War II period, hemp cultivation continued at relatively low levels. During World War II, hemp production increased to meet the military needs for fibers to support various industrial production.
 The early 1930’s as a period when higher THC strains of cannabis native to southeast Asia were introduced to North America and Western Europe and as a result, psychoactive effect producing strains became tied to the very low THC containing industrial strains that were being cultivated in North America. This resulted in efforts to prohibit the cultivation and possession of Cannabis sativa L. in the United States.
 Since 1937, Cannabis sativa L. has been a federally regulated Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 811 (the “CSA”), regulated by the Drug Enforcement Agency (the “DEA”).
 It was not until 2014 when a distinction between the use of Cannabis sativa L. for medical, recreational, and industrial purposes was made via Section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of 2014, which cleared a legal path for industrial hemp to be grown in three limited circumstances, 1) by researchers at an institute of higher education, 2) by state departments of agriculture, or 3) by farmers participating in a research program permitted and overseen by a state department of agriculture.

In 2016 the DEA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a joint statement detailing the guidelines for growth of industrial hemp as part of state-sanctioned research programs. Those guidelines state that hemp can only be sold in states with pilot programs, plants and seeds can only cross state lines as part of permitted state research programs, and seeds can only be imported by individuals registered with the DEA.
 We believe the recent passage of the 2018 Farm Bill will allow the Company to expand its marketplace opportunities. On December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, otherwise known as the “Farm Bill”. Prior to its passage, hemp, a member of the cannabis family, and hemp-derived CBD were classified as a Schedule I controlled substances, and so illegal under the CSA. With the passage of the Farm Bill, hemp cultivation is broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law.
 Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent THC. THC refers to the chemical compound found in cannabis that produces the psychoactive “high” associated with cannabis. Any cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3 percent THC would be considered non-hemp cannabis—or marijuana—under federal law and would thus face no legal protection under this new legislation and would be an illegal Schedule 1 drug under the CSA.
 Additionally, there will be significant, shared state-federal regulatory power over hemp cultivation and production. Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, state departments of agriculture must consult with the state’s governor and chief law enforcement officer to devise a plan that must be submitted to the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the “USDA”). A state’s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once the Secretary of USDA approves that state’s plan. In states opting not to devise a hemp regulatory program, USDA will construct a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states must apply for licenses and comply with a federally run program. This system of shared regulatory programming is similar to options states had in other policy areas such as health insurance marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act, or workplace safety plans under Occupational Health and Safety Act—both of which had federally-run systems for states opting not to set up their own systems.
 The Farm Bill outlines actions that are considered violations of federal hemp law (including such activities as cultivating without a license or producing cannabis with more than 0.3% THC). The Farm Bill details possible punishments for such violations, pathways for violators to become compliant, and even which activities qualify as felonies under the law, such as repeated offenses.
 
One of the goals of the previous 2014 Farm Bill was to generate and protect research into hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill continues this effort. Section 7605 re-extends the protections for hemp research and the conditions under which such research can and should be conducted. Further, section 7501 of the Farm Bill extends hemp research by including hemp under the Critical Agricultural Materials Act. This provision recognizes the importance, diversity, and opportunity of the plant and the products that can be derived from it, but also recognizes that there is still a lot to learn about hemp and its products from commercial and market perspectives.
 
FDA Regulation of Hemp Extracts
 
The United States Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) is generally responsible for protecting the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of (1) prescription and over the counter drugs; (2) biologics including vaccines, blood & blood products, and cellular and gene therapies; (3) foodstuffs including dietary supplements, bottled water, and baby formula; and, (4) medical devices including heart pacemakers, surgical implants, prosthetics, and dental devices.
 
Regarding its regulation of drugs, the FDA process requires a review that begins with the filing of an investigational new drug (IND) application, with follow on clinical studies and clinical trials that the FDA uses to determine whether a drug is safe and effective, and therefore subject to approval for human use by the FDA.

Aside from the FDA’s mandate to regulate drugs, the FDA also regulates dietary supplement products and dietary ingredients under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. This law prohibits manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded. This means that these firms are responsible for evaluating the safety and labeling of their products before marketing to ensure that they meet all the requirements of the law and FDA regulations, including, but not limited to the following labeling requirements: (1) identifying the supplement; (2) nutrition labeling; (3) ingredient labeling; (4) claims; and, (5) daily use information.
 
The FDA has not approved cannabis, marijuana, hemp or derivatives as a safe and effective drug for any indication. As of the date of this filing, we have not, and do not intend to file an IND with the FDA, concerning any of our products that contain CBD derived from industrial hemp or cannabis delivered in the State of California. Further, our products containing CBD derived from industrial hemp are not marketed or sold using claims that their use is safe and effective treatment for any medical condition subject to the FDA’s jurisdiction.
 
The FDA has concluded that products containing cannabis or industrial hemp derived CBD are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the U.S. Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, respectively. The FDA’s position is that products contai ning cannabis, CBD or derivatives are Schedule 1 drugs under the Controlled Substances Act, and so are illegal. Our products containing CBD derived from industrial hemp or cannabis delivered in the State of California are not marketed or sold as dietary supplements. However, at some indeterminate future time, the FDA may choose to change its position concerning generally cannabis and products containing hemp derived CBD, and may choose to enact regulations that are applicable to such products. In this event, our industrial hemp b ased products containing CBD and cannabis may be subject to regulation (See Risk Factors).
 
Hemp Extract, CBD and Cannabinoid NutraceuticalsEffective on July 1, 2019, the Company acquired Action Nutraceuticals, Inc., a California Corporation (“Action Nutraceuticals”) and its assets from our CEO, Arman Tabatabeai. Action Nutraceuticals is a developmental stage company engaged in research and development relating to powdered soft drink, coffee, and tea mixes containing non-psychoactive CBD. The value of the transaction value was nominal, at only one thousand dollars ($1,000). Therefore, the Company believes its acquisition of Action Nutraceuticals, Inc. is not an acquisition of a significant amount of assets, or a transaction defined by 17 CFR § 229.404 \- (Item 404) “Transactions with Related Persons, Promoters and Certain Control Persons” that would require specific disclosure under the section cited. Regardless, the Company will disclose the transaction pursuant to 17 CFR § 229.404 - (Item 404) “Transactions with Related Persons, Promoters and Certain Control Persons.” No intellectual property, patents or trademarks were acquired in the transaction.
 
The Company’s research and development efforts relative to the production of nutraceuticals will center on methodologies to infuse hemp extracts, CBD and other cannabinoids into highly bioavailable powders that will theThe Company plans to utilize its internally-developed infusion technologies, technical knowhow and equipment acquired from Action Nutraceuticals to manufacture and sell consumer-oriented powdered drink mixes that include industrial hemp derived, non-psychoactive CBD as an ingredient. All products sold are being specifically developed with a composition containing less than three-tenths of one percent (0.3%) of THC concentration by dry weight. The value of the transaction value was nominal, at only one thousand dollars ($1,000). Therefore, the Company believes its acquisition of Action Nutraceuticals, Inc. is not an acquisition of a significant amount of assets, or a transaction defined by 17 CFR § 229.404 \- (Item 404) “Transactions with Related Persons, Promoters and Certain Control Persons” that would require specific disclosure under the section cited. Regardless, the Company will disclose the transaction pursuant to 17 CFR § 229.404 - (Item 404) “Transactions with Related Persons, Promoters and Certain Control Persons.” No intellectual property, patents or trademarks were acquired in the transaction.
 We plan to market these products directly through our website and as “white labeled” products to other brands and companies that market similar products or brands.

The Company has put into place a product production and R&D agreement with Cannabis Nanosciences, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (“Cannabis Nanosciences”) (the “Cannabis Nanosciences Agreement”) to produce products for the Company and to jointly research and develop new methods to infuse foods, beverages, cosmetics, nutraceuticals, and topicals with cannabinoids. Relative to product production, Cannabis Nanosciences will receive a royalty equal to thirty percent (30%) of the gross margins generated by the Company directly relating to all products produced by Cannabis Nanosciences for the Company and for all future products produced by Cannabis Nanosciences for the Company. Under the terms of the agreement, Cannabis Nanosciences will be responsible for product design, formulation, production, packaging and quality control. The Company will be responsible for maintaining the lease on the production facility, product distribution, contract labor for production, product sales, working capital availability and all other costs associated with production, distribution and operation of the business.
 The Company has entered into a lease for a production and warehouse facility located in Los Angeles, California to produce such products. The term of the lease is 12 months at $3,600 per month, beginning August 2019.
 A late autumn 2019 product launch is planned for the product lines.
 Methods for Industrial Hemp Cultivation in the Southern and Central Agro-Climatic Zones of California Research Program
 The Company is in the process of researching and developing methodologies to effectively cultivate, process and distribute industrial hemp within the southern and central agro-climatic zones of California. Efforts toward this goal have centered on efforts to develop and test methods to germinate industrial hemp seedlings.
 There can be no assurance the research and development of methods for industrial hemp cultivation in the southern and central agro-climatic zones of California will be successful and there can be no assurance any business opportunities will result from these efforts. Please see the section labeled “Risk Factors to our Business” for additional information.
 Cannabinoid Isolation and Hemp Extract Fractionalization Research Program
 The Company is conducting research regarding new technologies and methodologies to isolate the various cannabinoids and other substances that make up industrial hemp oil and to possibly commercialize any such methods.
 Raw or semi-refined oils and extracts of industrial hemp are comprised of many substances including fatty acids, proteins, waxes, cannabinoids, and other substances. While there is an active market for these raw or semi refined oils, there is an increasing demand for the isolated components. In many cases these isolated components, such as cannabidiol, sell for significantly higher prices on a per weight basis than does the raw or semi refined oil or the unprocessed biomass. Thus, the value of the raw or semi-refined oils can be significantly increased by isolating the more valuable component parts. In other cases, hemp extracts and oils are more valuable if certain components are isolated and then removed. This process is often referred to as remediation.
 The Company is working to develop the technologies required for such component isolation and/or remediation. Based on the degree of success obtained, the Company is thought to have several options for revenue generation, including, but not limited to, 1) a sale of developed intellectual property, if any, 2) sales of developed equipment, if any, to other parties that wish to engage in the business of hemp oil component isolation, or 3) sales of the hemp oil components into the marketplace.
 Management of the Company believes participation in ventures for the developed technologies and methodologies could be lucrative, although the Company has not entered into any such relationships. There can be no assurance the Company will achieve any level is success relative to these endeavors. Please see the section labeled “Risk Factors to our Business” for additional information.

Polymeric Nanoparticles and Polymeric Nanofibers Research Program
 Relative to the Cannabis Nanosciences Agreement, the Companies agreed to collaborate relative to the development and possible commercialization of hemp extract and cannabinoid polymeric nanoparticles, in addition to the possible development and commercialization of polymeric nanofibers.
 Polymeric nanoparticles are very small solid particles with a size in the range of 10–1000 nanometers (nm or billionth of a meter), and are made of biodegradable and biocompatible polymers or copolymers, in which cannabinoids or other active ingredients can be entrapped or encapsulated. Polymeric nanoparticles are noted for and have attractive characteristics, such as small size, near water solubility, high degrees of bioavailability, long shelf life and stability during storage. These properties are thought to be especially beneficial relative to delivery of cannabinoids and hemp extracts to the human body.
 Polymeric nanofibers are fibers with diameters several orders of magnitude smaller than conventional fibers, typically in the size range of a few nanometers to one micrometer. Due to their large surface areas per unit mass and extremely small pore size, these nanofibers demonstrate unique properties, making the technology especially well suited to transdermal delivery of active ingredients, including cannabinoids.
 Via the Cannabis Nanosciences Agreement, the Company gained rights, at commercial rates, to integrate all nanoparticle and nanofibers developed by Cannabis Nanosciences on behalf of the Company. Upon availability, the Company plans to investigate integrating solid cannabinoid nanoparticles into our powdered drink mix products and possibly into future products.
 The Company recently announced its researchers had achieved sub-micron sized particles of various cannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD), with and without inclusion of TPGS as a bioenhancer. Work continues on numerous other forms on nanoparticles containing cannabinoids and other compounds. Additionally, the Company has developed several formulations of nanofibers for transdermal applications and other non-nanotechnology cannabinoid delivery systems.
 There can be no assurance the Company will achieve any level is success relative its endeavors in the CBD/cannabinoid infused soft drink marketplace or relating to its relationship with Cannabis Nanosciences, Inc.
 Please see the section labeled “Risk Factors to our Business” for additional information.
 Edible, Dissolvable Film Enhanced with Solid Nanoparticles of Cannabinoids Research Program
 The Company is seeking to commercialize a unique invention of edible, disposable film enhanced with solid nanoparticles of cannabinoids under an agreement with Kirby & Padgett, LLC a California limited liability company entered into during June of 2019, attached herein.
 Management believes there are numerous applications for such a product, such as a container for ready-made foods, protein powders, vitamins, and nutraceuticals that can be simply dropped into cold beverages, thus allowing the consumer to avoid additional steps of mixing ingredients. Additionally, since the film is impregnated with what is believed to be highly bioavailable cannabinoids, the film will perhaps serve a dual purpose as a delivery vehicle for cannabinoids to the body. Future versions of the film could include ingredients such as vitamins, trace minerals or active pharmaceutical ingredients.
 On June 6, 2019, the Company entered into a joint intellectual property ownership and consulting agreement with Kirby & Padgett, LLC, a California Limited liability company (“Kirby”) (the “Kirby Agreement”) in order to more fully develop and to commercialize the invention. Any intellectual property developed under the collaboration effort will be considered joint property with all rights, title and interest assigned jointly to the Company and Kirby. Each Party shall work with the other Party relative to all business and monetization of such new Joint Intellectual Property and neither Party shall have any preferred rights over the other. Additionally, either party shall have the right to market the new invention with any and all revenues, costs and profits to be shared on a fifty percent/fifty percent (50%/50%) shares by the parties. All expenses will be agreed to in advance, with each Party sharing based on predetermined percentages of such expenses.

Competition
 We are entering markets that are highly competitive.
 Relative to our prospects for commercializing polymeric nanoparticles and nanofibers, there are many known indirect competitors with various approaches to cannabinoid infusion for foods, beverages and other consumer products. While these currently available technologies are not direct competition to our developing technologies, such technologies may be viewed as being directly competitive by the marketplace in the future. Many of the current market participants are well extinguished with considerable financial backing. We expect the quality and composition of the competitive market with in the hemp processing environment to continue to evolve as the industry matures. Additionally increased competition is possible to the extent that new states and geographies into the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes that de-criminalize and regulate cannabis and hemp products, such as and including the 2018 Farm Bill. We believe the contemporaneous growth of the industry as a whole will result in new customers entering the marketplace, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our expected operations and results relating to our hemp processing businesses.
 Relative to our non-psychoactive cannabis extract powdered drink business, there are relatively few market participants in this sector, but management of the Company believes the competitive situation will advance quickly over the coming months as new entrance target to this potentially lucrative market opportunity. Additionally, while the large beverage industry participants have yet to launch products in this area, we believe such market entrances are likely as the regulatory environment is clarified by the FDA. This could significantly affect our ability to achieve market success.
 We believe the contemporaneous growth of the cannabis beverage sector and the industry as a whole will result in new customers entering the marketplace, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our expected operations and results relating to hemp cultivation and processing business and joint venture.
