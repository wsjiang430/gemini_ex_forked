Overview
 
Company History
 
iCoreConnect, Inc., (the "Company") a Nevada Corporation, was incorporated on July 17, 2001, and builds secure cloud-based communications systems, focused on healthcare, although the core technology can be adopted to other vertical markets that require a high degree of secure data communication, such as the legal, financial and education fields. iCoreConnect’s iCoreExchange (Health Information Exchange), allows providers and health care professionals to exchange patient specific healthcare information via the internet while maintaining compliance with all Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) regulations and the current Direct protocol. Our solutions allow providers and health care professionals to use the internet in ways previously unavailable to them due to HIPAA restrictions to quickly and cost effectively exchange and share patient medical information.
 
iCoreConnect Inc., creates communication and practice management software that allows you to share information at the highest level of security and is a national provider of secure communications for high compliance industries. Our software allows organizations and individuals to easily exchange information utilizing 2048-bit encryption in full compliance of current federal laws. The Company currently designs, engineers and sells cloud-based software for the healthcare industry, with potential application in other industries with a need for secure information communication compliance.
 
Due to current HIPAA regulations, providers and health care professionals have been prohibited from electronically exchanging unencrypted personal health information. Until recently, there was no cost-effective platform for transferring this information in a HIPAA compliant environment. We set out to solve this problem.
 
The Company markets several products under the iCoreConnect umbrella which solve several industry problems.
 
We provide customizable secure cloud-based software. iCoreConnect currently markets six different software products: iCoreExchange, iCoreCodeGenius, iCoreSecure, iCoreMD, iCoreDental and iCoreExam. In addition, the Company has a Meaningful Use consulting division.
 
iCoreExchange – The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) precludes the electronic transfer of personal health information by unsecured means. Given that standard email has been deemed insecure, a huge bottleneck exists in the flow of patient information. Factor in the HIPAA fines that range from $50,000 up to $1,500,000 per violation virtually mandates the need for our iCoreExchange.
 
iCoreExchange offers hospitals, State Health Information Exchanges (HIE), physician practices and dental practices and other healthcare professionals the extensive functionality needed to transfer patient health information to anyone, anywhere and at any time. Our iCoreExchange provides a secure, HIPAA compliant email solution using the Direct Protocol that allows doctors to send and receive secure email, with attachments, to and from other healthcare professionals in the network. Our iCoreExchange also provides a secure email mechanism to communicate with users outside the exchange e. g. patients and referrals. The iCoreExchange gives its users the ability to build a community, access other communities and increase referrals and collaboration. Our iCoreExchange allows the end user to email in a HIPAA compliant manner while also sending a Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (CCDA) or Continuity of Care Record (CCR) file with discrete data which then can be accessed on any Electronic Health Record (EHR) system.
 
iCoreCodeGenius - In November 2017, we purchased ICD Coding Software that provides the coding standards for the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO). It contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases.
 
We enhanced the ICD Coding Software and rebranded and launched it as iCoreCodeGenius. We can document any medical condition in 60 seconds or less. It includes a full ICD10 lookup and guidance, automatic prompting of comorbidities and HCC’s, appropriate reimbursement with a high degree of accuracy, and the ability to reduce or eliminate queries and denials.

iCoreSecure - Recent newscasts have been replete with reporting regarding many breaches of consumer personal information. We used our expertise and development capabilities from our HIPAA compliant iCoreExchange and developed an encrypted email solution for anyone that needs encrypted email to protect personal and financial data called iCoreSecure. iCoreSecure could be used in the insurance, real estate, financial and many other industry sectors that have a need for secure encrypted email.
 
Electronic Health Record (EHR) Software Platforms - We have developed and launched two fully developed EHR software platforms for the medical and dental communities called iCoreMD and iCoreDental. Both platforms were launched in response to input from doctors and dentists telling us they wanted a cloud-based software that had more flexibility than the current medical and dental platforms in the marketplace. 
iCoreMD and iCoreDental are complete Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), cloud-based, certified ambulatory EHRs that allow full practice management for the provider. The software tracks patient demographics, scheduling, billing, electronic medical records, electronic claims, e-prescriptions, labs, merchant services and has multiple reporting capabilities as well as data analytics to run the practices.
 
We achieved ONC certification for both iCoreMD and iCoreDental in November, 2015. ONC certification allows our software to meet the current Meaningful Use guidelines which allows doctors and dentists to receive up to $63,750 from the Federal government EHR incentive program. ONC certification also confirms that our software meets all currently required clinical measures as well as security measures and interoperability that are required by the government. The certificate number for our iCoreDental and iCoreMD software is 150120r0.
 
iCoreExam our third EHR was created using the same technology stack that produced iCoreMD and iCoreDental. iCoreExam can provide healthcare records and other information anywhere that you have a tablet or laptop. It includes medical, dental and vision. You can setup treatment anywhere you have internet access and send complete, rich data medical records anywhere in the world with full HIPAA compliance. It has customizable forms for intake and demographics. You can examine and treat with full documentation and coding as well as perform real-time digital charting and treatment planning.
 
All development has been completed by our own in-house development team and dedicated contractors which gives us the ability to make changes very rapidly in order to facilitate customers’ requests and quickly adapt to market demands for present and future products. We intend to continue to build vertical, specialized EHR’s to meet the demand of the marketplace requesting alternatives to one size fits all products currently in the marketplace. We will continue to develop and create cloud-based products the marketplace is requesting as we deem them financially viable.
 
Meaningful Use Consulting
 
iCoreConnect has developed a Meaningful Use Consulting Division assisting both medical and dental healthcare providers becoming “Meaningful Use” compliant to qualify for federal incentive funds under the Federal Meaningful Use Incentive Funds Program. The Meaningful Use program pays providers up to $63,750 and iCoreConnect receives approximately 20% of what the doctor is paid that year. The contract is generally for 6 years which correlates to the Meaningful Use time line.
Competition
 
The Company experiences competition from a variety of sources with respect to virtually all of its products and services. The Company knows of no single entity that competes with it across the full range of its products and systems; however, each of the lines of business in which the Company is engaged is highly competitive. Competition in the markets served is based on a number of considerations, which may include price, technology, applications, experience, know-how, reputation, service and distribution. While we believe we offer a unique combination of products and services, such as the iCoreExchange and our customizable Practice Management software, a number of competitors offer one or more similar products and services in one or more of our niche markets.

Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) are products that facilitate the dissemination of healthcare information electronically across organizations within a region or community. A HIE provides the capability to electronically move clinical information among disparate health care information systems while maintaining the data integrity of the information being exchanged. The goal of a HIE is to facilitate access to and retrieval of clinical data to provide safer, more timely, efficient, effective, equitable, patient centered care. An HIE is also useful to state public health authorities to assist in the analysis of the population.
 
We compete with most HIE companies in that their applications typically encapsulate certain of the functionality that iCoreConnect offers in addition to their core function of more primary data exchange. These products and services are secure messaging, electronic referrals and CCR/CCD exchange. The additional functions we offer are the ability to integrate fully with EMRs and to centralize data pulled from multiple, disparate information systems. Most HIE systems or projects are still focused on interoperability and exchange of patient specific information within their organizations. iCoreConnect offers HIEs the opportunity to provide a comprehensive interoperability that can extend beyond their membership thereby making the transition from paper to electronic health records more relevant to their membership. Although the HIEs could be considered competitors, we believe that we can work together with the HIEs to enhance their offerings to members and non-members by making their service valuable-added and function as originally intended.
