General
 
With $83.1 million of sales in 2018 (of which 14% were export sales), Tandy Leather is, to our knowledge, the world's largest specialty retailer of leather and leathercraft related items based on sales. We offer a wide range of leather, quality tools, hardware, small machines, accessories, liquids, lace, kits and teaching materials. We sell our products primarily through company-owned stores and through orders generated from our website, www.tandyleather.com.  We also manufacture the leather lace and some of our do-it-yourself kits that are sold in our stores and website.  We maintain our principal offices at 1900 Southeast Loop 820, Fort Worth, Texas 76140.  Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol "TLF."
 
The business that today is the Company was founded in Fort Worth, Texas in 1919.  Tandy Leather Company opened its first branch store in 1927, gradually to expanding to 132 stores by 1969, then more rapidly to 288 stores by 1976.  In 1980, two former Tandy executives founded Midas Leathercraft Tool Company, a Texas corporation ("Midas") that eventually became the Company, which focused on the distribution of leathercraft tools.  The founders of Midas entered into an agreement with Brown Group, Inc., a major footwear retailer, to develop a chain of wholesale stores known as "The Leather Factory."  In 1985, Midas purchased the assets related to The Leather Factory's six stores from Brown Group, Inc.  In 1993, we changed our name to The Leather Factory, Inc, and we reincorporated in the state of Delaware in 1994. In 2000, The Leather Factory purchased the operating assets of Tandy Leather Company, and in 2005, the combined enterprise again changed its name to Tandy Leather Factory, Inc.
 
Our Development in Recent Years
 
We have built our business by offering our customers quality products in one location at competitive prices.  We have expanded our store footprint by opening new stores and by making numerous acquisitions of small businesses in strategic geographic locations.  In 1996, we expanded into Canada by acquiring our Canadian distributor, The Leather Factory of Canada, Ltd.  In 2000, we acquired the operating assets of two subsidiaries of Tandycrafts, Inc.  We began expanding outside of North America by opening a store in the United Kingdom in 2008, then Australia in 2011 and Spain in 2012.  We opened another store in the United Kingdom in 2015.  At December 31, 2018, we operated 117 stores located in North America and 3 stores in the United Kingdom, Australia and Spain.

Business Strategy
 
In October 2018, we announced certain leadership changes including the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer and departures of our former Chief Executive Officer and our former President.  Under our new leadership, we are developing a strategic plan to drive future sales growth and long-term profitability and cash flow.  Several key actions are currently being undertaken including:

· | We are developing a new operating model to better serve our retail and wholesale/business customers and align the cost structure with the related margin earned from those customers. Today, our retail stores serve both our retail and wholesale/business customer base, as well as fulfilling web orders. We believe that a more focused, tailored operating model can provide a better foundation for future sales growth. For higher-margin retail customers, we will continue to offer high-touch customer service in our stores, with deeply knowledgeable sales associates to create an engaging retail experience. For lower-margin but higher per-customer volume wholesale and business customers, we are developing a more convenient and efficient service model to provide the product assortment at the quantity and price that our wholesale and business customers need and expect. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enhancing our business processes and infrastructure to support our new operating model requires additional headcount in areas such as human resources, technology and marketing, all key functional areas in which we have not adequately invested in the past. We expect that 2019 will be a year of investment and change as we rebuild our infrastructure, and there may be some overlap of old and new systems and people during this transition, which will inflate our 2019 operating expenses. However, we believe that these investments in talent and technology will drive future sales growth and cost savings in 2020 and beyond. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Going forward, our North American retail fleet will be managed primarily for cash flow. New locations will be assessed for their ability to produce incremental cash, not just sales. Evaluating our current store fleet in light of these criteria and our new operating model has resulted in the closing of three underperforming stores to date, located in Irving, Texas; Fort Wayne, Indiana; and Minto, Australia. The Irving and Fort Wayne locations closed in January 2019, while the Minto store closed in February 2019. We will continue our evaluation of our store portfolio, which is likely to result in four to six additional store closures in 2019. This is a shift in direction from prior management, who had pursued top-line growth through opening new stores.

· | To support our business priorities, we have made changes to our retail field organization and incentives. These steps include reducing our store management structure from eleven districts reporting to two regional managers into eight zones reporting to a single VP of the Retail division. In addition, effective February 2019, store managers' base pay now reflects the cost of living in their store location and their overall performance rating, with bonus now based on performance and cash flow indicators such as sales, labor cost and inventory. Previously, store managers all received the same base pay, regardless of cost of living, and a percentage of store operating income, most components of which were out of their control. We believe that these changes will better reward managers' focus on retail excellence and customer service and will make us much more competitive in the retail labor market. In addition, restructuring fleet management into a smaller number of territories allows us to invest in other areas of the business, including a dedicated leathercraft training program for our store associates and building our new commercial model.

· | To better capture market share and drive sales growth from business/wholesale/ commercial customers, we have created a separate team that will operate as a traditional wholesale sales and service organization. Commercial Account Representatives will call directly on Commercial customers, national accounts and institutions, and those customers will be served with direct shipments from our Fort Worth distribution center. We believe a small, dedicated team of experts can provide the right product offering, pricing and service that Commercial customers need in a way that our 100+ store managers could not. And the low operating cost of this team is better aligned to the lower gross margin Commercial business. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We are improving our brand proposition, with a focus on our products, promotion and pricing. Specifically, we are reevaluating legacy programs such as our participation in local and national trade shows, our Wholesale Club loyalty program (in which memberships have been declining), and in our digital and social media programs. Our goal is to ensure that we are investing in the right areas to drive sales growth. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We intend to maximize the yield on our cash. In 2018, cash provided from operations was $7.4 million, and cash on hand was $24.1 million at December 31, 2018. During 2018, we repurchased 243,387 shares at an average price of $6.79 per share, which was primarily funded by our stock repurchase line of credit. At December 31, 2018, the balance on our line of credit was $9.0 million with an interest rate of 4.0%. To date in 2019, we have repaid that debt and repurchased an additional 53,626 shares totaling $306,000 under our buy-back program.

Customers
 
Our customer base is diverse, with individual retail customers as our largest customer group, representing approximately 61% of our 2018 sales.  The remaining portion of our 2018 sales were to our wholesale, manufacturer and institutional groups (including horse and tack shops, Western wear, crafters, upholsterers, cobblers, auto repair, education, hospitals, prisons and other large businesses that use our products as raw materials to produce goods for resale); we refer to this group collectively as "wholesale" "non-retail", "business", or "commercial" customers.  Generally, our retail customers provide a higher gross profit as compared to our non-retail customer groups.  
 
No single customer's purchases represented more than 0.6% of our total sales in 2018.  Sales to our five largest customers represented 1.0%, 1.2% and 1.4% of consolidated sales in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.  We do not believe the loss of any one of these customers would have a significant negative impact on our consolidated results.
 
We strive to provide 100% satisfaction to our customers, which we believe promotes customer loyalty.  In addition, we offer credit terms to our non-retail customers upon receipt of a credit application and approval by our credit manager.  Generally, our open accounts are net 30 days.   
 
Merchandise
 
Our products are generally organized into 12 categories.  We carry a wide assortment of products including leather, lace, hand tools, kits, and craft supplies.  We operate a light manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas, whose processes generally involve cutting leather into various shapes and patterns using metal dies.  The factory produces approximately 10% of our products and also assembles and repackages products as needed.  Products manufactured in our factory are distributed through our stores under the TejasTM brand name.  We also distribute product under the Tandy LeatherTM, Eco-FloTM, CraftoolTM, and Dr. Jackson'sTM brands.  We develop new products through the ideas and referrals of customers and store personnel as well as the analysis of trends in the market.  
 
Sales by product category were as follows:
 

Product Category | 2018 Sales Mix | | | 2017 Sales Mix | | 2016 Sales Mix
------------------------+----------------+-----+---+----------------+-----+---------------
Belts strips and straps | | 3 | % | | 4 | % | 4 | %
Books, patterns, videos | | 1 | % | | 1 | % | 1 | %
Buckles | | 3 | % | | 2 | % | 3 | %
Conchos^ | | 2 | % | | 2 | % | 2 | %
Craft supplies | | 2 | % | | 2 | % | 2 | %
Dyes, finishes, glues | | 8 | % | | 7 | % | 7 | %

Operations
 
We operate in two segments, based on management responsibility and store location:  North America and International. With the recent closure of two our International stores (Northampton, UK in September 2018 and Minto, Australia in February 2019), the International segment is becoming less significant, and we may reevaluate our segment reporting in the future.  
 
Information regarding net sales, gross profit, operating income, and total assets attributable to each of our segments is included within Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and within Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Note 11, Segment Information, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Our stores offer a broad selection of products combined with leathercraft expertise in a one-stop shop. Not only can customers purchase leather, related accessories and supplies necessary to complete his or her project from a single source, but many of our store associates are also leathercrafters themselves and can provide suggestions and advice on our customers' projects.  The size and layout of the stores are planned to allow large quantities of product to be displayed in an easily accessible and visually appealing manner.  For example, leather may be displayed by the pallet where the customer can see and touch, assessing first-hand the numerous sizes, styles, and grades offered.  We also offer open workbenches where customers can try out tools and stamps.
 
From a physical standpoint, our stores range in size from 1,200 square feet to 22,000 square feet, with the average size of a store approximating 4,000 square feet.   The types of premises utilized for our stores are generally light industrial offices or warehouse spaces or older strip shopping centers in proximity to major freeways or well-known crossroads, which typically offer lower rent.  More recently, we began opening new stores with a smaller footprint, averaging 2,500 square feet in upgraded retail centers to seek to attract more retail customers.
 
Historically, we generate slightly more sales in the fourth quarter of each year due to the holiday shopping season (approximately 28-30% of annual sales), while the other three quarters average approximately 22-24% of annual sales each quarter.
 
In 2018, we began testing extended store hours and Sunday openings, to better accommodate our customers' schedules.  Depending on our store location and customer demographics, some of our stores may open early to accommodate more wholesale customers, while stores that serve more retail customers may open later.  In addition, some of our stores that are located in retail shopping centers are opening on Sundays. Previously, the hours of operation of our stores were uniform across all of our locations.
 
Distribution
 
Our stores receive the majority of their inventory from our central distribution center located in Fort Worth, Texas, although occasionally, merchandise is shipped directly from the vendor.  Inventory is typically shipped to the stores from our central distribution center on a weekly basis.  Customer orders are typically filled as received, and we do not typically have backlogs.
 
We attempt to maintain the optimum number of items in our product line to seek to minimize out-of-stock situations against carrying costs involved with such an inventory level.  We generally maintain higher inventories of imported items to seek to ensure a continuous supply.  The number of products offered changes every year due to the introduction of new items and the discontinuance of others.  We carry approximately 2,600 items in the current lines of leather and leather-related merchandise.  Historically, all items have been offered in all stores, unless prohibited by local regulations.
 
Competition
 
Most of our competition comes in the form of small, independently-owned businesses, some of which are also our customers.  These small businesses generally carry only a limited line of leathercraft products.  We also compete with several national chains that carry leathercraft products on a very small scale relative to their overall product line.  We also compete with internet-based retailers that provide customers the ability to search and compare products and prices without having to visit a physical store.  We compete on convenience, price, availability of merchandise, customer service, depth of our product line, and delivery time.  While there is competition with a number of our products, to our knowledge, there is no direct competition affecting our entire product line.  Further, to our knowledge, our store chain is the only one in existence solely specializing in leathercraft, which we believe provides a competitive advantage over internet-based retailers.  We also believe that our large size relative to most competitors gives us the advantage of being able to purchase large volumes and stock a full range of products in our stores, as well as hire experienced store personnel that offer product expertise and project advice.
Suppliers
 
We purchase merchandise and raw materials from approximately 150 vendors dispersed throughout the United States and approximately 20 foreign countries. In 2018, our 10 largest vendors accounted for approximately 68% of our inventory purchases.
 
Because leather is sold internationally, market conditions abroad are likely to affect the price of leather in the United States.  Aside from increasing purchases when we anticipate price increases (or possibly delaying purchases if we foresee price declines), we do not attempt to hedge our inventory costs.
 
Overall, we believe that our relationships with suppliers are strong and do not anticipate any material changes in these supplier relationships.  Due to the number of alternative sources of supply, we do not believe that the loss of any of our principal suppliers would have a material impact on our operations.
 
Compliance With Environmental Laws
 
Our compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection laws has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 684 people, 562 of whom were employed on a full-time basis.  We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.  Overall, we believe that relations with employees are good.
Intellectual Property
 
We own approximately 120 registered trademarks, including federal trade name registrations for "Tandy Leather Factory," "The Leather Factory," "Tandy Leather Company," and "Tandy."  We also own approximately 60 registered foreign trademarks worldwide.  We own approximately 600 registered copyrights in the United States covering more than 800 individual works relating to various products.  We also own several United States patents for specific belt buckles and leather-working equipment.  These rights are valuable assets, and we defend them as necessary.
Foreign Sales
 
Information regarding our revenues from the United States and abroad and our long-lived assets are found in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Information.  For a description of some of the risks attendant to our foreign operations, see Item 1.A "Risk Factors".
