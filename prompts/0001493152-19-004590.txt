Item 1. Business.
Medical Device Business
 
On October 8, 2018, we announced that following a review of the Company’s commercial and product development strategies, the Board of Directors has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to focus primarily on the commercialization of its Particle Immuno-Filtration Assay (PIFA®) Technology platform. PIFA® technology is a patented immunoassay method which rapidly and accurately detects target antigens or antibodies. It is the technology platform utilized in the Company’s core commercialized products, the PIFA® Heparin/PF4 and PIFA® Pluss/PF4 rapid assays, which test for an allergic reaction to Heparin. These products account for the significant majority of the Company’s current revenues.
 
We will continue to manufacture BreathScan Alcohol Detectors (based on the Company’s Micro Particle Catalyzed (MPC®) Biosensor technology platform) and Tri-Cholesterol products (based on the Company’s Rapid Enzymatic Assay (REA™) technology platform). Furthermore, we have determined that it is not economically appropriate to further develop or pursue approval of the PIFA PLUSS Chlamydia Rapid Assay device. As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s marketed products consist solely of its PIFA® Heparin/PF4, Tri-Cholesterol and BreathScan Alcohol Detectors.
 
All of Akers’ rapid, single-use tests are performed in vitro (outside the body) and are designed to enhance patient well-being and reduce the cost of healthcare. The Company’s current product offerings focus on delivering diagnostic assistance in a variety of healthcare fields/specialties, including diagnostic rapid manual point-of-care tests for the detection of allergic reactions to Heparin, for cholesterol screening and for on- and off-the-job alcohol safety initiatives.
 
Akers believes that low-cost, single-use testing not only saves time and money, but allows for more frequent, near-patient testing which may save lives. We believe that our FDA-cleared rapid diagnostic tests help facilitate targeted diagnoses and real-time treatment. We also believe that our rapid diagnostic tests surpass most other current diagnostic products with their flexibility, speed, ease-of-use, readability, low cost and accuracy. In minutes, detection of a medical condition can be performed on single-patient specimens without sacrificing accuracy.

We believe the use of rapid tests, which can be performed at the point-of-care when and where the patient is being consulted, can result in immediate diagnostic decisions and subsequent treatment regimens and is an important development in the practice of medicine. Point-of-care testing addresses today’s challenges in the healthcare industry, such as:
 

● | cost pressures/efficiency of healthcare delivery; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | need for easy to use, accurate at-home tests for individuals to monitor their personal health and wellness 

Strategy
 
Akers’ strategy for the medical device business is to leverage where possible its distributor relationships, while exploring strategies for further reducing its costs.
 
Akers has developed and currently maintains strategic relationships with established companies in the following key market segments:
 

● | Clinical Laboratories; 
--+----------------------------------------------------
● | Physicians’ Office and Urgent Care Clinics; and 
● | Retail; 

Current Testing Platform Technologies
 
Particle ImmunoFiltration Assay (PIFA ®) Technology
 
PIFA ® technology is an accurate, rapid, immunoassay (a procedure for detecting or measuring specific proteins or other substances through their properties as antigens or antibodies) method based on the selective filtration of dyed microparticles coated with antigen or antibody. The microparticles are combined with a test sample (whole blood or serum) within a self-contained device. If a patient tests positive for the antibody or antigen, a binding event will occur and the dyed microparticles will be trapped by a filter within the device. As a result, the test window will be void of any color. Conversely, if the patient tests negative, the dyed microparticles will flow freely into the test window. Specific to the PIFA Heparin tests, the Company has two international patents and one US patent granted in force.
MPC Biosensor Technology
 
MicroParticle Catalyzed Biosensor (“MPC Biosensor”) Technology permits the rapid identification of medical conditions through biomarkers in exhaled breath. MPC Biosensor-based products contain microparticles that change color to indicate a positive test result. The microparticles are coated with agents that both decrease the time to result and exhibit a more defined color change when appropriate. MPC Biosensor-based products are packaged in small, disposable cartridges through which test subjects can easily blow for several seconds.
Rapid Enzymatic Assay
 
Rapid Enzymatic Assay (“REA”) technology enables the rapid detection of metabolites in blood in assay formats that are easy-to-use and deliver quantitative or semi-quantitative results. Products that employ REA technology are primarily intended for pharmaceutical, nutritional and over-the-counter (“OTC”) markets. Akers has three U.S. patents for this technology covering our Tri-Cholesterol “Check” test.
Current Sample Preparation Technology
 
Rapid Blood Cell Separation Technology
 
Akers’ Rapid Blood Cell Separation (“Separator”) Technology, labeled under the brand name seraSTAT ®, further accelerates the rate at which a test result is obtained as the often-required sample preparation step is abbreviated drastically. Conventional methods of blood cell separation are labor-intensive and time-consuming, typically involving blood collection and laboratory personnel, as well as electrically-powered centrifuges and other specialized equipment. The disposable Separator device requires only a small-volume blood sample obtained through a venous blood draw. Akers has obtained the appropriate US FDA regulatory clearances for seraSTAT ® as a stand-alone device and the technology is currently integrated into PIFA PLUSS PF4 devices. The seraSTAT ® Rapid Blood Cell Separation Technology is currently protected by two U.S. patents and three international patents.
Current Product Portfolio
 
Akers is positioned as a provider of rapid diagnostic solutions.
 
At present, Akers’ commercialized product portfolio incorporates the four aforementioned proprietary platform testing and sample preparation technologies: PIFA ®, MPC Biosensor, REA and Rapid Blood Cell Separation Technology.

The following table sets forth our marketed products, identifies the appropriate “prescription use” or “OTC” designation and the required clearance that has been obtained.
 
Our marketed and emerging products include:
 

Product | Platform | Marketed/Pipe line | FDA Clearance Required Prescription Use/OTC | FDA Clearance Status Obtained/Needed | Description 
------------------------------------------+----------+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BreathScan TM | MPC | Marketed | OTC | Obtained | Disposable breath alcohol detector 
PIFA ® Heparin/PF4 & PIFA PLUSS ® PF4 | PIFA | Marketed | Prescription Use | Obtained | Rapid tests for Heparin/PF4 antibodies to detect an allergy to the widely used blood thinner, Heparin 
seraSTAT ® | seraSTAT | Marketed | Prescription Use | Obtained | Rapid Blood Cell Separator, marketed under the brand name seraSTAT ®, further accelerates the rate at which a test result is obtained as the often-required sample preparation step is abbreviated drastically. 
Tri-Cholesterol “Check” ® | REA | Marketed | OTC | Obtained | Rapid test for Total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol and estimates low density lipo protein 

 
PIFA ® Technology
 
The core products marketed under the PIFA ® platform are the PIFA ® Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay, and the PIFA PLUSS ® PF4.
 
PIFA ® Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay and PIFA PLUSS ® PF4 remain the only FDA-cleared rapid manual assays that quickly determine if a patient being treated with the blood thinner Heparin may be developing a drug allergy. This clinical syndrome, referred to as Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (“HIT”), reverses the Heparin’s intended therapeutic effect and transforms it into a clotting agent. Patients with HIT are at risk of developing limb- and life-threatening complications, so the timely test result provided by Akers’ Heparin/PF4 devices is paramount to effective clinical decision making. The largest at-risk populations are patients undergoing major cardiac or orthopedic surgical procedures. It is estimated that up to 50% of cardiac surgery patients develop HIT-antibodies. Given the size of the aging baby boomer market segment and the prevalence of cardiac disease, surgeries within this category is expected to increase, as would the potential demand for the Company’s convenient, rapid tests.


The PIFA ® Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay improves the standard of care in HIT-testing with its result delivered in less than five minutes after the patient sample has been prepared. Traditional methods required the use of expensive equipment, specialized laboratory personnel and hours of technician time to complete the 20+ assay test procedure in-house. Clinicians were subjected to a 24-to-72 hour turnaround time if the HIT-antibody determination was outsourced to a reference laboratory. Especially in the latter scenario, the patient information obtained is retrospective in nature as the HIT-antibody result cannot be factored into time-sensitive diagnostic and treatment decisions.

-


The Company has also introduced PIFA PLUSS ® PF4 to U.S. hospitals to further improve the rate at which healthcare professionals can obtain a HIT-antibody result. This PIFA ® line extension merges the ease-of-use of the PIFA testing platform with Akers’ recently patented Rapid Blood Cell Separation Technology, marketed under the brand name seraSTAT ®. The marriage of these two technologies condenses the sample preparation and analysis procedures as the precise micro-volume of a seraSTAT ® -prepared patient specimen is delivered directly into the PIFA ® cassette for immediate testing. This eliminates an additional one-hour of sample processing time and the need for healthcare personnel to have access to a centrifuge to separate the liquid fraction of blood from the cellular fraction. As a result, HIT-testing can be initiated and completed at or near the point-of-care, especially in emergency and critical care departments where time-efficient diagnostic results can drastically improve patient outcomes.
 
Since the appropriate regulatory clearances have been obtained in the United States for these products, the Company does not anticipate needing to fund additional clinical trials to facilitate product marketing domestically. In addition, the current technical file that has been assembled for seraSTAT ® and PIFA PLUSS PF4 ® will also be used to support Akers’ CE-marking self-certification process for potential sales in the EU; the PIFA Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay is already CE-marked.
 
MPC Biosensor Technology
 
Breath Alcohol Products
 
BreathScan ® originated the disposable breath alcohol detector category and was the first single-use breathalyzer to obtain the FDA 510(k) clearance in 2006 for Over-the-Counter use required to facilitate sales to U.S. consumers; CE certification is not required to market the product in the EU because BreathScan ® results are not used to diagnose any medical conditions. The Company’s breath alcohol detector technology was granted an Australian Standard certification trademark, which cleared the commercial pathway for product sales in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.
 
The Company’s disposable breath alcohol detectors are available in versions designed to detect .02%, .04%, .05% and .08% blood alcohol concentrations (“BACs”) and provide users with a test result in two minutes. If the crystals in the interior of the device change from yellow to aqua, the user has tested positive for the specific alcohol level. Should the crystals remain yellow, the result is negative.
 
REA Technology
 
Akers’ Tri-Cholesterol “Check” test is initiated with an easy-to-obtain finger stick blood sample, and provides users with an estimate of both their total and high-density lipoprotein (“HDL”) cholesterol levels, and by a simple calculation, approximates their low density lipoprotein (“LDL”) level.
 
Tri-Cholesterol “Check” has the appropriate U.S. FDA market clearances and is also CE-marked for sale in the European Union. At present, the Company’s Tri-Cholesterol “Check” business strategy has been to focus on distribution activities to the OTC markets in the U.S. through partners such as Abbott in the U.S.
 
The REA Technology is currently protected by three United States patents (8,808,639; 8,003,061; 8,425,859).
 
Sample Preparation Technology
 
Rapid Blood Cell Separation Technology
 
In addition to the Company’s testing platforms, Akers’ patented Rapid Blood Cell Separation (“Separator”) Technology, marketed under the brand name seraSTAT ® , which further accelerates the rate at which a test result is obtained as the often-required sample preparation step is abbreviated drastically. Conventional methods of blood cell separation are labor-intensive and time-consuming, typically involving blood collection and laboratory personnel, as well as electrically-powered centrifuges and other specialized equipment.


The required micro-volume specimen of serum or plasma is immediately extracted and introduced into a rapid assay device for real-time analysis. The savings afforded by the Separator device can be measured in time and cost given its quick turn-around-time and straightforward, easy-to-master procedure.
 
Currently, seraSTAT ® is integrated into PIFA PLUSS PF4 devices. The seraSTAT ® Rapid Blood Cell Separation Technologies is currently protected by two United States patents (7,896,167; 8,097,171) and one international patent (JP 4,885,134).
 
Competition
 
Competitors of Akers include other companies developing and marketing rapid, point-of-care diagnostic devices and companies with dedicated laboratory instruments and/or automated test systems. We face intense competition from companies with dominant market positions within the in vitro diagnostic testing market such as Alere/Abbott, ACON Laboratories, Inc., Immucor, Inc., OraSure Technologies, Inc., and Quidel Corporation.

6
-


The Company believes the primary criteria for determining competitiveness within the rapid point-of-care sector are cost, ease-of-use, speed, readability, accuracy and flexibility. 
 
That said, our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have and may be better able to:
 

● | respond to new technologies or technical standards; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | devote resources to the development, production, promotion, support and sale of products; 
● | acquire other companies to gain new technologies or products that may displace our product lines; 
● | react to changing customer requirements and expectations; 
● | manufacture, market and sell products; and 
● | deliver a broad range of competitive products at lower prices. 

 
Our principal competitors are able to leverage their broader product portfolios and dominant market positions in some segments by, for example, bundling their products into specially priced packages that create strong financial incentives for their customers to purchase their products. These practices may negate savings customers would gain from buying select products from Akers and may deter such customers from buying Akers’ products. We expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings.
 
How we Generate Revenue
 
Our revenue comes from selling rapid, screening and testing products, largely through our distributor networks. Most of our assays are used in the clinical laboratory to ultimately help healthcare professionals to diagnose a medical condition or complication that may require treatment. Other products can be sold over-the-counter, to the general public, to help assess an individual’s status as it relates to his/her blood alcohol or cholesterol level.
Our Current Markets
 
Regarding the Company’s test for the heparin drug allergy, the testing market largely resides within the clinical hospital laboratories of medical facilities.
 
The markets for alcohol breathalyzers are reached through a network of large and small distributors. These markets include industrial safety, education, social responsibility and retail.



Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
We are a vertically integrated manufacturer, producing substantially all of our devices in-house. The vast majority of our products start out as high quality, medical grade polymers and exit our facilities as fully manufactured and packaged medical devices. As a result, we have a short supply line between our raw materials and finished goods which gives us greater control over our product quality. The downside of our in-house manufacturing is the requirements for facilities, personnel, and equipment. This approach also requires mid-to-long-term planning and the ability to predict future needs. Many of our processes are unique to us, but the Company’s flexible manufacturing capabilities and unused current capacity generally translate into relatively short production timelines.
 
We use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products. We purchase all of our raw materials and select items, such as packaging, from external suppliers. In addition, we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of proprietary know-how, quality assurance, sole source availability, or due to regulatory qualification requirements. U.S. medical device manufacturers must establish and follow quality systems to help ensure that their products consistently meet applicable requirements and specifications. The quality systems for FDA-regulated products are known as current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP’s”). cGMP requirements for devices in part 820 (21 CFR part 820) were first authorized by section 520(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production requirements.
 
Effective February 2, 2018, the Company’s quality management system was certified as compliant with the International Standards Organization’s (“ISO”) 13485:2016 requirements for the design, manufacture and distribution of medical devices including in vitro diagnostic products.
 
Distribution
 
We distribute our products through direct and indirect channels of distribution. We have indirect distribution channels in the U.S. with, among others, Cardinal Health 200, Inc. (“Cardinal Health”) and Fisher Healthcare, a Division of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (“Fisher Healthcare”) for the Company’s PIFA Heparin/PF4 assays. The relationships with Cardinal Health and Fisher Healthcare provide us with access to most U.S. hospitals.

-


The Company’s PIFA Heparin/PF4 assays are also sold direct to certain hospitals and buying groups.
 
With respect to the Company’s breath alcohol product, Akers has focused its commercial attention within the on-the-job safety/human resources sector. Access was and currently is largely achieved through designated BreathScan ® distributors and limited arrangements in which the Company serves in an OEM capacity.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions to protect our proprietary platform technologies and our brands. We also rely on confidentiality procedures and agreements with key employees and distribution/business partners where appropriate, and contractual provisions to achieve the same. We do not pursue patent protection where the possibility for meaningful enforcement is limited.
 
The Akers logo is a registered trademark in the U.S. Other registered trademarks/service marks include: BreathScan ®, PIFA ® , PIFA PLUSS ® , seraSTAT ® .

Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products are distributed. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.
 
Akers’ Tri-Cholesterol “Check” and the PIFA Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay are CE-marked for sale in the EU for professional use. The CE-mark must be affixed to a product that is intended, by the manufacturer, to be used for a medical purpose.

Foreign Regulation
 
Many foreign countries in which we market or may market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to those of the FDA. International sales are subject to foreign government regulation, the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ. Companies are now required to obtain a CE Mark, which shows conformance with the requirements of applicable European Conformity directives, prior to sale of some medical devices within the European Union. Some of our current products that require CE Markings have them and it is anticipated that additional and future products may require them as well. As of the date of this filing, the Company has received CE marks for eight for of its commercialized products/product components: PIFA Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay; Heparin/PF4 Serum Panels; and Tri-Cholesterol “Check” and Blow Bags.
 
Third-Party Reimbursement
 
Health care providers, including hospitals, that purchase our products generally rely on third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and private payors, such as indemnity insurers and managed care plans, to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of the products and the procedures in which they are used. As a result, demand for our products is dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payors.
 
CMS, the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, along with its contractors establishes coverage and reimbursement policies for the Medicare program. In addition, private payors often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare. We cannot assure you that government or private third-party payors will cover and reimburse the procedures using our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate.
 
In general, Medicare will cover a medical product or procedure when the product or procedure is reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury. Even if the medical product or procedure is considered medically necessary and coverage is available, Medicare may place restrictions on the circumstances where it provides coverage. For some of our products, our success in non-U.S. markets may depend upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from the third-party payors through which health care providers are paid in those markets. Health care payment systems in non-U.S. markets vary significantly by country, and include single-payor, government managed systems as well as systems in which private payors and government-managed systems exist, side-by-side. For some of our products, our ability to achieve market acceptance or significant sales volume in international markets may be dependent on the availability of reimbursement for our products under health care payment systems in such markets. There can be no assurance that reimbursement for our products, will be obtained or that such reimbursement will be adequate.
 
Other U.S. Regulation
 
We must also comply with numerous federal, state and local laws relating to matters such as healthcare fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims, HIPAA, environmental protection, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, fire hazard control and, among other things, the generation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances.
Exploration of Strategic Alternatives
 
On November 7, 2018, we announced that our board of directors had initiated a process to evaluate strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. This process will consider a range of potential strategic alternatives including, but not limited to, business combinations, while simultaneously supporting the Company’s management and employees in the execution of the Company’s current business activities. On November 19, 2018, the Company further announced that in its evaluation of strategic alternatives it will consider a range of potential strategic alternatives including, but not limited to, business combinations in sectors different than that currently engaged in, including cannabis related industries. Furthermore, members of the Company’s board have recently met with a number of companies in cannabis related industries at the MJBizCon conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the Company has engaged the firm of Feuerstein Kulick LLP as a legal advisor as the board continues its evaluation of opportunities within the cannabis and related space.
