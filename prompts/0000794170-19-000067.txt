ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Toll Brothers, Inc., a corporation incorporated in Delaware in May 1986, began doing business through predecessor entities in 1967. When this report uses the words “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company,” they refer to Toll Brothers, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. References herein to fiscal year refer to our fiscal years ended or ending October 31. 
General
We design, build, market, sell, and arrange financing for an array of luxury residential single-family detached, attached home, master planned resort-style golf, and urban low-, mid-, and high-rise communities, principally on land we develop and improve, as we continue to pursue our strategy of broadening our product lines, price points and geographic footprint. We cater to luxury first-time, move-up, empty-nester, active-adult, affordable luxury and second-home buyers in the United States (“Traditional Home Building Product”), as well as urban and suburban renters. We also design, build, market, and sell urban low-, mid-, and high-rise condominiums through Toll Brothers City Living® (“City Living”). At October 31, 2019, we were operating in 23 states, as well as in the District of Columbia.
In the five years ended October 31, 2019, we delivered 35,146 homes from 724 communities, including 8,107 homes from 426 communities in fiscal 2019. At October 31, 2019, we had 715 communities containing approximately 59,200 home sites that we owned or controlled through options.
Backlog consists of homes under contract but not yet delivered to our home buyers. We had a backlog of $5.26 billion (6,266 homes) at October 31, 2019; we expect to deliver approximately 93% of these homes in fiscal 2020.
We operate our own architectural, engineering, mortgage, title, land development, golf course development, and landscaping subsidiaries. We also operate our own security company, TBI Smart Home Solutions, which provides homeowners with home automation and technology options. In addition, we operate our own lumber distribution, house component assembly, and manufacturing operations. 
We are developing several land parcels for master planned communities in which we intend to build homes on a portion of the lots and sell the remaining lots to other builders. Two of these master planned communities are being developed 100% by us, and the remaining communities are being developed through joint ventures with other builders or financial partners.
In addition to our residential for-sale business, we also develop and operate for-rent apartments primarily through joint ventures. These projects are located in multiple metropolitan areas throughout the country and are being operated or developed, (or we expect will be developed) with partners under the brand names Toll Brothers Apartment Living and Toll Brothers Campus Living.® At October 31, 2019, we or joint ventures in which we have an interest controlled 56 land parcels as for-rent apartment projects containing approximately 18,300 units. 
Primarily through several joint ventures, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gibraltar Capital and Asset Management, LLC (“Gibraltar”), provides builders and developers with land banking and venture capital, owns certain foreclosed real estate, and is a participant in an entity that owns and controls a portfolio of loans and real estate.
See “Investments in Unconsolidated Entities” below for more information relating to our joint ventures.
Acquisitions
As part of our strategy to expand our geographic footprint and product offerings, in fiscal 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets and operations of Sharp Residential, LLC (“Sharp”) and Sabal Homes LLC (“Sabal”), for approximately $92.8 million and $69.6 million, respectively, in cash. Sharp operates in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia; Sabal operates in the Charleston, Greenville, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina markets. The assets acquired, based on our preliminary purchase price allocations, were primarily inventory, including approximately 2,550 home sites owned or controlled through land purchase agreements. In connection with these acquisitions, we assumed contracts to deliver 204 homes with an aggregate value of $96.1 million. The average price of those undelivered homes was approximately $471,100 as of the applicable acquisition date. As a result of these acquisitions, our selling community count increased by 22 communities. 
Our Communities and Homes
Our traditional home building communities are generally located in affluent suburban areas near major highways providing access to major cities and are generally located on land we have either acquired and developed or acquired fully approved and, in some cases, improved. Our City Living communities currently operate in Hoboken and Jersey City, New Jersey; New York 
City, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the suburbs of Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles, California; and Seattle, Washington.
At October 31, 2019, we were operating in the following major suburban and urban residential markets: 

• | Boston, Massachusetts, metropolitan area


• | Fairfield, Hartford, and New Haven Counties, Connecticut


• | Westchester and Dutchess Counties, New York


• | Boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn in New York City


• | Central and northern New Jersey


• | Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, metropolitan area


• | Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania


• | Virginia and Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C.


• | Raleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina, metropolitan areas


• | Charleston, Greenville, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina


• | Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area


• | Southeast and southwest coasts and the Jacksonville, Orlando, and Tampa areas of Florida


• | Detroit, Michigan, metropolitan area


• | Chicago, Illinois, metropolitan area


• | Dallas, Houston, and Austin, Texas, metropolitan areas


• | Denver, Colorado, metropolitan area and Fort Collins, Colorado


• | Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area


• | Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada, metropolitan areas


• | Boise, Idaho, metropolitan area


• | Salt Lake City, Utah, metropolitan area


• | San Diego and Palm Springs, California, areas


• | Los Angeles, California, metropolitan area


• | San Francisco Bay, Sacramento, and San Jose areas of northern California,


• | Seattle, Washington, metropolitan area, and


• | Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area.

We develop individual stand-alone communities as well as multi-product, master planned communities. Our master planned communities, many of which include golf courses and other country club-type amenities, enable us to offer multiple home types and sizes to a broad range of move-up, empty-nester, active-adult, and second-home buyers. We seek to realize efficiencies from shared common costs, such as land development and infrastructure, over the several communities within the master planned community.
Each of our detached home communities offers several home plans with the opportunity for home buyers to select various exterior styles. We design each community to fit existing land characteristics. We strive to achieve diversity among architectural styles within a community by offering a variety of house models and several exterior design options for each model, preserving existing trees and foliage whenever feasible, and curving street layouts to allow relatively few homes to be seen from any vantage point. Our communities have attractive entrances with distinctive signage and landscaping. We believe that our added attention to detail gives each community a diversified neighborhood appearance that enhances home values.
Our traditional attached home communities generally offer one- to four-story homes, provide for limited exterior options, and often include commonly owned recreational facilities, such as clubhouses, playing fields, swimming pools, and tennis courts.
We are continuously developing new designs to replace or augment existing ones to ensure that our homes reflect current consumer tastes. We use our own architectural staff and also engage unaffiliated architectural firms to develop new designs.
In our Traditional Home Building Product communities, a wide selection of options is available to home buyers for additional charges. The number and complexity of options in our Traditional Home Building Product typically increase with the size and base selling price of our homes. Major options include additional garages, extra fireplaces, guest suites, finished lofts, and other additional rooms. We also offer numerous interior fit-out options such as flooring, wall tile, plumbing fixtures, lighting and home-automation and security technologies.
We market our high-quality homes to upscale luxury home buyers, generally comprised of those persons who have previously owned a principal residence and who are seeking to buy a larger or more desirable home — the so-called “move-up” market. We believe our reputation as a builder of homes for this market enhances our competitive position with respect to the sale of our smaller, more moderately priced homes.
We continue to pursue growth initiatives by expanding our geographic footprint and by broadening our product lines and price points to appeal to buyers across the demographic spectrum. In addition to our traditional “move-up” home buyer, we are focusing on the “empty-nester” market, the millennial generation, and the affordable luxury buyer.
We market to the “empty-nester” market, which we believe has strong growth potential. We have developed a number of home designs with features such as one-story living and first-floor master bedroom suites, as well as communities with recreational amenities, such as golf courses, marinas, pool complexes, country clubs, and recreation centers that we believe appeal to this category of home buyers. We have integrated certain of these designs and features in some of our other home types and communities. As of October 31, 2019, we were selling from 39 active-adult communities, in which at least one home occupant must be at least 55 years of age. We expect to open additional active-adult communities during the next few years. 
As the millennial generation enters its prime family formation years, we continue to focus on this group with our core suburban homes, affordable luxury offerings, urban condominiums and luxury rental apartment products. 
We have developed and are developing, on our own or through joint ventures with third parties, a number of high-density, high-, mid- and low-rise urban luxury communities to serve a growing market of affluent move-up families, empty-nesters, and young professionals seeking to live in or close to major cities. These communities are currently marketed under our City Living brand. These communities, which we are currently developing or planning to develop on our own or through joint ventures, are located in Los Angeles, California; Bethesda, Maryland; Hoboken and Jersey City, New Jersey; the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Seattle, Washington. 
A majority of our City Living communities are high-rise projects and take an extended period of time to construct. We generally start selling homes in these communities after construction has commenced and, by the time construction has been completed, we typically have a significant number of homes in backlog. Once construction has been completed, the homes in backlog in these communities are generally delivered quickly. 
We believe that the demographics supporting the luxury first-time, move-up, empty-nester, active-adult, affordable luxury and second-home upscale markets will provide us with an opportunity for growth in the future. We continue to believe that many of our communities are in desirable locations that are difficult to replace and that many of these communities have substantial embedded value that may be realized in the future.
At October 31, 2019, we were selling homes from 333 communities, compared to 315 communities at October 31, 2018, and 305 communities at October 31, 2017.

City Living | 5 | | 4 | | 948 | | 589 | | 112 | 247 
Total | 383 | | 333 | | 47,654 | | 23,894 | | 6,266 | 17,494

At October 31, 2019, significant site improvements had not yet commenced on approximately 7,000 of the 17,494 available home sites. Of the 17,494 available home sites, approximately 1,700 were not yet owned by us but were controlled through options. 
Of our 383 operating communities at October 31, 2019, a total of 333 communities were offering homes for sale; 48 communities were sold out but not all homes had been completed and delivered; and two communities had been temporarily shut down and are expected to reopen in fiscal 2020. Of the 333 communities in which homes were being offered for sale at October 31, 2019, a total of 270 were detached home communities and 63 were attached home communities. 
At October 31, 2019, we had 1,120 homes (exclusive of model homes) under construction or completed but not under contract in our traditional communities, of which 745 were in detached home communities and 375 were in attached home communities. At October 31, 2019, we had 364 homes (exclusive of model homes) under construction or completed but not under contract in four City Living communities that were wholly owned. 
As a result of our wide product and geographic diversity, we have a wide range of base sales prices. The general range of base sales prices for our different lines of homes at October 31, 2019 was as follows:

Traditional Home Building Product | | | 
Detached homes | | | 
Move-up | $ | 230,000 | | to | $ | 792,000 
Executive | 335,000 | | to | 1,543,000 | 
Estate | 320,000 | | to | 3,010,000 | 
Active-adult | 317,000 | | to | 723,000 | 
Attached homes | | | 
Flats | $ | 262,000 | | to | $ | 1,683,000
Townhomes/Carriage homes | 292,000 | | to | 1,480,000 | 
Active-adult | 274,000 | | to | 840,000 | 
City Living Product | $ | 413,000 | | to | $ | 7,175,000

In fiscal 2019, of the 8,107 homes delivered, 21% had a delivered price of less than $500,000; 35% had a delivered price of between $500,000 and $750,000; 20% had a delivered price of between $750,000 and $1,000,000; 18% had a delivered price of between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000; and 6% had a delivered price of over $2,000,000. Of the homes delivered in fiscal 2019, approximately 22% of our home buyers paid the full purchase price in cash; the remaining home buyers borrowed approximately 68% of the value of the home.

The table below provides the average value of options purchased by our home buyers, including lot premiums, and the value of the options as a percent of the base selling price of the homes purchased in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017:

 | 2019 | | 2018 | 2017 
 | Option value (in thousands) | | Percent of base selling price | Option value (in thousands) | | Percent of base selling price | | Option value (in thousands) | Percent of base selling price
Overall | $ | 178 | | 24.4 | % | | $ | 165 | | 22.8 | % | $ | 152 | 22.0 | %
Traditional Home Building Product | | | | | | | | | 
Detached | $ | 203 | | 26.6 | % | | $ | 189 | | 24.8 | % | $ | 178 | 24.9 | %
Attached | $ | 99 | | 18.8 | % | | $ | 94 | | 19.6 | % | $ | 77 | 16.7 | %
City Living Product | $ | 31 | | 2.5 | % | | $ | 25 | | 1.3 | % | $ | 32 | 2.2 | %

In general, our attached homes and City Living products do not offer significant structural options to our home buyer and thus they have a smaller option value as a percentage of base selling price.

Land Policy
Before entering into an agreement to purchase a land parcel, we complete extensive comparative studies and analyses that assist us in evaluating the acquisition. In addition to purchasing land parcels outright, we often attempt to enter into option agreements to purchase land for future communities. We have also entered into several joint ventures with other builders or developers to develop land for the use of the joint venture participants or for sale to third parties. 
Our business is subject to many risks, including risks associated with obtaining the necessary approvals on a property and completing the land improvements on it. In order to reduce the financial risk associated with land acquisitions and holdings and to more efficiently manage our capital, where practicable, we enter into option agreements (also referred to herein as “land purchase contracts,” “purchase agreements,” or “options”) to purchase land, on a non-recourse basis, thereby limiting our financial exposure to amounts expended in obtaining any necessary governmental approvals, the costs incurred in the planning and design of the community, and, in some cases, some or all of the cost of the option (the deposit). Option agreements enable us to obtain necessary governmental approvals before we acquire title to the land, and allow us to acquire lots over a specified period of time at pre-determined prices. The use of these agreements may increase our overall cost basis in the land that we eventually acquire, but reduces our risk by allowing us to obtain the necessary development approvals before acquiring the land or allowing us to delay the acquisition to a later date. Historically, as approvals were obtained, the value of the purchase agreements and land generally increased; however, in any given time period, this may not happen. We have the ability to extend some of these purchase agreements for varying periods of time, in some cases by making an additional payment and, in other cases, without making any additional payment. Our purchase agreements are typically subject to numerous conditions, including, but not limited to, the ability to obtain necessary governmental approvals for the proposed community. Our deposit under an agreement may be returned to us if all approvals are not obtained, although predevelopment costs usually will not be recoverable. We generally have the right to cancel any of our agreements to purchase land by forfeiture of some or all of the deposits we have made pursuant to the agreement. 
During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we acquired control of approximately 13,900 and 13,400 home sites, respectively, net of options terminated and lots sold. At October 31, 2019, we controlled approximately 59,200 home sites, as compared to approximately 53,400 home sites at October 31, 2018, and approximately 48,300 home sites at October 31, 2017. 
We are developing several parcels of land for master planned communities in which we intend to build homes on a portion of the lots and sell the remaining lots to other builders. Two of these master planned communities are being developed 100% by us, and the remaining communities are being developed through joint ventures with other builders or financial partners. At October 31, 2019, our Land Development Joint Ventures owned approximately 10,100 home sites. At October 31, 2019, we had agreed to acquire 130 home sites and expect to purchase approximately 2,500 additional home sites from several of our Land Development Joint Ventures over a number of years. 
Our ability to continue development activities over the long term will be dependent upon, among other things, a suitable economic environment and our continued ability to locate and enter into options or agreements to purchase land, obtain 
5

governmental approvals for suitable parcels of land, and consummate the acquisition and complete the development of such land.
The following is a summary of home sites for future communities that we either owned or controlled through options or purchase agreements at October 31, 2019, as distinguished from our operating communities:

 | Number of communities | Number of home sites
Traditional Home Building: | | 
North | 41 | | 3,769 
Mid-Atlantic | 51 | | 3,992 
South | 89 | | 8,976 
West | 102 | | 12,628
California | 41 | | 5,154 
Traditional Home Building | 324 | | 34,519
City Living | 8 | | 951 
Total | 332 | | 35,470

Of the 35,470 planned home sites at October 31, 2019, we owned 14,466 and controlled 21,004 through options and purchase agreements. 
At October 31, 2019, the aggregate purchase price of land parcels subject to option and purchase agreements in operating communities and future communities was approximately $2.36 billion (including $10.8 million of land to be acquired from joint ventures in which we have invested). Of the $2.36 billion of land purchase commitments, we paid or deposited $168.8 million, and, if we acquire all of these land parcels, we will be required to pay an additional $2.19 billion. The purchases of these land parcels are expected to occur over the next several years. We have additional land parcels under option that have been excluded from the aforementioned aggregate purchase price since we do not believe that we will complete the purchase of these land parcels and no additional funds will be required from us to terminate these contracts. These option contracts have either been written off or written down to the estimated amount that we expect to recover when the contracts are terminated.
We have a substantial amount of land currently under control for which approvals have been obtained or are being sought. We devote significant resources to locating suitable land for future development and obtaining the required approvals on land under our control. There can be no assurance that the necessary development approvals will be secured for the land currently under our control or for land that we may acquire control of in the future or that, upon obtaining such development approvals, we will elect to complete the purchases of land under option or complete the development of land that we own. We generally have been successful in obtaining governmental approvals in the past. We believe that we have an adequate supply of land in our existing communities and proposed communities (assuming that all properties are developed) to maintain our operations at current levels for several years. 
Community Development
We typically expend considerable effort in developing a concept for each community, which includes determining the size, style, and price range of the homes; the layout of the streets and individual home sites; and the overall community design. After the necessary governmental subdivision and other approvals have been obtained, which may take several years, we improve the land by clearing and grading it; installing roads, underground utility lines, recreational amenities, and distinctive entrance features; and staking out individual home sites.
We act as a general contractor for most of our projects. Subcontractors perform all home construction and land development work, generally under fixed-price contracts. We generally have multiple sources for the materials we purchase, and we have not experienced significant delays due to unavailability of necessary materials. See “Manufacturing/Distribution Facilities” in Item 2 of this Form 10-K.
Our construction managers coordinate subcontracting activities and supervise all aspects of construction work and quality control. One of the ways in which we seek to achieve home buyer satisfaction is by providing our construction managers with incentive compensation arrangements based upon each home buyer’s satisfaction, as expressed by the buyers’ responses on pre- and post-closing questionnaires.
The most significant variable affecting the timing of our revenue stream, other than housing demand, is the opening of the community for sale, which generally occurs shortly after receipt of final land regulatory approvals. Receipt of approvals 
permits us to begin the process of obtaining executed sales contracts from home buyers. Although our sales and construction activities vary somewhat by season, which can affect the timing of closings, any such seasonal effect is relatively insignificant compared to the effect of the timing of receipt of final regulatory approvals, the opening of the community, and the subsequent timing of closings.
Marketing and Sales
We believe that our marketing strategy for our Traditional Home Building Product lines of homes, has enhanced our reputation as a builder and developer of high quality upscale homes. We believe this reputation results in greater demand for all of our lines of homes. We generally include attractive decorative features even in our less expensive homes, based on our belief that these enhancements improve our marketing and sales effort.
In determining the prices for our homes, we utilize, in addition to management’s extensive experience, an internally developed value analysis program that compares our homes with homes offered by other builders in each local marketing area. In our application of this program, we assign a positive or negative dollar value to differences between our product features and those of our competitors, such as house and community amenities, location, and reputation.
We typically have a sales office in each community that is staffed by our own sales personnel. Sales personnel are generally compensated with both salary and commission. A significant portion of our sales is also derived from the introduction of customers to our communities by local real estate agents.
We expend great effort and cost in designing and decorating our model homes, which play an important role in our marketing. Interior decorating varies among the models and is carefully selected to reflect the lifestyles of prospective buyers. 
Visitors to our website, www.TollBrothers.com, can obtain detailed information regarding our communities and homes across the country, take panoramic or video tours of our homes, and design their own home based upon our available floor plans and options. We also advertise in newspapers, in other local and regional publications, and on billboards and online media sites. 
We have a two-step sales process. The first step takes place when a potential home buyer visits one of our communities and decides to purchase one of our homes, at which point the home buyer signs a non-binding deposit agreement and provides a small, refundable deposit. This deposit will reserve, for a short period of time, the home site or unit that the home buyer has selected. This deposit also locks in the base price of the home. Because these deposit agreements are non-binding, they are not recorded as signed contracts, nor are they recorded in backlog. Deposit rates are tracked on a weekly basis to help us monitor the strength or weakness in demand in each of our communities. If demand for homes in a particular community is strong, we determine whether the base selling prices in that community should be increased. If demand for the homes in a particular community is weak, we determine whether or not sales incentives and/or discounts on home prices should be adjusted. 
The second step in the sales process occurs when we sign a binding agreement of sale with the home buyer and the home buyer gives us a cash down payment that is generally non-refundable. Cash down payments currently average approximately 7% of the total purchase price of a home. Between the time that the home buyer signs the non-binding deposit agreement and the binding agreement of sale, he or she is required to complete a financial questionnaire that gives us the ability to evaluate whether the home buyer has the financial resources necessary to purchase the home. If we determine that the home buyer is not financially qualified, we will not enter into an agreement of sale with the home buyer. During fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, our customers signed net contracts for $6.71 billion (8,075 homes), $7.60 billion (8,519 homes), and $6.83 billion (8,175 homes), respectively. When we report net contracts signed, the number and value of contracts signed are reported net of all cancellations occurring during the reporting period, whether signed in that reporting period or in a prior period. Only outstanding agreements of sale that have been signed by both the home buyer and us as of the end of the period for which we are reporting are included in backlog. 
Customer Mortgage Financing
We maintain relationships with a widely-diversified group of mortgage financial institutions, many of which are among the largest in the industry. We believe that regional and community banks continue to recognize the long-term value in creating relationships with affluent customers such as our home buyers, and these banks continue to provide these customers with financing. We believe that our home buyers generally are, and should continue to be, better able to secure mortgages due to their typically lower loan-to-value ratios and attractive credit profiles, as compared to the average home buyer. 
Our mortgage subsidiary provides mortgage financing for a portion of our home closings. Our mortgage subsidiary determines whether the home buyer qualifies for the mortgage that he or she is seeking based upon information provided by the home buyer and other sources. For those home buyers who qualify, our mortgage subsidiary provides the home buyer with a mortgage commitment that specifies the terms and conditions of a proposed mortgage loan based upon then-current market conditions. 
Information about the number and amount of loans funded by our mortgage subsidiary is contained in the table below.

Fiscal year | TotalToll Brothers, Inc. settlements(a) | TBI Mortgage Companyfinanced settlements*(b) | | Grosscapture rate (b/a) | Amountfinanced (in millions)
2019 | 8,107 | | 3,259 | | 40.2% | $ | 1,572.1
2018 | 8,265 | | 2,918 | | 35.3% | $ | 1,411.6
2017 | 7,151 | | 2,407 | | 33.7% | $ | 1,168.4
2016 | 6,098 | | 2,523 | | 41.4% | $ | 1,240.9
2015 | 5,525 | | 2,103 | | 38.1% | $ | 1,001.2


* | Amounts under “TBI Mortgage Company financed settlements” exclude brokered and referred loans, which amounted to approximately 4.0%, 5.0%, 3.6%, 4.2%, and 6.2%, of our home closings in fiscal 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

Prior to the actual closing of the home and funding of the mortgage, the home buyer may lock in an interest rate based upon the terms of the commitment. At the time of rate lock, our mortgage subsidiary agrees to sell the proposed mortgage loan to one of several outside recognized mortgage financing institutions (“investors”) that are willing to honor the terms and conditions, including the interest rate, committed to the home buyer. We believe that these investors have adequate financial resources to honor their commitments to our mortgage subsidiary. At October 31, 2019, our mortgage subsidiary was committed to fund $1.93 billion of mortgage loans. Of these commitments, $565.6 million, as well as $208.6 million of mortgage loans receivable, have “locked-in” interest rates as of October 31, 2019. Our mortgage subsidiary funds its commitments through a combination of its own capital, capital provided from us, its loan facility, and the sale of mortgage loans to various investors. Our mortgage subsidiary has commitments from investors to acquire all $774.2 million of these locked-in loans and receivables. Our home buyers have not locked in the interest rate on the remaining $1.36 billion of mortgage loan commitments as of October 31, 2019.
Backlog
We had a backlog of $5.26 billion (6,266 homes) at October 31, 2019; $5.52 billion (6,105 homes) at October 31, 2018; and $5.06 billion (5,851 homes) at October 31, 2017. Of the 6,266 homes in backlog at October 31, 2019, approximately 93% are expected to be delivered by October 31, 2020.
Competition
The home building business is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with numerous home builders of varying sizes, ranging from local to national in scope, some of which have greater sales and financial resources than we do. Sales of existing homes also provide competition. We compete primarily on the basis of price, location, design, quality, service, and reputation. We believe our financial stability, relative to many others in our industry, is a favorable competitive factor. 
Investments in Unconsolidated Entities
We have investments in various unconsolidated entities. These entities include Land Development Joint Ventures, Home Building Joint Ventures, Rental Property Joint Ventures, and Gibraltar Joint Ventures. At October 31, 2019, we had investments of $366.3 million in these unconsolidated entities and were committed to invest or advance up to an additional $38.8 million to these entities if they require additional funding.

Land Development Joint Ventures
At October 31, 2019, we have investments in eight Land Development Joint Ventures to develop land. Some of these Land Development Joint Ventures develop land for the sole use of the venture participants, including us, and others develop land for sale to the joint venture participants and to unrelated builders. At October 31, 2019, we had approximately $110.3 million invested in our Land Development Joint Ventures and funding commitments of $28.6 million to two of the Land Development Joint Ventures which will be funded if additional investments in the ventures are required.

At October 31, 2019, we had agreed to acquire 130 home sites from one of our Land Development Joint Ventures for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $10.8 million. In addition, we expect to purchase approximately 2,500 additional home sites over a number of years from several of these joint ventures. The purchase prices of these home sites will be determined at a future date.
Home Building Joint Ventures
At October 31, 2019, we had an aggregate of $60.5 million of investments in four Home Building Joint Ventures to develop approximately 100 luxury for-sale homes. At October 31, 2019, we had $1.4 million of funding commitments to one of these joint ventures. In fiscal 2019, the value of net contracts signed by our Home Building Joint Ventures was $131.0 million (40 homes), and they delivered $374.6 million (186 homes) of revenue. At October 31, 2019, our Home Building Joint Ventures had a backlog of undelivered homes of $76.3 million (26 homes).
Rental Property Joint Ventures
As part of our strategy to diversify product lines, over the past several years, we acquired control of a number of land parcels as for-rent apartment projects, including several student housing sites. At October 31, 2019, we had an aggregate of $174.3 million of investments in 20 Rental Property Joint Ventures. At October 31, 2019, we or joint ventures in which we have an interest controlled 56 land parcels as for-rent apartment projects containing approximately 18,300 units. At October 31, 2019, joint ventures in which we had an interest had aggregate loan commitments of $1.39 billion and outstanding borrowings against these commitments of $1.02 billion.These projects are located in multiple metropolitan areas throughout the country and are being operated or developed (or we expect will be developed) with partners under the brand names Toll Brothers Apartment Living and Toll Brothers Campus Living. 
In fiscal 2019, one of our Rental Property Joint Ventures, located in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, sold its assets to an unrelated party for $77.8 million. From our investment in this joint venture, we received cash of $7.4 million and recognized a gain from this sale of $3.8 million in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2018, three of our Rental Property Joint Ventures sold their assets to unrelated parties for $477.5 million. These joint ventures had owned, developed, and operated multifamily rental properties located in suburban Washington, D.C. and Westborough, Massachusetts, and a student housing community in College Park, Maryland. From our investment in these joint ventures, we received cash of $79.1 million and recognized gains from these sales of $67.2 million in fiscal 2018. The gains recognized from these sales are included in “Income from unconsolidated entities” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income included in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K.
At October 31, 2019, we had approximately 2,000 units in for-rent apartment projects that were occupied or ready for occupancy, 1,700 units in the lease-up stage, 8,400 units in the design phase or under development, and 6,200 units in the planning stage. Of the 18,300 units at October 31, 2019, 7,700 were owned by joint ventures in which we have an interest; approximately 4,400 were owned by us; and 6,200 were under contract to be purchased by us.
Gibraltar Joint Ventures
Over the past three years, we, through Gibraltar, entered into several ventures with an institutional investor to provide builders and developers with land banking and venture capital. We have approximately a 25% interest in these ventures. These ventures will finance builders’ and developers’ acquisition and development of land and home sites and pursue other complementary investment strategies. We may invest up to $100.0 million in these ventures. As of October 31, 2019, we had an investment of $20.5 million in these ventures.
Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to various local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction, and similar matters, including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements. In a number of our markets, there has been an increase in state and local legislation authorizing the acquisition of land as dedicated open space, mainly by governmental, quasi-public, and nonprofit entities. In addition, we are subject to various licensing, registration, and filing requirements in connection with the construction, advertisement, and sale of homes in our communities. The impact of these laws and requirements has been to increase our overall costs, and they may have delayed, and in the future may delay, the opening of communities, or may have caused, and in the future may cause, us to conclude that development of particular communities would not be economically feasible, even if any or all necessary governmental approvals were obtained. See “Land Policy” in this Item 1. We also may be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums in one or more of the areas in which we operate. Generally, such moratoriums often relate to insufficient water or sewage facilities or inadequate road capacity.
In order to secure certain approvals in some areas, we may be required to provide affordable housing at below market rental or sales prices. The impact of these requirements on us depends on how the various state and local governments in the areas in 
which we engage, or intend to engage, in development implement their programs for affordable housing. To date, these restrictions have not had a material impact on us.
We also are subject to a variety of local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning protection of public health and the environment (“environmental laws”). The particular environmental laws that apply to any given community vary according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site. Complying with these environmental laws may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and/or may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas.
Before consummating an acquisition, we generally engage independent environmental consultants to evaluate land for the potential of hazardous or toxic materials, wastes, or substances, and we believe that because of this, we have not been significantly affected to date by the presence of such materials on our land.
Our mortgage subsidiary is subject to various state and federal statutes, rules, and regulations, including those that relate to licensing, lending operations, and other areas of mortgage origination and financing. The impact of those statutes, rules, and regulations can be to increase our home buyers’ cost of financing, increase our cost of doing business, and restrict our home buyers’ access to some types of loans.
Insurance/Warranty
All of our homes are sold under our limited warranty as to workmanship and mechanical equipment. Many homes also come with a limited multi-year warranty as to structural integrity. 
We maintain insurance, subject to deductibles and self-insured amounts, to protect us against various risks associated with our activities, including, among others, general liability, “all-risk” property, construction defects, workers’ compensation, automobile, and employee fidelity. We accrue for our expected costs associated with the deductibles and self-insured amounts.
Employees
At October 31, 2019, we employed approximately 5,100 persons full-time. At October 31, 2019, we were subject to one collective bargaining agreement that covered less than 2% of our employees. We believe our employee relations are good.
