Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------


 
  The Company was formed in 2008 as an alternative energy research and development company. During much of its history the Company had designed solar monitoring and charging systems which were discontinued in 2016 to focus on developing point-of-care diagnostic devices. The Company has recently added to the scope of its activities efforts to produce, market and sell products made from industrial hemp containing cannabidiol (CBD).
  
  Our efforts are presently focused on organizational activities. Until we are fully-funded, we will be dependent upon assistance provided by our largest shareholder, Ceed2Med, LLC (“C2M”). We intend to enter into a Management and Services Agreement with C2M for assistance such as general oversight, product development, sales and marketing. C2M has provided and will continue to provide personnel necessary for our growth. Utilizing C2M employees and facilities we have been able to rapidly access resources and opportunities in the hemp-derived CBD industry. C2M personnel have been involved in hemp-related businesses since 2014. Our President, Emiliano Aloi, is a well-recognized expert and also serves in an executive capacity at C2M. Our Chief Executive, Philip Young, is a seasoned and knowledgeable pharmaceutical executive. Loss of either of these executives could have a material adverse effect on our business. Maintaining a strong relationship with C2M is a material factor in our efforts to successfully establish ourselves in this emerging business sector.
  
 On January 8, 2019 we began pursuing hemp-derived CBD as new business segment after passage of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, also known as the 2018 Farm Bill. The 2018 Farm Bill declassified industrial hemp as a Schedule I substance, shifted regulatory authority from the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Department of Agriculture, and provided autonomy for states to regulate the industry. The 2018 Farm Bill did not change the Food and Drug Administration’s oversight authority over CBD products. The 2018 Farm Bill defined industrial hemp as a variety of cannabis containing an amount equal to or lower than 0.3% tetra-hydrocannabinol (THC) and allowed farmers to grow and sell hemp under state regulation. Industry reports indicate that 41 states have set up cultivation and production programs to regulate the production of hemp.
  
 Following passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, we entered into a Master Product Development and Supply Agreement (the “Master Agreement”) with C2M. Under the Master Agreement, C2M agreed to provide us up to 2,500 kilograms of products (isolate or distillate) for manufacture into consumer products such as tinctures, edibles, capsules, topical solutions and animal health products and in February 2019 we received our first trial order. Our principle focus is intended to be on the health, nutrition and medical communities, principally focusing on the interests of physicians, pharmacies and healthcare providers. We believe that these professionals often address unmet needs of patients and would like to provide information on alternatives to traditional treatments involving potential use of hemp-based products. We believe that physicians, pharmacists and healthcare providers alike are suited to assist patients with information and to assist with dosage and monitoring patient use. Little or no empirical data exists on these issues and generally recognized peer reviewed scientific studies are yet to be available. Similarly, the FDA has not adopted regulations governing the use of hemp-based CBD specifically, but is expected to do so.
  
 We believe manufacturing, testing and quality akin to pharmaceutical products is important when distributing hemp-based products. Our products originate from farms at which we (or C2M) oversee all stages of plant growth and are manufactured in cGMP facilities1 following pharmaceutical drug manufacturing norms. To this end, we have designed and plan to include on our product labels readable QR codes that trace ingredients all the way from the seed (the farm) to the bottle or end product. We provide 3d party laboratory testing results at various points in the supply-chain and material data safety sheets accessible through each QR code label.
  
 In 2019 and beyond, we expect to be in position to control our own farm production of raw material (biomass) from hemp grown on our own farms in Oregon, which consist of two farms of approximately 100 acres each located in the Rogue Valley and the Illinois Valley, respectively. In March 2019, we acquired a 50.1% interest in our subsidiary Exactus One World, LLC (“Exactus One World”) owned with an experienced farming partner. We believe that superior yield, while never assured, can be optimized with appropriate farming techniques starting with genetic selection (seed). To this end, we have contracted with Oregon CBD for our seed. Oregon CBD’s expertise in industrial hemp seed research and development (www.oregoncbdseeds.com) comes from 30 years of combined cannabis production and policy experience of its founders Seth and Eric Crawford2. Our farm partners are highly experienced growers in the Illinois Valley and Rogue Valley regions of Oregon, and have developed proprietary techniques for soil preparation and harvest, and patent-pending techniques for drying, all of which are key components in producing valuable hemp crops.
  
 1 cGMP refers to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations enforced by the FDA. cGMP standards ensure systems for proper design, monitoring, and control of manufacturing processes and facilities are employed. cGMP is and will be a major challenge as the industrial hemp industry matures. Since shortages and uncertainty over reliable raw material availability are paramount to becoming a reliable provider, our initial focus is on establishing relationships with cGMP vendors.

  Exactus One World is our name for our farming and production initiative because it captures the expansive and inclusive nature of our vision for a comprehensive seed to consumer program. We will farm and process our own industrial hemp to be manufactured into cannabidiol (CBD) related products using, as much as possible, our own facilities and cGMP resources at every step of the supply chain.
  
  Recent developments -
  
 On March 6, 2019 we placed a pre-paid $1,000,000 order for products from C2M.
  
 On March 11, 2019 we acquired 50.1% of Exactus One World, LLC.
  
 On March 15, 2019 we shipped our first product order to a 1,000+ store distributor in Las Vegas, Nevada.
  
 On March 20, 2019 we entered into agreements to acquire Tierra Healthcare Concepts, LLC (“Tierra”), a Florida limited liability company, and CannacareMD, LLC (“Cannacare”), a Florida limited liability company. Through existing networks of physicians and websites Tierra and Cannacare intend to assist doctors to educate consumers about CBD, and to offer our own “Hemp Healthy” brand hemp products through online stores (www.buyhempcbd.com).
  
 During late March 2019, we expect to begin receiving deliveries of our Hemp Healthy branded tinctures, gel caps, and vapes to be offered through Tierra and CannacareMD and online.
  
 We have commenced a search for director of marketing and sales, leased facilities, and intend to commence direct selling activities during the second quarter of 2019 from call centers located in Florida. We are actively seeking to acquire existing businesses engaged in the offer and sale of hemp-based products to consumers and for animal health and have identified and met with several targets with revenues from $100,000 to $1,000,000 per month.
  
  Cannabidiol (CBD) Products -
  
  Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of several phyto-cannabinoids discovered in 1940. It is one of at least 113 cannabinoids identified in hemp plants, accounting for up to 40% of the plant's extract.
  
  Since December 2018, our efforts have been focused on identifying relationships and pursuing opportunities to develop a business in marketing and selling hemp-based products in a variety of forms to a range of market sectors. The Company has no prior experience in this rapidly evolving segment. CBD is derived from industrial hemp and, because of its low THC content, is lawful in the United States and has no measurable psychoactive effects. High quality raw materials made from hemp are essential to produce the isolates and distillates used to produce products. Industrial hemp is defined as plants with less than 0.3% of the psychoactive compound THC found in cannabis plants.
  
  Our goal is to establish relationships that will provide availability of supply of raw materials and finished products and to expand our skills by aligning with committed partners who have the requisite expertise to allow us to rapidly launch a business in hemp-based products. As we develop this business, we perceive there to be many challenges to our success. One of the early challenges to success is procuring adequate supply of precursor materials to support wholesale and retail demand. Since we believe access to supply or quality products for human and animal consumption will be highly regulated, production to Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) standards is of the utmost importance as regulation increases.
  
  C2M Master Product Development and Supply Agreement -
  
  On January 8, 2019 we entered into a Master Product Development and Supply Agreement (the “Development Agreement”) with C2M. C2M utilizes cGMP facilities and has the expertise, resources, skills and experience suitable for production of active phyto-cannabinoid (CBD) rich ingredients including isolates, distillates, water soluble, and proprietary formulations. Under the Agreement, we have been allotted a minimum of 50 and up to 300 kilograms per month, and up to 2,500 kilograms annually, of active phyto-cannabinoid (CBD) rich ingredients for resale. We are able to offer tinctures, edibles, capsules, topical solutions and animal health products manufactured for us by C2M to satisfy demand for branded and white-label products that we intend to offer to sell. We began marketing during the first quarter of 2019. C2M is seeking to continually advance CBD technology and has established relationships in order to be able to continue to provide innovative new solutions, including water soluble solutions intended to be offered in the future. The founders of C2M established their first CBD business in 2014. C2M was issued approximately 8.4 million shares of our common stock on January 8, 2019. As a result, C2M is our largest shareholder holding approximately 23% of our fully diluted capital stock.
  
  Our relationship with C2M provides us with access to the skills and experience of seasoned advisors with over four years of experience with industrial hemp. C2M has well-established relationships with leading companies in genetics (seed), farming, processing, manufacturing, testing, and distribution and warehouse and processing facilities within this supply chain. C2M has farmed industrial hemp in Oregon and Kentucky, among other places.

  Exactus One World Subscription Agreement and Membership Purchase Agreement –
  
  On March 11, 2019 the Company’s board of directors approved the acquisition of a 50.1% limited liability membership interest in Exactus One World, LLC (“EOW”), an Oregon limited liability company, pursuant to a subscription agreement (the “One World Subscription Agreement”) and a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”). 
  
  Exactus One World will farm and process industrial hemp into CBD and related products.  EOW is a newly-formed limited liability company that will be responsible for the Company’s initial efforts to pursue agricultural development, including farm soil preparation, planting, harvesting, transportation and drying.  EOW has leased two farms of approximately 100 acres each located in the Rogue Valley and the Illinois Valley, respectively, where the Company expects to establish a farming operation for the 2019 grow season.  EOW has also placed an order for seeds (genetics) from Oregon CBD (“OC”). OC, founded by Seth and Eric Crawford, is believed to have developed superior strains of hemp seeds and is believed by the Company to be one of the world’s leading breeding, research and production facilities for CBD seed. Crawford Brothers facilities are located in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. EOW will be farming in the area of Cave Junction, Oregon. The Company will be responsible for funding and the minority owners will be responsible for management, servicing and operating the farm properties.
  
  Pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreement for EOW, the Company will make payments of $2.7 million through October 1, 2019 to support costs for farming for the 2019 harvest.  The leases are subject to annual renewal at the option of Exactus One World.  The Company may become obligated for additional expenses, including capital calls required by the manager, if necessary, to complete the 2019 harvest depending upon, among other things, greater than expected yields or unexpected costs of operations.  The 2019 cost estimate and subscription payment amount was based upon an assumed yield of 2,200 pounds per acre, and is subject to assumptions and estimates, as well as risks, associated with any farming operation, and farming of hemp in particular.
  
  Under the terms of the Subscription Agreement the Company acquired a 30% interest in Exactus One World and an additional 20.1% was acquired from existing members pursuant to the terms of a Purchase Agreement. The sellers agreed to a purchase price for 20.1% of EOW for payment of $1.5 million in cash plus $1.5 million in the Company’s restricted common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”).  Upon execution of the Purchase Agreement, the Company is required to pay $300,000 cash and 937,500 shares of Common Stock to the sellers, and on each of April 20, 2019 and September 1, 2019, the Company is required to make additional payments of $700,000 and $500,000, respectively, in cash to the sellers.  In addition, on June 10, 2019, the Company is required to issue the sellers an additional $450,000 of restricted Common Stock of the Company based upon the 20 day volume weighted average price per share on the date of issue.
  
  Under the terms of the EOW Operating Agreement (the “Operating Agreement”), the sellers will appoint a sole manager and shall be responsible for all decisions other than specified decisions requiring a super majority (66.67%) vote of the members.  The duration of the limited liability company is perpetual.  Under certain circumstances, the manager may make capital calls at which time 30% of such capital call will required to be paid by the Company.  If not paid, such capital call failure can result in reduction of the Company’s ownership interest in the limited liability company.  The Operating Agreement provides the members and managers with certain rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses, in certain circumstances.  All members constitute a single class and vote in accordance with their percentage interest, however the manager shall conduct the day to day affairs of the limited liability company.  Distributions from the limited liability company will be determined by the manager, subject to mandatory annual distribution in the estimated amount of taxes required to be paid by the members.
  
  Industrial Hemp -
  
  We seek to take advantage of an emerging worldwide trend to utilize the production of industrial hemp in consumer products. Hemp is being used today in cosmetics, nutritional supplements, and animal feed, where we also intend to focus our efforts. The market for hemp-derived products is expected to increase substantially over the next five years, and we are endeavoring to prepare the Company to be positioned as a significant player in the industry. According to industry reports, CBD is expected to conservatively generate sales of $16 billion by 2025. In one survey, nearly 7% (of 2,500 respondents) reported using CBD as a supplement in January 2019, with retail sales of CBD consumer products in 2018 estimated as being only between $600 million and $2 billion.
  
  According to the report, cannabis’ therapeutic potential is attributable to the valuable overlap between phyto-cannabinoids (i.e. plant-derived cannabinoids) and the endogenous cannabinoid system in humans, termed a “therapeutic handshake”. Clinical trial results to date demonstrate few adverse effects from oral CBD doses of up to 1,500 mg/day or up to 30 mg IV. The scientific understanding of CBD’s clinical effects is based mostly on studies in specific indications, like epilepsy. GW Pharma’s Epidiolex (a highly potent, pure formulation of CBD) was approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, and other companies have clinical trials underway in seizure disorders.

  We expect to realize revenue through our efforts, if successful, to sell wholesale and retail finished products to third parties. However, as we are in a start-up phase in a new business venture in a rapidly evolving industry, many of our costs and challenges are new and unknown. In order to fund our activities, we will need to raise additional capital either through the issuance of equity and/or the issuance of debt. In the event we are unsuccessful in raising sufficient additional capital to fund our efforts, we may need to curtail, abandon or delay our plans to enter into this segment.
  
  Healthcare –
  
  CBD products appear to be gaining traction with independent pharmacies. The industry, including the Company, has also been approached by several large chain pharmacies with inquiries concerning sourcing, quality, accountability and volume. According to the report, pharmacies likely find the high-margin profile of CBD attractive, similar to over-the-counter drugs. We believe pharmacies will appreciate our “seed-to-consumer” approach and our cGMP manufacturing focus and our planned QR Code traceability and reporting.
  
  Currently, CBD products are not a covered benefit, or an extra benefit, under managed care, insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or any state programs. This will likely continue to be the case for the intermediate term. Legal issues and confusion concerning legality, lack of FDA regulation and availability as an OTC medication will likely continue for an indefinite period impeding adoption and payor acceptance.
  
  Competition -
  
  We believe a multitude (hundreds) of companies, large and small, including mom and pops, have launched or intend to launch retail brands and white label products containing CBD. Many of these are offering CBD and are dependent upon third parties to provide raw material inventory for sale. We believe this makes many of the participants in the industry vulnerable to shortages, quality issues, reliability and pricing variability. While we also intend to pursue retail and white label strategies, we believe our relationship with C2M may provide supply chain efficiencies that will put us among the few companies that maintain a competitive pricing and supply advantage, poised for revenue growth during 2019 and beyond, and that our farming initiative will also provide us a competitive advantage by reducing our reliance on third parties.
  
  The CBD-based consumer product industry is highly fragmented with numerous companies, many of which are under-capitalized. There are also large, well-funded companies that currently do not offer hemp-based consumer products including large agribusiness companies such as Cargill and Tyson Foods, but may do so in the future and become significant competitors.
  
  Our goal is to rapidly establish one or more principal sources of supply and to develop wholesale and retail sales channels for end-products, such as nutraceuticals, supplements and pet and farm products. We intend to follow regulatorily compliant pathways by adopting practices established by the FDA for CBD and to pursue FDA approval for our activities upon adoption of federal regulations, including conducting independent clinical and non-clinical trials.
  
  Companies such as CV Sciences, Inc. (OTCQB:CVSI) in the US and recent acquisitions by Canadian cannabis producers reflect the growing acceptance of CBD products as a lynchpin for growth. Transactions such as Tilray, Inc.3 (NASDAQ:TLRY-Manitoba Harvest $419 million February 2019), Level Brands, Inc.4 (NYSE:LEVB - Cure Based Development LLC December 2018), and Aurora Cannabis, Inc. (OTCQB:ACBFF–Agropro UAB EUR6.5 million)5 reflect the growing interest and M&A activity in the industry among our competition and increasing consolidation.
  
  Non-CBD Competition. We do not intend to offer and do not compete with companies that offer cannabis products containing high levels of psychoactive THC. Although legal in some states, and in Canada, we do not intend to enter into this market. We may offer our industrial-hemp based products in dispensaries, but will not compete with any medical or recreational marijuana sellers for high THC content sales due to legal and regulatory restrictions and uncertainty in the United States. Because of regulatory challenges facing marijuana companies in the United States, the vast majority of the companies focused on THC are Canadian and foreign, although several have begun to pursue domestic activities in states that permit marijuana sales. Federal law does not generally recognize marijuana (or hemp that exceeds 0.3% THC) as lawful, although that may change in the future. Because of these factors, our competitors that have focused exclusively on CBD are limited.

  Retail Competition. Many of our competitors are private companies and as a result, little or no reliable information is available. Of the publicly reporting companies, we believe many of the CBD companies are principally focused on high THC content marijuana.
  
  Retail Strategy -
  
  Our focus will include establishing wholesale and retail distribution by developing our own brands, selling white label branded products to others and making acquisitions of existing businesses engaged in marketing or sales, in both online and retail channels. We may supply to wholesalers, retailers, and distribution centers as we seek to launch our retail strategy. We intend to initially focus on developing products to reach medical and health communities to be sold or promoted by or through medical professionals such as internists, dermatologists, osteopaths, chiropractors, pharmacists, and other holistic or natural products purveyors, but will not be limited to such efforts. We intend to focus on higher margin opportunities utilizing online sales and sales in stores, offices or pharmacies.
  Source and Availability of Raw Materials -
  
  C2M has historically sourced raw materials from well-established and well-recognized hemp growers in the United States. C2M also maintains ownership positions in several farms. We have established access to C2M for their raw material supply, and continue to explore and develop other options to ensure that we can meet the expected demand for bulk hemp products well into the future. Accordingly, we are heavily reliant upon the continued success of C2M and our ability to maintain good relations with C2M in order to have a source of raw materials and opportunities to pursue our plans in the future. C2M is a recently formed privately-owned limited liability company and as a result limited information about C2M is available.
  Environmental Matters -
  
  Compliance with federal, state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had, nor are they expected to have, any direct material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, however such factors could indirectly affect us, and could affect C2M, as well as participants in the supply chain for our products, and our business, operations, vendors or suppliers.
  Point of Care Diagnostics -
  
  As previously reported under “Business” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the second segment of our business is the development of point of care diagnostic devices. We have since February 2016 been developing devices for measuring proteolytic enzymes in the blood, known as the FibriLyzer and collagenase levels in the blood, known as the MatriLyzer. We are considering seeking to obtain and evaluate technology that could also be useful in laboratory and field testing for CBD and THC levels, useful in the manufacture of CBD products. We believe our diagnostic business has been severely hampered by a shortage of capital for development and as a result our licenses for the underlying technology FibriLyzer and MatriLyzer technology have been threatened and may be discontinued. We have received notice of termination of certain of our licenses for non-payment of fees. For the past 9 months, we have been engaged in discussions with third-parties regarding funding and a possible third-party merger candidate to develop our diagnostic business. Accordingly, we have determined to continue to look for third-parties to partner with and/or buyers to invest in or acquire this business segment. If successful, we could sell or license our rights to third parties with substantially greater resources than us. We also may be required to terminate this segment and may not realize any benefit from our prior investment in developing this business.
 Employees
  
 As of December 31, 2018, we have 4 employees, all of which are full time.
