ITEM 1 | BUSINESS
-------+---------

 Overview   Glatfelter began operations in 1864, and over the past few years a key component of our strategy has been a focus on growing our engineered materials businesses. In connection with this strategy, in 2018 we divested the former Specialty Papers business unit, acquired Georgia Pacific’s European nonwovens business based in Steinfurt, Germany (“Steinfurt”) and completed the start-up of our new airlaid production facility in Fort Smith, Arkansas. As a leading global supplier of engineered materials for consumer and industrial applications, we maintain leading positions in key segments serving markets that are growing commensurate with or in excess of gross domestic product (“GDP”). We are headquartered in York, Pennsylvania, and our net sales approximate $950 million annually with customers in over 100 countries. Operations include eleven manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Philippines. Our business is managed as two separate business units: Composite Fibers and Advanced Airlaid Materials.
 We partner with leading consumer product companies and other market leaders to provide innovative solutions delivering outstanding performance to meet market requirements. Over the past several years, we have made investments to increase production capacity and improve our technical capabilities to ensure we are best positioned to serve the market demands and grow our revenue. We are committed to growing in our key markets and will make appropriate investments to support our customers and satisfy market demands.
 In the first quarter of 2018, we produced and delivered our first commercial shipment of Airlaid product from our new $90 million facility in Arkansas. This 20,000 metric-ton facility was built to meet the growing demands of the North American market. Throughout 2018, this facility continued to ramp up production and shipments of wipes and table top products. 
This investment together with the Steinfurt acquisition 

  increases our total global airlaid materials capacity to approximately 150,000 metric tons. 
 Our high-quality, innovative and customizable solutions are found in health and hygiene products, tea and single-serve coffee filtration, and other home, building, electrical, and industrial applications. Our goal is to be the global supplier of choice for innovation and solutions designed to meet the demands of our customers and the markets they serve. 
 Our goals are to maintain and grow our leading market positions, expand product margins, partner with customers to provide innovative solutions for new markets, and generate strong free cash flows. We are committed to ensuring our cost structure is competitive driven by delivering on cost reduction and continuous improvement initiatives to maintain our leading market positions. 
 Recent Developments On October 1, 2018, we acquired Georgia-Pacific’s European nonwovens business for $181 million.  The acquisition consisted of Georgia-Pacific’s operations located in Steinfurt, Germany, along with sales offices located in France and Italy. Steinfurt is a state-of-the-art, 32,000-metric-ton-capacity manufacturing facility that employs approximately 220 people.
 On October 31, 2018, we completed the sale of the Specialty Papers Business Unit to Pixelle Specialty Solutions LLC, an affiliate of Lindsay Goldberg, for $360 million. For financial reporting purposes, Specialty Papers is presented as a discontinued operation.

  COMPOSITE FIBERS   Our Composite Fibers business unit (“Composite Fibers” or “CFBU”) serves customers globally and focuses on higher value-added products in the following markets:
 
• | Food & Beverage filtration paper primarily used for single-serve coffee and tea products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wallcover base materials used by the world’s largest wallpaper manufacturers;

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe Composite Fibers maintains a market leadership position in the single-serve coffee and tea filtration markets, wallcover base material and many other products it produces. We believe many of the markets served by Composite Fibers present attractive growth opportunities due to evolving consumer preferences, new or emerging geographic markets, new product innovation and increased market share through superior products and quality. 
 This business unit’s revenue composition by market consisted of the following for the years indicated:
 
 
In thousands | 2018 | | 2017 | | | 2016 | 
----------------------+------+---------+------+---+---------+------+--
Food & beverage | $ | 279,515 | | $ | 268,474 | | $ | 258,463

Total | $ | 554,869 | | $ | 544,260 | | $ | 516,954

 A significant portion of this business unit’s revenue is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and therefore the comparison from period to period reflects the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Changes in exchange rates favorably affected the comparison of 2018 to 2017 by $18.9 million and by $2.0 million in the comparison of 2017 to 2016. 
 Composite Fibers business unit is comprised of five paper making facilities (Germany, France and England), two metallizing operations (Wales and Germany) and a 

  pulp mill (the Philippines). The combined attributes of the facilities are summarized as follows (in metric tons):
 
 
Production Capacity | Principal Raw Material (“PRM”) | Estimated Annual Quantity of PRM | 
---------------------------------------+--------------------------------+----------------------------------+-------
142,000 lightweight and other paper | Abaca pulp | | 15,800
 | Wood pulp | | 99,000
 | Synthetic fiber | | 24,400
21,600 metallized | Base stock | | 24,000
15,000 abaca pulp | Abaca fiber | | 23,400

 
Composite Fibers’ lightweight products are produced using highly specialized inclined wire paper machine technology.
 The primary raw materials used in the production of our lightweight papers are softwood pulps, abaca pulp, and other specialty fibers. Sufficient quantities of abaca pulp and its source, abaca fiber, are important to support growth in this business unit. Abaca pulp, a specialized pulp with limited sources of availability, is produced by our Philippine mill, providing a unique advantage to our Composite Fibers business unit. In the event the supply of abaca fiber becomes constrained or when production demands exceed the capacity of the Philippines mill, alternative sources and/or substitute fibers are used to meet customer demands.
 In addition to critical raw materials, Composite Fibers’ production cost is influenced by the price of electricity and natural gas. The business unit generates all of its steam needed for production by burning natural gas. However, in 2018 it purchased approximately 75% of its electricity needs the cost of which is influenced by the natural gas markets.
 In Composite Fibers’ markets, competition is product line specific as the necessity for technical expertise and specialized manufacturing equipment limits the number of companies offering multiple product lines. The following chart summarizes key competitors by market segment:
 
 
Market segment | Competitor 
--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Single serve coffee & tea | Ahlstrom, Purico, Miquel y Costas and Zhejiang Kan 
Wallcovering | Technocell, Neu Kaliss, Goznak, Kämmerer and Ahlstrom 
Technical specialties | Nippon Kodoshi Corp ("NKK"), Kan Kyo Technology, Burrows and Suominen Oyj 
Composite laminates | Schweitzer-Maudit, Purico, Miquel y Costas and Oi Feng 
Metallized | AR Metallizing, Torras Papel Novelis, Vaassen, Galileo Nanotech, and Wenzhou Protec Vacuum Metallizing Co.

ADVANCED AIRLAID MATERIALS   Our Advanced Airlaid Materials business unit (“Advanced Airlaid” or “AMBU”) is a leading global supplier of highly absorbent and very thin profile cellulose-based airlaid nonwoven materials primarily used to manufacture consumer products for growing global end-user markets. The markets served by Advanced Airlaid include:

• | feminine hygiene;
--+------------------


• | specialty wipes;
--+-----------------


• | table top;
--+-----------


• | adult incontinence;
--+--------------------


• | home care; and
--+---------------


• | other consumer products.
--+-------------------------

 AMBU’s customers are industry leading consumer product companies as well as private label converters. We believe this business unit holds leading market share positions in the majority of the markets it serves. Advanced Airlaid has developed long-term customer relationships through superior quality, customer service, and a reputation for quickly bringing product and process innovations to market.
 Advanced Airlaid Materials’ revenue composition by market consisted of the following for the years indicated:
 
 
In thousands | 2018 | | 2017 | | | 2016 | 
-------------------+------+---------+------+---+---------+------+--
Feminine hygiene | $ | 195,686 | | $ | 179,671 | | $ | 173,902
Specialty wipes | | 45,375 | | | 29,519 | | | 25,206 
Table top | | 21,600 | | | 6,707 | | | 6,718

Total | $ | 311,417 | | $ | 256,102 | | $ | 244,262

 
A significant portion of this business unit’s revenue is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and therefore the comparison from period to period reflects 

  the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Changes in exchange rates favorably affected the comparison of 2018 to 2017 by $6.5 million and by $2.8 million. 
 The feminine hygiene category accounted for 63% and 70% of Advanced Airlaid Material’s revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively, reflecting the Steinfurt acquisition, and growth in sales of wipes and table top products from additional capacity at the Fort Smith facility. Most feminine hygiene sales are to a small group of large, leading global consumer products companies. These markets are considered to be more growth oriented due to population growth in certain geographic regions and changing consumer preferences. In developing regions, demand is also influenced by increases in disposable income and cultural preferences. 
 AMBU operates state-of-the-art facilities in Falkenhagen and Steinfurt, Germany, Gatineau, Canada and Fort Smith, Arkansas. During 2018, this business unit’s capacity increased by a combined 52,000 metric tons from the Steinfurt acquisition and from the new Fort Smith facility.
 On October 1, 2018, we completed the Steinfurt acquisition for $181 million. The Steinfurt facility produces high-quality airlaid products for the table-top, wipes, hygiene, food pad, and other nonwoven materials markets, competing in the marketplace with nonwoven technologies and substrates, as well as other materials focused primarily on consumer based end-use applications.  The state-of-the art facility has 32,000-metric-ton-capacity and in 2017, net sales totaled $99 million.
 The business unit’s four facilities operate with the following combined attributes (in metric tons):
 
 
Airlaid Production Capacity | | Principal Raw Material (“PRM”) | | Estimated Annual Quantity of PRM | 
----------------------------+---------+--------------------------------+------------+----------------------------------+--------
 | 150,000 | | Fluff pulp | | 113,200

 
Key raw material inputs other than fluff pulp include synthetic fibers, super absorbent polymers and latex. The cost to produce is influenced by the cost of critical raw materials and by energy prices. Advanced Airlaid purchases substantially all the electricity and natural gas used in its operations. Approximately 72% of this business unit’s revenue is earned under contracts with pass-through provisions directly related to the cost of key raw materials.
 Advanced Airlaid continues to be a technology and product innovation leader in technically demanding segments of the airlaid market. This business unit’s airlaid material production employs multi-bonded and thermal-bonded airlaid technologies as opposed to other methods such as hydrogen-bonding. We believe that its facilities are among the most modern and flexible airlaid facilities in the

  world, allowing it to produce at industry leading operating rates. Its proprietary single-lane festooning technology provides converting and product packaging which supports efficiency optimization by the customers converting processes. This business unit’s in-house technical expertise combined with significant capital investment requirements and rigorous customer expectations creates large barriers to entry for new competitors.
