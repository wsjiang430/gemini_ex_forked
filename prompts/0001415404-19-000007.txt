ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
OVERVIEW 

EchoStar Corporation (which, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to as “EchoStar,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and/or “our”) is a holding company that was organized in October 2007 as a corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada and has operated as a separately traded public company from Dish Network Corporation (“DISH”) since 2008. A substantial majority of the voting power of the shares of each of EchoStar Corporation and DISH is owned beneficially by Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, and by certain entities established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family. Our Class A common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “SATS.”

We are a global provider of broadband satellite technologies, broadband internet services for home and small office customers, satellite operations and satellite services. We also deliver innovative network technologies, managed services and various communications solutions for aeronautical, enterprise and government customers.
Our industry continues to evolve with the increasing worldwide demand for broadband internet access for information, entertainment and commerce. In addition to fiber and wireless systems, other technologies such as geostationary high throughput satellites, low-earth orbit (“LEO”) networks, medium-earth orbit (“MEO”) systems, balloons and High Altitude Platform Systems are playing significant roles in enabling global broadband access, networks and services. We intend to use our expertise, technologies, capital, investments, global presence, relationships and other capabilities to continue to provide broadband internet systems, equipment, networks and services for information, the internet-of-things, entertainment and commerce in North America and internationally for consumers as well as aeronautical, enterprise and government customers. We are closely tracking the developments in next-generation satellite businesses, and we are seeking to utilize our services, technologies and expertise to find new commercial opportunities for our business. 
We currently operate in two business segments: Hughes and EchoStar Satellite Services (“ESS”), as discussed below. Our corporate department operations as well as activities that have not been assigned to our operating segments and eliminations of intersegment transactions are all accounted for in Corporate and Other in our segment reporting.
During 2017, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a share exchange agreement with DISH and certain of its subsidiaries. We, and certain of our subsidiaries, received all of the shares of the Hughes Retail Preferred Tracking Stock previously issued by us and one of our subsidiaries (together, the “Tracking Stock”) in exchange for 100% of the equity interests of certain of our subsidiaries that held substantially all of our former EchoStar Technologies businesses and certain other assets (collectively, the “Share Exchange”). Following the consummation of the Share Exchange, we no longer operate our former EchoStar Technologies businesses, the Tracking Stock was retired and is no longer outstanding, and all agreements, arrangements and policy statements with respect to the Tracking Stock terminated. As a result of the Share Exchange, the operating results of the EchoStar Technologies businesses have been presented as discontinued operations and as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”). See Note 4 for further discussion of our discontinued operations. 
BUSINESS STRATEGIES 

Capitalize on domestic and international demand for broadband services.  We intend to capitalize on the domestic and international demand for satellite-delivered broadband internet services and enterprise solutions by utilizing, among other things, our industry expertise, technology leadership, increased satellite capacity, access to spectrum resources, and high-quality, reliable service to drive growth in consumer subscribers and enterprise customers. We also intend to continue to selectively explore opportunities to pursue investments, commercial alliances, partnerships, joint ventures, acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic initiatives and transactions, domestically and internationally that we believe may allow us to increase our market share, increase our satellite capacity, expand into new markets, obtain new customers, broaden our portfolio of services, products and intellectual property, make our business more valuable, align us for future growth and expansion, maximize the return on our investments and strengthen our business and relationships with our customers. 

1

Expand satellite capacity and related infrastructure.  During 2018, we continued the design and construction of a new, next-generation, high throughput geostationary satellite, with a planned 2021 launch, that is primarily intended to provide additional capacity for our HughesNet satellite internet service (the “HughesNet service”) in North, Central and South America as well as aeronautical and enterprise services. We also continued to increase our satellite capacity in certain Central and South American countries and added capability for aeronautical, enterprise and international broadband internet services. We expect that our expertise in the identification, acquisition and development of satellite spectrum and orbital rights and satellite operations, together with our increased satellite capacity and existing, acquired or developed infrastructure, will provide opportunities to enter new international markets and enhance our services to our existing customers. We currently provide satellite broadband internet service in several Central and South American countries, and expect to continue to launch similar services in other Central and South American countries.  We believe market opportunities exist that will facilitate the acquisition or leasing of additional satellite capacity which will enable us to provide services to a broader customer base, including providers of pay-TV services, satellite-delivered broadband, corporate communications, and government services. 
Continue to selectively explore new domestic and international strategic initiatives. We intend to continue to selectively explore opportunities to pursue investments, commercial alliances, partnerships, joint ventures, acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic initiatives and transactions, domestically and internationally, that we believe may allow us to increase our existing market share, increase our satellite capacity, expand into new markets and new customers, broaden our portfolio of services, products and intellectual property, and strengthen our relationships with our customers. For example, our current agreement with WorldVu Satellites Limited (“OneWeb”), a global LEO satellite service company, enables us to provide certain equipment and services in connection with the ground network system for OneWeb’s LEO satellites. 
Continue development of S-band and other hybrid spectrum resources. Commercial service has been available to customers on our EchoStar XXI satellite since the fourth quarter of 2017, and we believe we remain in a unique position to deploy a European wide mobile satellite service (“MSS”)/complementary ground component (“CGC”) network and maximize the long-term value of our S-band spectrum in Europe and other regions within the scope of our licenses.  Additionally, we intend to seek additional licenses in the S-band spectrum and opportunities to align ourselves with other licensees for a coordinated development of the spectrum. We also intend to continue to explore development of S-band similar spectrum assets in additional international markets.

Develop improved and new technologies.  Our engineering capabilities provide us with the opportunity to develop and deploy cutting edge technologies, license our technologies to others, and maintain a leading technological position in the industries in which we are active.  
BUSINESS SEGMENTS

HUGHES SEGMENT 

Our Products and Services 

Our Hughes segment is a global provider of broadband satellite technologies and broadband internet services to home and small office customers and broadband network technologies, managed services, equipment, hardware, satellite services and communications solutions to consumers, aeronautical, enterprise and government customers. The Hughes segment also designs, provides and installs gateway and terminal equipment to customers for other satellite systems. In addition, our Hughes segment designs, develops, constructs and provides telecommunication networks comprising satellite ground segment systems and terminals to mobile system operators and our enterprise customers. 
We incorporate advances in technology to reduce costs and to increase the functionality and reliability of our products and services.  Through advanced and proprietary methodologies, technologies, software and techniques, we continue to improve the efficiency of our networks.  We invest in technologies to enhance our system and network management capabilities, specifically our managed services for enterprises.  We also continue to invest in next generation technologies that can be applied to our future products and services.  
We continue to focus our efforts on growing our consumer revenue by maximizing utilization of our existing satellites while planning for new satellites to be launched or acquired. Our consumer revenue growth depends on our success in adding new and retaining existing subscribers in our domestic and international markets across wholesale and retail channels. The growth of our enterprise businesses, including aeronautical, relies heavily on global economic conditions and the competitive landscape for pricing relative to competitors and alternative technologies. Service costs related 
2

to ongoing support for our direct and indirect customers and partners are typically impacted most significantly by our growth. 

Our Hughes segment currently uses capacity from three of our satellites (the SPACEWAY 3 satellite, the EchoStar XVII satellite and the EchoStar XIX satellite) and additional satellite capacity acquired from multiple third-party providers to provide services to our customers. In December 2016, we launched our EchoStar XIX satellite, a high throughput geostationary satellite employing a multi-spot beam, bent pipe Ka-band architecture, which provides capacity for the Hughes broadband services to our current and future customers in North America and certain Central and South American countries and our aeronautical and enterprise broadband services. Until new satellite launches or acquisitions provide additional capacity for subscriber growth, we manage subscriber growth across our existing satellite platform. 
In August 2017, we entered into a contract for the design and construction of the EchoStar XXIV, a new, next-generation, high throughput geostationary satellite, with a planned 2021 launch. The EchoStar XXIV satellite is primarily intended to provide additional capacity for our HughesNet service in North, Central and South America as well as aeronautical and enterprise broadband services. The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) granted authorization to construct, deploy and operate the EchoStar XXIV satellite. In the second half of 2018, Maxar Technologies Inc. (“Maxar”), the parent company of Space Systems/Loral (“SSL”), the manufacturer of our EchoStar XXIV satellite, announced that it was reviewing strategic alternatives for its geostationary communications satellite business to improve its financial performance and that it was in active discussions with potential buyers of the business. SSL has indicated to us that it intends to meet its contractual obligations regarding the timely manufacture and delivery of the EchoStar XXIV satellite. However, if SSL or any potential successor fails to meet or is delayed in meeting these obligations for any reason, including if Maxar decides to discontinue, wind down or otherwise significantly modify its geostationary communications satellite business, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, future revenues, financial position and prospects, completing the manufacture of the EchoStar XXIV satellite and our planned expansion of satellite broadband services throughout North, South and Central America. Capital expenditures associated with the construction and launch of this satellite are included in Corporate and Other in our segment reporting.
We continue our efforts to expand our consumer satellite services business outside of the U.S. We currently provide satellite broadband internet service in several Central and South American countries, and expect to continue to launch similar services in other Central and South American countries. In April 2014, we entered into a 15-year agreement with Eutelsat do Brasil for Ka-band capacity into Brazil on the EUTELSAT 65 West A satellite, which was launched in March 2016. We began delivering high-speed consumer satellite broadband services in Brazil in July 2016. Additionally, in September 2015, we entered into 15-year agreements pursuant to which affiliates of Telesat Canada (“Telesat”) provide us Ka-band capacity on a satellite located at the 63 degree west longitude orbital location. This satellite was launched in July 2018, placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2018 and augments the capacity being provided by the EUTELSAT 65 West A and EchoStar XIX satellites in Central and South America. 
In August 2018, we entered into an agreement with Al Yah Satellite Communications Company PrJSC (“Yahsat”) to establish a new entity, Broadband Connectivity Solutions (Restricted) Limited (together with its subsidiaries, “BCS”), to provide commercial Ka-band satellite broadband services across Africa, the Middle East and southwest Asia operating over Yahsat's Al Yah 2 and Al Yah 3 Ka-band satellites. The transaction was consummated in December 2018 when we invested $100 million in cash in exchange for a 20% interest in BCS. Under the terms of the agreement, we may also acquire, for further cash investments, additional ownership interests in BCS in the future provided certain conditions are met. We supply network operations and management services and equipment to BCS. 
Our Customers 

Our enterprise, government and aeronautical customers include, but are not limited to, lottery agencies, gas station operators, aircraft connectivity providers and companies with multi-branch networks that rely on satellite or terrestrial networks for critical communication across wide geographies. Most of our enterprise customers have contracts with us for the services they purchase. Our Hughes segment also designs, provides and installs gateway and terminal equipment to customers for other satellite systems and provides satellite ground segment systems and terminals for other satellite systems, including mobile system operators. Developments toward the launch of next-generation satellite systems, including LEO, MEO and geostationary systems, could provide additional opportunities to drive the demand for our equipment, hardware, technology and services.
3

As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had approximately 1,361,000, 1,208,000 and 1,036,000 broadband subscribers, respectively.  These broadband subscribers include customers that subscribe to our HughesNet services in North, Central and South America through retail, wholesale and small/medium enterprise service channels.  

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our Hughes segment had approximately $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of contracted revenue backlog.  We define Hughes contracted revenue backlog as our expected future revenue, including lease revenue, under customer contracts that are non-cancelable, excluding agreements with customers in our consumer market. Of the total contracted revenue backlog as of December 31, 2018, we expect to recognize approximately $430 million of revenue in 2019.

Our Competition 

Our industry is highly competitive.  As a global provider of network technologies, products and services, our Hughes segment competes with a large number of telecommunications service providers, which puts pressure on prices and margins.  To compete effectively, we emphasize our network quality, customization capability, offering of networks as a turnkey managed service, position as a single point of contact for products and services and competitive prices. 

In our consumer broadband satellite technologies and internet services markets, we compete against traditional telecommunications and wireless carriers, other satellite internet providers, as well as digital subscriber line (“DSL”), fiber and cable internet service providers offering competitive services in many markets we seek to serve.  Cost, speed and accessibility are key determining factors in the selection of a service provider by the consumer.  Our primary satellite competitor in our North American consumer market is ViaSat Communications, Inc., which is owned by ViaSat, Inc. (“ViaSat”).  We seek to differentiate ourselves based on the ubiquitous availability of our service, quality, proprietary technology, and distribution channels. 

In our aeronautical, enterprise and government markets, we compete against providers of satellite-based and terrestrial-based networks, including fiber, DSL, cable modem service, multiprotocol label switching and interest protocol-based virtual private networks. 
Our principal competitors for the supply of very-small-aperture terminal satellite networks are Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd, ViaSat, Newtec Cy N.V. and VT iDirect, Inc.  To differentiate ourselves from our competitors, we emphasize particular technological features of our products and services, our ability to customize networks and perform desired development work and the quality of our customer service. We also face competition from resellers and numerous local companies who purchase equipment and sell services to local customers, including domestic and international telecommunications operators, cable companies and other major carriers.
Manufacturing 

Certain products in our Hughes segment are assembled at our facilities in Maryland and we outsource a significant portion of the manufacturing of our products to third parties.  We believe that the manufacturing facilities used by our Hughes segment have sufficient capacity to handle current demand.  We adjust our capacity based on our production requirements.  We also work with third-party vendors for the development and manufacture of components that are integrated into our products.  We develop dual sourcing capabilities for critical parts when practical and we evaluate outsourced subcontract vendors on a periodic basis.  Our operations group, together with our engineering group, works with our vendors and subcontractors to reduce development costs, to increase production efficiency, and to obtain components at lower prices. 
ESS SEGMENT 

Our Services 

Our ESS segment is a global provider of satellite operations and satellite services. We operate our business using our owned and leased in-orbit satellites and related licenses. Revenue in our ESS segment depends largely on our ability to continuously make use of our available satellite capacity with existing customers and our ability to enter into commercial relationships with new customers. Our ESS segment, like others in the fixed satellite services (“FSS”) industry, has encountered, and may continue to encounter, negative pressure on transponder rates and demand.
4

We are also pursuing other opportunities such as providing value added services such as telemetry, tracking and control services to third parties, which leverage the ground monitoring networks and personnel currently within our ESS segment.
Our Customers 

We provide satellite operations and satellite services on a full-time and/or occasional-use basis primarily to DISH and its subsidiaries (“DISH Network”), Dish Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., a joint venture we entered into in 2008 (“Dish Mexico”), U.S. government service providers, internet service providers, broadcast news organizations, content providers and private enterprise customers. Our satellite capacity is currently used by our customers for a variety of applications, including:

• | DTH Services. We provide satellite operations and satellite services to broadcast news organizations, internet service providers and content providers who use our satellites to deliver programming and internet. Our satellites are also used for the transmission of live sporting events, internet access, disaster recovery, and satellite news gathering services. 


• | Government Services. We provide satellite and technical services to U.S. government service providers. 


• | Network Services. We provide satellite operations and satellite services to companies for private networks that allow delivery of video and data services for corporate communications. Our satellites can be used for point-to-point or point to multi-point communications. 

For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 DISH Network accounted for 86.5%, 87.9% and 85.7% of our total ESS segment revenue, and we expect that DISH Network will continue to be the primary source of revenue for our ESS segment as we have entered into certain commercial agreements with DISH Network pursuant to which we provide DISH Network with satellite services at fixed prices for varying lengths of time depending on the satellite.  Therefore, the results of operations of our ESS segment are linked to changes in DISH Network’s satellite capacity requirements, which historically have been driven by the addition of new channels and migration of programming to high-definition television and video on demand services. DISH Network’s future satellite capacity requirements may change for a variety of reasons, including its ability to construct and launch or acquire its own satellites, to continue to add new channels and/or to migrate to the provision of such channels and other video on demand services through streaming and other alternative technologies. There is no assurance that we will continue to provide satellite services to DISH Network beyond the terms of our agreements. Any termination or reduction in the satellite services we provide to DISH Network would cause us to have unused capacity on our satellites and require that we aggressively pursue alternative sources of revenue for this business. The agreement with DISH Network to lease satellite capacity on the EchoStar VII satellite expired in June 2018. As a result, we expect a $43 million annualized decrease in our revenue. We are exploring other opportunities to utilize this satellite in the future.  See Note 20 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of our related party transactions with DISH Network.
At each of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our ESS segment had contracted revenue backlog of approximately $832 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. We define contracted revenue backlog for our ESS segment as contracted future satellite lease revenue.  Of the total contracted revenue backlog as of December 31, 2018, we expect to recognize approximately $288 million of revenue in 2019.

Our Competition 

Our ESS segment competes against larger, well-established satellite service companies, such as Intelsat S.A., SES S.A., Telesat, and Eutelsat Communications S.A., in an industry that is characterized by long-term contracts and high costs for customers to change service providers.  Several of our competitors maintain key North American and other international orbital slots that may further limit competition and competitive pricing. 
OTHER BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES 
We intend to continue to selectively explore opportunities to pursue investments, commercial alliances, partnerships, joint ventures, acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic initiatives and transactions, domestically and internationally, that we believe may allow us to increase our existing market share, increase our satellite capacity, expand into new markets and new customers, broaden our portfolio of services, products and intellectual property, make our business 
5

more valuable, align us for future growth and expansion, maximize the return on our investments and strengthen our business and relationships with our customers. We may allocate or dispose of significant resources for long-term value that may not have a short or medium-term or any positive impact on our revenue, results of operations, or cash flow. 
In December 2013, we acquired an entity based in Dublin, Ireland, which we subsequently renamed EchoStar Mobile Limited (“EML”). EML is licensed by the European Union and its member states (“EU”) to provide MSS and CGC services covering the entire EU using S-band spectrum. Our EchoStar XXI satellite, which provides space segment capacity to EML in the EU, was launched in June 2017 and placed into service in November 2017. Commercial service has been available on our EchoStar XXI satellite since the fourth quarter of 2017. EML is focused on expanding its MSS operations in the EU through development of innovative mobile and machine-to-machine products and services. We believe we are in a unique position to deploy a European wide MSS and CGC network and maximize the long-term value of our S-band spectrum in Europe and other regions within the scope of our licenses.

Construction in progress as of December 31, 2018 included our EchoStar XXIV satellite, which is expected to launch in 2021. 
Recent Developments

EchoStar I and EchoStar VI. The EchoStar I and EchoStar VI satellites were removed from their orbital locations and retired from commercial service in January 2018 and May 2018, respectively. The retirement of these satellites has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. 
EchoStar 105/SES-11. The EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite was launched in October 2017 and was placed into service in November 2017 at the 105 degree west longitude orbital location. Pursuant to agreements that we entered into in August 2014, we funded substantially all construction, launch and other costs associated with the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite and transferred the C-, Ku- and Ka-band payloads to two affiliates of SES Americom, Inc. (“SES”) after the launch date, while retaining the right to use the entire Ku-band payload on the satellite for an initial ten-year term, with an option for us to renew the agreement on a year-to-year basis. In October 2017, we recorded a $77 million receivable from SES in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets,representing capitalized costs allocable to certain satellite payloads controlled by SES, and we reduced our carrying amount of the satellite by such amount. In January 2018, we received payment from SES for the receivable plus accrued interest. Our leased Ku-band payload on the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite has replaced the capacity we had on the AMC-15 satellite.
Telesat T19V. In September 2015, we entered into agreements pursuant to which affiliates of Telesat will provide to us Ka-band capacity on the Telesat T19V satellite at the 63 degree west longitude orbital location for a 15-year term. The Telesat T19V satellite was launched in July 2018 and placed into service in October 2018. This satellite augments the capacity being provided by the EUTELSAT 65 West A and EchoStar XIX satellites in Central and South America.
Satellite Anomalies and Impairments

Our satellites may experience anomalies from time to time, some of which may have a significant adverse effect on their remaining useful lives, the commercial operation of the satellites or our operating results or financial position. We are not aware of any anomalies with respect to our owned or leased satellites that have had any such significant adverse effect during the year ended December 31, 2018.  There can be no assurance, however, that anomalies will not have any such adverse effects in the future. In addition, there can be no assurance that we can recover critical transmission capacity in the event one or more of our satellites were to fail.

The EchoStar X satellite experienced anomalies in the past which affected seven solar array circuits. In December 2017, the satellite experienced anomalies which affected one additional solar array circuit reducing the number of functional solar array circuits to 16. As a result of these anomalies, we had a reduction in revenue of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.
We historically have not carried in-orbit insurance on our satellites because we have assessed that the cost of insurance is not economical relative to the risk of failures. Therefore, we generally bear the risk of any in-orbit failures. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements governing certain portions of our indebtedness, we are required, subject to certain limitations on coverage, to maintain in-orbit insurance for our SPACEWAY 3, EchoStar XVI and EchoStar XVII satellites. Our other satellites, either in orbit or under construction, are not covered by launch or in-orbit insurance. We will continue to assess circumstances going forward and make insurance decisions on a case-by-case basis. 
We evaluate our satellites for impairment and test for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Certain of the anomalies previously disclosed may be considered to represent a significant adverse change in the physical condition of a particular satellite. However, based on the redundancy designed within each satellite, certain of these anomalies are not necessarily considered to be significant events that would require a test of recoverability.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

We are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FCC for our domestic, as well as various international, satellite and telecommunications operations and equipment businesses.  We are also regulated by other U.S. federal agencies, state and local authorities, the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”), and certain foreign governments, including those in the EU and North, South and Central American countries.  In addition, we are also subject to the export control laws and regulations and trade sanctions laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries with respect to the export of telecommunications equipment and services.  Depending upon the circumstances, noncompliance with applicable legislation or regulations could result in suspension or revocation of our licenses or authorizations, the termination or loss of contracts or the imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal penalties.

The following summary of regulations and legislation is not intended to describe all present and proposed government regulation and legislation affecting our business.  Government regulations that are currently the subject of judicial or administrative proceedings, draft legislation or administrative proposals could impact us and our industries to varying degrees.  The FCC and other regulators from time to time initiate proceedings that could adversely impact our satellite operations, including spectrum usage.  We cannot predict either the outcome of these proceedings or proposals or any potential impact they might have on the industry or on our operations. 

FCC Regulations Applicable to Our Operations

FCC Jurisdiction over Satellite and Terrestrial Operations.  Non-governmental, including commercial entities, that use radio frequencies to provide communications services to, from or within the U.S. are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”).  The Communications Act gives the FCC regulatory jurisdiction over many areas relating to communications operations, including:

• | the assignment of satellite radio frequencies and orbital locations to specific services and companies, the licensing of satellites and earth stations, and the granting of related authorizations;


• | approval for the relocation of satellites to different orbital locations, the replacement of a satellite with another new or existing satellite, and the authorization of specific earth stations to communicate with such newly relocated satellites;


• | ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions of assignments, licenses, authorizations, and approvals;


• | avoiding harmful interference with other radio frequency emitters; and


• | ensuring compliance with other applicable provisions of the Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations.

All satellite licenses issued by the FCC are subject to expiration unless extended by the FCC.  The term of each of our U.S. direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) licenses is 10 years, and our U.S. FSS licenses generally have 15 year terms.  We hold licenses and authorizations for satellite and earth stations as well as other services, including terrestrial wireless services.  To obtain and operate under such FCC licenses and authorizations, we must satisfy legal, technical qualification requirements and other conditions including, among other things, satisfaction of certain technical and ongoing due diligence obligations, implementation bonds, annual regulatory fees and various reporting requirements. Licenses must be obtained prior to launching or operating a satellite.
Telecommunications Regulation.  Many of the services we provide are also subject to FCC regulation as telecommunications services.  For certain services in the U.S., we are required to contribute fees, computed as a percentage of our revenue from telecommunications services to the Universal Service Fund (“USF”) to support mechanisms that subsidize the provision of services to low-income consumers, high-cost areas, schools, libraries, and rural health care providers.  Current FCC rules permit us to pass this USF contribution through to our customers.  The FCC also requires broadband internet access and internet telephony service providers to comply with the requirements of the Federal Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which generally requires telecommunications carriers to ensure that law enforcement agencies are able to conduct lawfully-authorized surveillance of users of their services.  In addition, as a provider of interconnected voice over internet protocol services, we are required to abide by a number of rules related to telephony service, including rules dealing with the protection of customer information and the processing of emergency calls.

8

State and Local Regulation

We are also regulated by state and local authorities.  While the FCC has preempted many state and local regulations that would impair the installation and use of very-small-aperture terminals and other consumer satellite dishes, our businesses nonetheless are subject to state and local regulation, including, among others, obtaining regulatory authorizations and zoning regulations that affect the ability to install these consumer satellite earth station antennas.
International Regulation

Foreign Administrations’ Jurisdiction Over Satellite and Terrestrial Operations.  Some of our satellites and earth stations are licensed in foreign jurisdictions. We also have terrestrial authorizations in foreign jurisdictions.  In order to provide service to a foreign location from a U.S. satellite, we are required to obtain approvals from the FCC and foreign administrative agencies.  The laws and regulations addressing access to satellite and terrestrial systems vary from country to country.  In most countries, a license is required to provide our services and to operate satellite earth stations.  Such licenses may impose certain conditions, including implementation and operation of the satellite system in a manner consistent with certain milestones (such as for contracting, satellite design, construction, launch, and implementation of service), that the satellite or its launch be procured through a national entity, that the satellite control center be located in national territory, that a license be obtained prior to launching or operating the satellite, or that a license be obtained before interconnecting with the local switched telephone network and we may be subject to penalties or fines for failing to meet such conditions.  Additionally, some countries may have restrictions on the services we provide and how we provide them and/or may limit the rates that can be charged for the services we provide or impose other service terms or restrictions. Furthermore, foreign countries in which we currently, or may in the future, operate may not authorize us access to all of the spectrum that we need to provide service in a particular country. 

The ITU Frequency and Orbital Location Registration.  The orbital location and frequencies for our satellites are subject to the frequency registration and coordination process of the ITU.  The ITU Radio Regulations define the international rules, regulations, and rights for a satellite and associated earth stations to use specific radio frequencies at a specific orbital location.  These rules, which include deadlines for the bringing of satellite networks into use, differ depending on the type of service to be provided and the frequencies to be used by the satellite.  On our behalf, various countries have made, and may in the future make, additional filings for the frequency assignments at particular orbital locations that are used or to be used by our current satellite networks and potential future satellite networks we may build or acquire.  In the event the international coordination process that is triggered by ITU filings under applicable rules is not successfully completed, or that the requests for modification of the broadcast satellite services plan regarding the allocation of orbital locations and frequencies are not granted by the ITU, we will have to operate the applicable satellite(s) on a non-interference basis, which could have an adverse impact on our business operations.  If we cannot do so, we may have to cease operating such satellite(s) at the affected orbital locations.  We cannot be sure of the successful outcome of these ITU coordination processes.  We make commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the filing nation in the preparation of ITU filings, coordination of our operations in accordance with the relevant ITU Radio Regulations, and responses to relevant ITU inquiries.
Registration in the United Nations (“UN”) Registry of Space Objects.  The U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we license satellites are generally parties to the UN Convention on the Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space, which requires a satellite’s launching state to register the satellite as a space object.  The act of registration carries liability for the registering country in the event that the satellite causes third party damage.  Administrations may place certain requirements on satellite licensees in order to procure the necessary launch or operational authorizations that accompany registration of the satellite.  In some jurisdictions, these authorizations are separate and distinct, with unique requirements, from the authorization to use a set of frequencies to provide satellite services.

Telecommunications Regulation.  Many of the services we provide are also subject to the regulation of other countries as telecommunications services.  For certain services, we may be required to contribute fees to a universal service or other fund to support mechanisms that subsidize the provision of services to designated groups.  Many countries also impose requirements on telecommunications carriers to ensure that law enforcement agencies are able to conduct lawfully-authorized surveillance of users of their services.  In addition, we are subject to a number of other rules, including rules related to telephony service such as the protection of customer information and processing of emergency calls.

Export Control Regulation

In the operation of our business, we must comply with all applicable export control and trade sanctions laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries.  Applicable U.S. laws and regulations include the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”).

The export of certain hardware, technical data, and services relating to satellites and the supply of certain ground control equipment, technical data and services to non-U.S. persons or to destinations outside the U.S. is regulated by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) under the EAR.  In addition, BIS regulates our export of satellite communications network equipment to non-U.S. persons or to destinations outside of the U.S.  The export of other items is regulated by the U.S. Department of State’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (“DDTC”) under the ITAR and are subject to strict export control and prior approval requirements.  In addition, we cannot provide certain equipment or services to certain countries subject to U.S. trade sanctions unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations from OFAC.  We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or giving or promising to give anything of value to foreign government officials and other individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining a competitive advantage.

Environmental Regulation

We are subject to the requirements of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations.  These include laws regulating air emissions, waste-water discharge and waste management, most significantly the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (“EPCRA”).  Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, our Hughes segment is considered a small quantity generator.

As required by the EPCRA, we file annual reports with regulatory agencies covering four areas: Emergency Planning, Emergency Release, Hazardous Chemical Storage, and Toxic Chemical Release Inventory.  We maintain small quantities of hazardous materials on our premises and, therefore, have relatively modest reporting requirements under the EPCRA.  We are also subject to the requirements of other environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations.  Additionally, we review the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act Title III regulatory requirements and annually report quantities of onsite material storage using Tier II, state DEQ (Department of Environmental Quality) reporting systems.

Our environmental compliance costs, capital and other expenditures to date have not been material, and we do not expect them to be material in 2019.  However, environmental requirements are complex, change frequently, and have become more stringent over time.  Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that these requirements will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or environmental compliance costs, capital or other expenditures.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We currently rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark law, together with licenses, non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements and technical measures, to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products.  We hold U.S. and foreign patents covering various aspects of our products and services.  The duration of each of our U.S. patents is generally 20 years from the earliest filing date to which the patent has priority.  We have granted licenses to use our trademarks and service-marks to affiliates and resellers worldwide, and we typically retain the right to monitor the use of those marks and impose significant restrictions on their use in efforts to ensure a consistent brand identity.  We protect our proprietary rights in our software through software licenses that, among other things, require that the software source code be maintained as confidential information and that prohibit any reverse-engineering of that code.

We believe that our patents are important to our business.  We also believe that, in some areas, the improvement of existing products and the development of new products, as well as reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how, are important in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage.  We believe, to a certain extent, that the value of our products and services are dependent upon our proprietary software, hardware, and other technology remaining trade secrets and/or subject to copyright protection.  Generally, we enter into non-disclosure 
10

and invention assignment agreements with our employees, subcontractors, and certain customers and other business partners.  Please see Item 3. — Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K for more information.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING 

We have a skilled and multi-disciplined engineering organization that develops our products and services.  Our in-house technological capability includes a wide range of skills required to develop systems, hardware, software, and firmware used in our products and services.  

With respect to hardware development, we have skill sets that include complex digital designs, radio frequency and intermediate frequency analog designs, advanced application-specific integrated circuit designs, and sophisticated consumer and system level packaging designs.  We also have extensive experience in developing products for high-volume, low-cost manufacturing for the consumer industry, including dual mode satellite and wireless handsets. 

As a complement to our hardware development, we have extensive experience in designing reliable, real time, embedded software systems as part of our communication systems and services offerings.  For example, our broadband product line for the enterprise market supports an extensive range of protocols for data communications.  Our engineers have also developed many large turnkey systems for our customers by designing the overall solution, implementing the various subsystems, deploying the entire network and user terminals, integrating and verifying the operational system, and ultimately training the customers’ technicians and operators.

Costs incurred in research and development activities are generally expensed as incurred. A significant portion of our research and development costs are incurred in connection with the specific requirements of a customer’s order. In such instances, the amounts for these customer funded development efforts are included in Cost of sales - equipment.
