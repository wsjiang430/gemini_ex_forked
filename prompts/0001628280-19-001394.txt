Item 1. Business 
Polaris Industries Inc., a Minnesota corporation, was formed in 1994 and is the successor to Polaris Industries Partners LP. The terms “Polaris,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” as used herein refer to the business and operations of Polaris Industries Inc., its subsidiaries and its predecessors, which began doing business in 1954. We design, engineer and manufacture powersports vehicles which include, Off-Road Vehicles (ORV), including All-Terrain Vehicles (ATV) and side-by-side vehicles for recreational and utility use, Snowmobiles, Motorcycles, Global Adjacent Markets vehicles, including Commercial, Government and Defense vehicles, and Boats. Polaris products, together with related Parts, Garments and Accessories (PG&A), as well as aftermarket accessories and apparel, are sold through dealers, distributors and retail stores principally located in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia and Mexico. 
Industry 
Off-Road Vehicles. ORVs are four-wheel vehicles designed for off-road use and traversing rough terrain, dunes, swamps and marshland. The vehicles can be multi-passenger or single passenger, are used for recreation in such sports as fishing and hunting and for trail and dune riding, and for utility purposes on farms, ranches, and construction sites. The off-road vehicle industry is comprised of ATVs and side-by-side vehicles. The North American ATV industry decreased mid single-digits percent in 2018 with approximately 260,000 ATVs sold. Internationally, ATVs are also sold primarily in Western European countries by similar manufacturers as in North America. We estimate that during 2018 world-wide industry sales were down low single-digits percent from 2017 levels with approximately 370,000 ATVs sold worldwide. We estimate that worldwide side-by-side vehicle market sales increased mid single-digits percent during 2018 over 2017 levels with just over a half million side-by-side vehicles sold. The side-by-side market has increased consistently over the past several years primarily due to continued innovation by manufacturers. We estimate that total worldwide off-road vehicle industry sales for 2018, which include core ATVs and side-by-side vehicles, were up low singe-digits percent from 2017 levels with approximately 900,000 units sold. 
Snowmobiles. Snowmobiles have been manufactured under the Polaris name since 1954. We estimate that during the season ended March 31, 2018, world-wide industry sales of snowmobiles increased mid-single digits percent from the previous season levels with approximately 125,000 units sold worldwide. 
Motorcycles. Motorcycles are utilized as a mode of transportation as well as for recreational purposes. The industry is comprised of four segments: cruisers, touring, sport bikes and standard motorcycles. We entered the motorcycle market in 1998. We estimate that the combined 900cc and above cruiser and touring market segments (including the moto-roadster Slingshot®) decreased low double-digits percent in 2018 compared to 2017 levels with an estimated 190,000 heavyweight cruiser, touring, and mid-size motorcycles sold in the North American market. We estimate that during 2018, worldwide combined 900cc and above cruiser and touring market segments (including Slingshot) sales decreased mid single-digits percent from 2017 levels, with an estimated 300,000 units sold worldwide. 
Global Adjacent Markets. These vehicles are designed to support people mobility as well as various commercial work applications, and include products in the light-duty hauling, people mover, industrial and urban/suburban commuting sub-sectors, as well as tactical defense vehicles. We estimate the worldwide target market for Polaris’ Adjacent Markets vehicles was over $6.0 billion in 2018, which includes light duty hauling, people movers, industrial, rental, urban/suburban commuting and related quadricycles. 
Aftermarket. Aftermarket parts, garments and accessories are sold through a highly fragmented industry, which includes dealers, aftermarket e-commerce, big box retailers, distributors and specialty 4x4 retailers. We estimate the target market for Jeep and truck aftermarket accessories was approximately $10.0 billion in 2018, and the target market for Powersports aftermarket parts, garments and accessories to be approximately $2.0 billion in 2018. 
Boats. Our boats are designed to compete in key segments of the recreational marine industry, including pontoon, deck, bowrider, cruiser and fishing boats. Inclusive of the segments in which we compete, we estimate total worldwide 2018 powerboats market sales were approximately $8.0 billion, with pontoon and fishing boats being two of the largest and fastest growing segments therein.

In 2018, Polaris Boats, including the Bennington and Godfrey brands, was the market share leader in pontoon boats and our Hurricane brand was the market share leader in deck boats.
Significant Acquisitions
Boats. On July 2, 2018, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 29, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Boat Holdings, LLC, a privately held Delaware limited liability company, headquartered in Elkhart, Indiana which manufactures boats (“Boat Holdings”).
The transaction was structured as an acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity interests in Boat Holdings for aggregate consideration of $806.7 million, net of cash acquired, subject to customary adjustments based on, among other things, the amount of cash, debt and working capital in the business of Boat Holdings at the closing date. A portion of the aggregate consideration equal to $100.0 million will be paid in the form of a series of deferred annual payments over 12 years following the closing date.
We funded the purchase price for the acquisition by amending, extending, and up-sizing our credit facility and with the proceeds of the issuance of 4.23% Senior Notes, Series 2018, due July 3, 2028.
Transamerican Auto Parts. On October 11, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with TAP Automotive Holdings, LLC (“Transamerican Auto Parts” or “TAP”), to acquire the outstanding equity interests in Transamerican Auto Parts, a privately held, vertically integrated manufacturer, distributor, retailer and installer of off-road Jeep® and truck accessories, for an aggregate consideration of $668.3 million, net of cash acquired. The transaction closed on November 10, 2016. We funded the purchase price with borrowings under our existing credit facilities.
Manufacturing and Distribution Operations 
Our products are primarily assembled at our 19 global manufacturing facilities. We are vertically integrated in several key components of our manufacturing process, including plastic injection molding, welding, clutch assembly and painting. Fuel tanks, tracks, tires, seats and instruments, and certain other component parts are purchased from third-party vendors. Raw materials or standard parts are readily available from multiple sources for the components manufactured by us. Polaris Boats has a long-term supply contract with an engine manufacturer, which requires a certain share of total engine purchases, and include favorable pricing, as well as various growth and volume incentives.  
We do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining substitute supply arrangements for other raw materials or components that we generally obtain from limited sources (however our costs could increase if we are required to switch suppliers). 
Contract carriers ship our products from our manufacturing and distribution facilities to our customers. We maintain several leased wholegoods distribution centers where final set-up and up-fitting is completed for certain models before shipment to customers. 
Our corporate headquarters facility is in Medina, Minnesota, and we maintain 30 other sales and administrative facilities across the world. Our products are distributed to our dealers, distributors and customers through a network of 33 distribution centers, including third-party providers.

Production Scheduling 
We produce and deliver our products throughout the year based on dealer, distributor and customer orders. Side-by-side orders are placed in approximately two-week intervals for the high volume dealers driven by retail sales trends at the individual dealership. Smaller dealers utilize a similar process, but on a less frequent ordering cycle. Side-by-side retail sales activity at the dealer level drives orders which are incorporated into each product’s production scheduling. International distributor ORV orders are taken throughout the year. Orders for each year’s production of snowmobiles are placed by the dealers and distributors in the spring. 
We utilize our Retail Flow Management (RFM) ordering system for motorcycle, side-by-side and ATV dealers. The RFM system allows dealers to order daily, create a segment stocking order, and eventually reduce order fulfillment times to what we expect will be less than three weeks. 
For snowmobiles, we offer a pre-order SnowCheck program in the spring for our customers that assists us in production planning. This program allows our customers to order a true factory-customized snowmobile by selecting various options, including chassis, track, suspension, colors and accessories. Manufacture of snowmobiles commences in late winter of the previous season and continues through late autumn or early winter of the current season. We manufacture ORVs, motorcycles and people mobility vehicles year round. 
For boats, through the use of offseason incentive programs, we adhere to level production throughout the year, minimizing disruption to the workforce and vendor network.  
Sales and Marketing 
Our products are sold through a network of approximately 2,250 independent dealers in North America, and approximately 1,400 independent international dealers through 31 subsidiaries and approximately 85 independent distributors in over 120 countries outside of North America. A majority of our dealers and distributors are multi-line and also carry competitor products, however few carry our full line of products and, while relatively consistent, the actual number of dealers can vary from time to time.
ORV/Snowmobiles. We sell our ORVs directly to a network of over 1,450 dealers. Many of our ORV dealers and distributors are also authorized snowmobile dealers, and are located in the snowbelt regions of the United States and Canada. We sell our snowmobiles to a network of approximately 650 dealers. 
Motorcycles. Indian motorcycles and Slingshot are distributed directly through independently owned dealers and distributors, except in Australia where we have four Company-owned retail stores. Indian motorcycles are sold through a network of approximately 200 North American dealers, and Slingshot currently has approximately 400 North American dealers. 
Global Adjacent Markets. Within Global Adjacent Markets, our vehicles each have their own distribution networks through which their respective vehicles are distributed. GEM has approximately 200 dealers. Goupil and Aixam sell directly to customers in France, through subsidiaries in certain Western European countries and through several dealers and distributors for markets outside such countries. Taylor-Dunn has approximately 200 United States dealers and approximately 50 international dealers. 
In addition, we sell Polaris vehicles directly to military and government agencies and other national accounts and supply a highly differentiated side-by-side vehicle to Bobcat Company. We have a partnership with Ariens Company (“Ariens”), a manufacturer of outdoor power equipment. Through the partnership, we leverage each other’s dealer networks, share certain technologies and research and development, and supply Ariens with a highly differentiated work vehicle to sell through its dealer network.
Aftermarket. TAP sells through its retail stores, call center and e-commerce sites, while also supporting numerous independent accessory retailers/installers through their wholesale distribution network. TAP conducts business through a three-pronged sales, service, and manufacturing paradigm. TAP has 93 brick-and-mortar 4 Wheel Parts retail centers, staffed with experienced product and installation specialists. TAP’s omni-channel retail strategy includes a significant e-commerce business with 4WheelParts.com and 4WD.com. The TAP e-commerce network facilitates consumer sales, service and support, including “pick-up-in-store.” 
Kolpin Outdoors, Pro Armor and Trail Tech are marketed through Apex Product Group, a unified sales and customer service company, which makes it easier and more efficient for dealers to purchase those brands. Klim and 509 each have their own dealer/distributor networks. 
6

Boats. In a highly fragmented industry, our extensive, experienced and loyal network of over 500 active dealers is a competitive advantage, helping to generate steady demand. Concentrated primarily in North America, this dealer network is organized into distinct sales territories supported by experienced sales reps and leadership. 
Dealer agreements. Dealers and distributors sell our products under contractual arrangements pursuant to which the dealer or distributor is authorized to market specified products and is required to carry certain replacement parts and perform certain warranty and other services. Changes in dealers and distributors take place from time to time. We believe a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors exist in all geographic areas.
Floor plan financing. Polaris Acceptance provides floor plan financing to our dealers in the United States under our current partnership agreement with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo acquired the business in 2016. We have a 50 percent equity interest in Polaris Acceptance, and do not guarantee the outstanding indebtedness of Polaris Acceptance. As part of the agreement, Polaris sells portions of its receivable portfolio to a securitization facility (“Securitization Facility”), from time to time on an ongoing basis. The partnership agreement is effective through February 2022. See Notes 6 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of this financial services arrangement. 
We have arrangements with Polaris Acceptance (United States), Wells Fargo affiliates (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, China and New Zealand), and TCF Financial Corporation (“TCF”) to provide floor plan financing for our dealers. A majority of our North American sales of snowmobiles, ORVs, motorcycles, boats, and related PG&A are financed under arrangements whereby we are paid within a few days of shipment of our product. We participate in the cost of dealer financing and have agreed to repurchase products from the finance companies under certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations. We have not historically been required to repurchase a significant number of units; however, there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these financial services arrangements. 
Customer financing. We do not offer consumer financing directly to the end users of our products. Instead, we have agreements in place with various third party financing companies, to provide financing services to those end consumers.
A wholly-owned subsidiary of Polaris has a multi-year agreement with Sheffield Financial (“Sheffield”) pursuant to which Sheffield agreed to make available closed-end installment consumer and commercial credit to customers of our dealers for Polaris products. The current installment credit agreement under which Sheffield provides installment credit lending for ORVs, snowmobiles and certain other Polaris products expires in December 2020.
A wholly-owned subsidiary of Polaris entered into a multi-year agreement with Evergreen Bank Group in September 2016. The agreement established Performance Finance as a division of Evergreen Bank Group, and is exclusively focused on the financing of Polaris motorcycles. The current installment credit agreement under which Performance Finance provides installment credit lending for motorcycles expires in December 2021.
A wholly-owned subsidiary of Polaris has a multi-year contract with Synchrony Bank, under which Synchrony Bank makes available closed-end installment consumer and commercial credit to customers of our dealers for both Polaris and non-Polaris products. The current installment credit agreement under which Synchrony Bank provides installment credit lending for Polaris products expires in December 2020.
Marketing. Our marketing activities are designed primarily to promote and communicate directly with consumers to assist the selling and marketing efforts of our dealers and distributors. We make available and advertise discount or rebate programs, retail financing or other incentives for our dealers and distributors to remain price competitive in order to accelerate retail sales to consumers. We advertise our products directly to consumers using print advertising in the industry press and in user group publications and on the internet, social media, billboards, television and radio. We also provide media advertising and partially underwrite dealer and distributor media advertising to a degree and on terms which vary by product and from year to year. We produce promotional films for our products, which are available to dealers for use in the showroom or at special promotions. We also provide product brochures, posters, dealer signs and miscellaneous other promotional items for use by dealers. 
We spent $491.8 million, $471.8 million and $342.2 million for sales and marketing activities in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Engineering, Research and Development, and New Product Introduction 
We have approximately 1,100 employees who are engaged in the development and testing of existing products and research and development of new products and improved production techniques, located primarily in our Roseau and Wyoming, Minnesota facilities and in Burgdorf, Switzerland. 
7

We utilize internal combustion engine testing facilities to design engine configurations for our products. We utilize specialized facilities for matching engine, exhaust system and clutch performance parameters in our products to achieve desired fuel consumption, power output, noise level and other objectives. Our engineering department is equipped to make small quantities of new product prototypes for testing and for the planning of manufacturing procedures. In addition, we maintain numerous facilities where each of the products is extensively tested under actual use conditions. We utilize our Wyoming, Minnesota facility for engineering, design and development personnel for our line of engines and powertrains, ORVs, motorcycles, and certain Global Adjacent Market vehicles, and our Roseau, Minnesota facility for our snowmobile and certain ATV research and development. We utilize our Elkhart, Indiana facility for engineering, design and development for our boats research and development. We also own Swissauto Powersports Ltd., an engineering company that develops high performance and high efficiency engines and innovative vehicles. 
Intellectual Property 
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology. We have filed and obtained numerous patents in the United States and abroad, and regularly file patent applications worldwide in our continuing effort to establish and protect our proprietary technology. Additionally, we have numerous registered trademarks, trade names and logos in the United States, Canada and other international countries. 
Competition 
The off-road vehicle, snowmobile, motorcycle, boat, people mobility and work utility solutions, and aftermarket industries in the United States, Canada and other global markets are highly competitive. As a powersports original equipment manufacturer (OEM), our competition primarily comes from North American and Asian manufacturers. As a boat OEM, our competition primarily comes from North American and European manufacturers. For our aftermarket business, our competition is highly fragmented across the retail and online channels. Competition in such markets is based upon a number of factors, including price, quality, reliability, styling, product features and warranties. At the dealer level, competition is based on a number of factors, including sales and marketing support programs (such as financing and cooperative advertising). Certain of our competitors are more diversified, benefit from different laws and regulatory schemes outside the US, and have financial and marketing resources that are substantially greater than those of Polaris. 
 We believe that our products are competitively priced and our sales and marketing support programs for dealers are comparable to those provided by our competitors. Our products compete with many other recreational products for the discretionary spending of consumers, and to a lesser extent, with other vehicles designed for utility applications. 
Product Safety & Regulatory Affairs
Product safety regulations. Federal, state and local governments around the world have promulgated and/or are considering promulgating laws and regulations relating to the safety of our products. For example, in the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to snowmobiles, snow-bikes and off-road vehicles. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to motorcycles (including Slingshot) and on-road people mobility vehicles (including GEM). The U.S. Coast Guard (part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security) is the federal agency responsible for maritime safety, security and environmental stewardship in U.S. ports and waterways. 
In August 2008, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (“Act”) was passed which, among other things, required ATV manufacturers and distributors to comply with previously voluntary American National Standards Institute (ANSI) safety standards developed by the Specialty Vehicle Institute of America (SVIA). The Act also requires CPSC to update the mandatory standard (if it deems doing so to be appropriate) based on updates to the voluntary ANSI/SVIA standards, which has occurred.  The Act also includes a provision that requires the CPSC to complete an ATV rulemaking process it started in August 2006 regarding the need for safety standards or increased safety standards for ATVs. This process has not yet resulted in the issuance of a final rule.  We believe that our products comply with all applicable CPSC, ANSI and/or SVIA safety standards, as well as all other applicable safety standards in the U.S. or internationally. In addition, we have had an action plan on file with the CPSC since 1998 regarding safety related issues.
In October 2009, the CPSC published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding ROV safety under the Consumer Product Safety Act. In December 2014, the CPSC published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that includes proposed mandatory safety standards for ROVs in the areas of lateral stability, steering and handling, and occupant retention. Polaris, by itself and through ROHVA, has expressed concerns about the proposed mandatory standards, 
8

whether they would actually reduce ROV incident rates, whether the proposed tests are repeatable and appropriate for ROVs, and the unintended safety consequences that could result from them. As a result of those concerns, revisions to the voluntary ANSI/ROHVA standard were proposed. In 2015, CPSC staff expressed support for the proposed 2016 revisions to the ANSI standard, and subsequently recommended that the CPSC terminate its rule-making process. We are unable to predict the outcome of the CPSC rule-making process or the ultimate impact of any resulting rules on our business and operating results.
We are a member of the Recreational Off-Highway Vehicle Association (ROHVA), which was established to promote the safe and responsible use of side-by-side vehicles also known as Recreational Off-Highway Vehicles (ROVs), a category that includes our RANGER, Polaris GENERAL, RZR, and Polaris ACE vehicles. Since early 2008, ROHVA has been engaged in a comprehensive process for developing through ANSI and updating voluntary standards for equipment, configuration and performance requirements of ROVs. Comments on the draft standards have been actively solicited from the CPSC and other stakeholders as part of the ANSI process. The standard, which addresses stability, occupant retention and other safety performance criteria, was approved and published by ANSI in March 2010, and then revised in 2011, 2014 and 2016.  We believe that our products comply with all applicable ROHVA/ANSI safety standards, as well as all other applicable safety standards in the U.S. or internationally.
We are a member of the International Snowmobile Manufacturers Association (ISMA), a trade association formed among other reasons to promote safety in the manufacture and use of snowmobiles. ISMA members include all of the major snowmobile manufacturers. The ISMA members are also members of the Snowmobile Safety and Certification Committee, which promulgated voluntary sound and safety standards for snowmobiles that have been adopted as regulations in some states of the United States and in Canada. These standards require testing and evaluation by an independent testing laboratory. We believe that our snow products comply with all applicable U.S. and international safety standards.
Motorcycles and certain people mobility vehicles are subject to certain U.S. and foreign vehicle safety and equipment standards, including those standards administered by the NHTSA.  Our products and their operators are also subject to various international state and local vehicle equipment and safety standards. Our products are occasionally classified differently in various international jurisdictions.  For example, our Slingshot vehicle is classified as a motorcycle under U.S. federal law, but may be classified differently in other jurisdictions. We believe our motorcycles (including Slingshot), people mobility vehicles, and all other of our on-road products comply with all applicable U.S and international safety and equipment standards pursuant to each product’s classification.
Our maritime products are subject to marine safety regulations for vessels developed and enforced by the U.S. Coast Guard and its foreign equivalents.  We believe that our marine products comply with all applicable U.S. and international safety, design, construction and equipment standards.  We are committed to improving recreational boating safety, we maintain strong leadership roles in many international maritime organizations, and we have supported and continue to support a variety of government and nongovernment boating safety efforts in partnership with government agencies and marine industry associations.
Product use regulations. Federal, state and local laws and regulations around the world have been promulgated, and at various times, ordinances or legislation is introduced, relating to the use or manner of use of our products. Some government entities have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws that restrict the use of ORVs and snowmobiles to specified hours and locations. For example, the U.S. federal government also has legislative and executive authority to restrict the use of ORVs, snowmobiles and other products in national parks and on federal lands. In several instances, this restriction has been a ban on the recreational use of these products in these areas.
Environmental regulations. Federal, state and local governments around the world have adopted and/or are considering adopting laws relating to the reduction or elimination of certain substances and materials in consumer products and the reduction of vehicle greenhouse gas emissions.  These regulations are an important component of global environmental and climate protection, and therefore form a key regulatory framework in the design of our products.
For example, in the United States, the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) have both adopted regulations in these areas which are applicable to certain of our products.  Canada’s emission regulations for motorcycles, ORVs and snowmobiles are similar to those in the United States. The Europe Union currently regulates emissions from our motorcycles and certain of our ATV-based products for which we obtain whole vehicle type approvals. In 2014, the EU finalized the details of new regulations that made these European emission requirements more stringent beginning in 2016.  We executed the first motorcycle and ATV-based product certifications under these strict EU emissions standards in 2016. Emissions from certain other Polaris ORV and 
9

snowmobile engines in vehicles sold in the EU subsequently may be covered by the non-road mobile machinery directive currently being finalized there.  We are developing compliance solutions for these future EU emissions regulations.  We are also currently developing and obtaining engine and emission technologies to meet the requirements of future anticipated international emission standards.
We believe that our products comply with all applicable U.S. and international environmental standards and related regulations, including but not limited to all applicable emissions and product substance and materials laws.  We are unable to predict the ultimate impact of any proposed new environmental regulations on our business.  Risks may also emerge in connection with the adherence to these environmental regulatory requirements - particularly in the case of regulatory vagueness that may be interpreted differently by Polaris and the agencies responsible for the respective regulations.
Employees 
Due to the seasonality of our business and certain changes in production cycles, total employment levels vary throughout the year. Despite such variations in employment levels, employee turnover has not been high. During 2018, on a worldwide basis, we employed an average of approximately 12,000 full-time persons, a nine percent increase from 2017, driven by the acquisition of Boat Holdings. Approximately 4,700 of our employees are salaried. We consider our relations with our employees to be excellent.

Forward-Looking Statements 
This 2018 Annual Report contains not only historical information, but also “forward-looking statements” intended to qualify for the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These “forward-looking statements” can generally be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as we or our management “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “estimates” or words of similar import. Similarly, statements that describe our future plans, objectives or goals, such as future sales, shipments, net income, and net income per share, operational initiatives, tariffs, currency fluctuations, interest rates, and commodity costs, are forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements, are also forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may also be made from time to time in oral presentations, including telephone conferences and/or webcasts open to the public. 
Potential risks and uncertainties include such factors as the Company’s ability to successfully implement its manufacturing operations expansion initiatives, product offerings, promotional activities and pricing strategies by competitors; economic conditions that impact consumer spending; acquisition integration costs; product recalls, warranty expenses; impact of changes in Polaris stock price on incentive compensation plan costs; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; environmental and product safety regulatory activity; effects of weather; commodity costs; freight and tariff costs; changes to international trade agreements; uninsured product liability claims; uncertainty in the retail and wholesale credit markets; performance of affiliate partners; changes in tax policy; relationships with dealers and suppliers; and the general overall economic and political environment. The risks and uncertainties discussed in this report are not exclusive and other factors that we may consider immaterial or do not anticipate may emerge as significant risks and uncertainties. 
Any forward-looking statements made in this report or otherwise speak only as of the date of such statement, and we undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting such forward-looking statements. We advise you, however, to consult any further disclosures made on related subjects in future quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K that are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
