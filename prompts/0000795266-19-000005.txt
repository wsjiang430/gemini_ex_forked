Item 1. | BUSINESS

General
KB Home is one of the largest and most recognized homebuilding companies in the U.S. We have been building homes for over 60 years, with more than 600,000 homes delivered since our founding in 1957. We build a variety of new homes designed primarily for first-time and first move-up, as well as second move-up and active adult homebuyers, including attached and detached single-family residential homes, townhomes and condominiums. We offer homes in development communities, at urban in-fill locations and as part of mixed-use projects. Our homebuilding operations represent the majority of our business, accounting for 99.7% of our total revenues in 2018. Our financial services operations, which accounted for the remaining .3% of our total revenues in 2018, offer various insurance products to our homebuyers in the markets where we build homes and provide title services in certain of those markets. Our financial services operations also provide mortgage banking services, including residential consumer mortgage loan (“mortgage loan”) originations, to our homebuyers indirectly through KBHS Home Loans, LLC (“KBHS”), an unconsolidated joint venture we formed with Stearns Lending, LLC (“Stearns”). 
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “we,” “our” and “us” used in this report refer to KB Home, a Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries. Also, as used in this report, “home” is a single-family residence, whether it is a single-family home or other type of residential property; “community” is a single development in which new homes are constructed as part of an integrated plan; and “community count” is the number of communities we have open for sales with at least five homes/lots left to sell.
The following charts present homes delivered, homebuilding revenues, homebuilding operating income and pretax income for the years ended November 30, 2016, 2017 and 2018:

Additional financial and operational information related to our homebuilding reporting segments, including revenues, operating income (loss), pretax income (loss), inventories and assets, is provided below in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 2 – Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. 
Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. The above table does not include homes delivered or revenues from unconsolidated joint ventures in which we participate. These unconsolidated joint ventures acquire and develop land in various markets where our homebuilding operations are located and, in some cases, build and deliver homes on the land developed.
Business Strategy
Since 2016, we have implemented a Returns-Focused Growth Plan that is designed to generate higher revenues and improvement in our homebuilding operating income margin, return on invested capital, return on equity and leverage ratio, and to achieve certain financial targets for these metrics in 2019. The plan’s main components are (1) executing our core business strategy, (2) improving our asset efficiency and (3) monetizing our significant deferred tax assets. 
Executing Our Core Business Strategy. Our core business strategy, which we call KB2020, is to expand our scale primarily within our current geographic footprint to achieve a top-five position in each of our served markets (based on homes delivered). KB2020 is a systematic, fact-based and process-driven approach to homebuilding that is grounded in gaining a detailed understanding of consumers’ location and product preferences and product price-to-value perceptions. As used in this report and elsewhere, the term “product” encompasses a home’s floor plan design and interior/exterior style, amenities, functions and features. 
3

KB2020 consists of the following key principles with respect to customers, land, products and operations: 

• | Customers. With our customer-first, Built-to-Order™ homebuying process, we provide each of our homebuyers with a highly personalized experience where they can make a wide range of structural and design choices for their future new home. Our community teams of sales representatives, design consultants and other personnel partner closely with each homebuyer through each major step in the design, construction and closing of their KB home. We believe this highly interactive process that enables our homebuyers to design a home with the particular features and amenities they want based on how they live and what they value, at an affordable price, enhances customer satisfaction and gives us a meaningful competitive advantage over other homebuilders and resale homes. 


• | Land. We seek to manage our working capital and reduce our operating risks by primarily acquiring entitled land parcels at reasonable prices within attractive submarkets as identified by our market research activities. We typically focus on metropolitan areas with favorable long-term economic and population growth prospects that we believe have the potential to sustain a minimum of 800 homes delivered per year, and target land parcels that meet our investment return standards. Identified consumer preferences and home sales activity largely direct where our land acquisition teams search for available land. In 2018, we refined our approach to land acquisition to focus on investments that provide a one- to two-year supply of land or lots per community, and individual assets that are generally between 50 to 200 lots in size. Our primary focus continues to be our existing geographic footprint, encompassing markets we identified for their long-term economic and demographic growth potential. We leverage the relationships we have with land owners, developers and brokers to find and acquire land parcels, and use our experience in working with municipalities to efficiently obtain development approvals. 


• | Products. We offer our customers a base product with a standardized set of functions and features that is generally priced to be affordable for the local area’s median household income level. As noted above, our Built-to-Order approach provides customers the opportunity to select their lot location within a community, floor plan, elevation and structural options, and to personalize their homes with numerous interior design options and upgrades in our design studios. Our design studios, generally centrally located within our served markets, are a key component of our Built-to-Order process, and the mix of design options and upgrades they offer are primarily based on the preferences identified by our market survey and purchase frequency data. We utilize a centralized internal architectural group that designs homes to meet or exceed customers’ price-to-value expectations while being as efficient as possible to construct. To enhance the simplicity and efficiency of our products and processes, our architectural group has streamlined our product series and developed a core series of high-frequency, flexible floor plans and elevations that we can offer across many of our served markets. Our plan series allows us to more effectively shift with local demand and developable land attributes, helps us to better understand the cost to build our products and enables us to compare and implement best practices across divisions and communities. We also incorporate energy-efficient features into our product designs to help lower our homebuyers’ total cost of homeownership and reduce our homes’ impact on the environment, as further discussed below. 


• | Operations. In addition to differentiating us from other high-production homebuilders, our Built-to-Order process helps drive low-cost production. We generally commence construction of a home only after we have a signed purchase contract with a homebuyer and have obtained preliminary credit approval or other evidence of the homebuyer’s financial ability to purchase the home, and seek to build a backlog of sold homes. By maintaining a substantial backlog, along with centralized scheduling and standardized reporting processes, we have established a disciplined and scalable operational platform that helps us sustain an even-flow production of pre-sold homes. This reduces our inventory risk, promotes construction efficiencies and enhances our relationships with independent subcontractors and other business partners, and provides us with greater visibility and predictability on future deliveries as we grow. 

There may be market-driven circumstances where we believe it is necessary or appropriate to temporarily deviate from certain of the above principles. These deviations may include starting construction on a small number of homes in a community before corresponding purchase contracts are signed with homebuyers to more quickly meet customer delivery expectations and generate revenues; or acquiring land parcels in peripheral neighborhoods of a core metropolitan area that otherwise fit our growth strategy and meet our investment return standards. In addition, other circumstances could arise in the future that may lead us to make specific short-term shifts from these principles.
Improving Our Asset Efficiency. We have had an ongoing focus on, and will continue our efforts in 2019 toward, improving our asset efficiency, including, among other things, calibrating home sales rates and selling prices at each of our communities to enhance their profitability; controlling our direct construction costs within our communities; improving inventory turns; structuring land acquisitions to minimize upfront costs, as further discussed below under “Community Development and Land Inventory Management”; reactivating communities that have been held for future development; selling non-core assets; and deploying excess cash flow from operations to help fuel additional revenue growth and/or reduce debt. 
4

We have made considerable progress in reactivating communities over the past several years and plan to reactivate additional communities in 2019. As of November 30, 2018, our land held for future development or sale represented 7% of our total inventories, down from 11% at November 30, 2017 and down from its peak of 43% at November 30, 2011. Our objective is to reduce our land held for future development or sale, through reactivations and land sales, to less than 4% of our total inventory by the end of our 2019 fiscal year. 
While reactivations and land sales can have a negative impact on our homebuilding operating income margin, they are generally accretive to earnings and returns, and generate cash that we can redeploy for investments in land that are expected to generate a higher return and grow our business. Such growth should enable us to leverage greater operating efficiencies that are expected to accompany a larger scale. 
Monetizing Our Significant Deferred Tax Assets. By increasing our scale and further improving our asset efficiency, the anticipated associated revenue and pretax income growth will enable us to accelerate the utilization of our deferred tax assets, which totaled $441.8 million at November 30, 2018. We believe we can realize substantial tax cash savings through 2019 and beyond, and intend to productively deploy the cash to invest in our business and/or reduce debt.
Key Financial Targets. The 2019 financial targets under our Returns-Focused Growth Plan are as follows: 

• | Housing revenues greater than $5.0 billion.


• | Homebuilding operating income margin, excluding inventory-related charges, of 8.0% to 9.0%.


• | Return on invested capital in excess of 10.0%.


• | Return on equity of 10.0% to 15.0%.


• | Net debt to capital ratio of 35% to 45%.

Our progress towards achieving our Returns-Focused Growth Plan objectives is further discussed below under Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this report. 
Promotional Marketing Strategy. Building on our heritage of prioritizing our homebuyers’ interests and needs by offering them a distinct combination of affordability, choice and personalization among high-production homebuilders, in 2018 we launched a modern new logo and visual identity and adopted the tagline Built on Relationships® to reinforce the customer-centric philosophy of our longstanding operating model and the importance of other key relationships – with suppliers, trade contractors, land sellers and municipalities – to the success of our business. 
Our intense customer focus drives, among other things, how and where we acquire land for our new home communities; the design and selection of our products; our investments in, and choice of suppliers of, advanced materials, systems, equipment and technologies intended to enhance the performance and resource efficiency of our homes; and our community development and home construction methods and processes, as described in this report. In addition, we aim to present our homebuyers with a simple path to owning their unique new home with the assistance of our community team members who partner closely with each homebuyer through each major step in the design, construction and closing of their home. We believe our approach sets us apart from most other homebuilders and from resale homes, and is particularly well suited for the current and future generations of first-time buyers – historically our core customer demographic. 
Homebuyer Profile. We focus on bracketing within a range around the median household income in a submarket in order to position our product and pricing to be attainable for the largest demand segments of that submarket. Across our portfolio, we offer an array of products, from smaller, higher density homes, with lower price points typically suited for first-time homebuyers, to larger homes in premium locations with additional amenities, with higher price points that generally attract a first or second move-up homebuyer. We also offer a variety of single-story floorplans that typically appeal to an active adult homebuyer age 55 and over, as well as multi-story floorplans that attract a wide range of homebuyers. Approximately 75% of our annual deliveries for more than a decade have been to first-time and first move-up homebuyers; in 2018, it was 74% of our deliveries, as shown in the chart below:

To help elevate the KB Home brand in the marketplace, particularly for the growing number of millennial homebuyers, our promotional marketing efforts increasingly involve digital marketing, including interactive Internet-based applications, social media outlets and other evolving communication technologies. 
Customer Service.  Our on-site construction supervisors perform regular pre-closing quality checks and our sales representatives maintain regular contact with our homebuyers during the home construction process in an effort to ensure our homes meet our standards and our homebuyers’ expectations. We also have employees who are responsible for responding to homebuyers’ post-closing needs, including warranty claims. Information about our limited warranty program is provided in Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. 
Operational Structure. We operate our homebuilding business through divisions with experienced management teams who have in-depth local knowledge of their particular served markets, which helps us acquire land in preferred locations; develop communities with products that meet local demand; and understand local regulatory environments. Our division management teams exercise considerable autonomy in identifying land acquisition opportunities; developing land and communities; implementing product, marketing and sales strategies; and controlling costs. To help maintain consistent execution within the organization, our division management teams and other employees are continuously trained on KB2020 principles and are evaluated, in part, based on their achievement of relevant operational objectives. 
Our corporate management and support personnel develop and oversee the implementation of company-wide strategic initiatives, our overall operational policies and internal control standards, and perform various centralized functions, including architecture; purchasing and national contracts; treasury and cash management; land acquisition approval; risk and litigation management; accounting and financial reporting; internal audit and compliance activities; information technology systems; marketing; and investor and media relations. Corporate management is responsible for, among other things, evaluating and selecting the geographic markets in which we operate, consistent with our overall business strategy; allocating capital resources to markets for land acquisition and development activities; making major personnel decisions related to employee compensation and benefits; and monitoring the financial and operational performance of our divisions. Our corporate management also facilitates the sharing and implementation of best practices companywide.
Community Development and Land Inventory Management
Developable land for the production of homes is a core resource for our business. Based on our current strategic plans, we seek to own or control land sufficient to meet our forecasted production goals for the next three to five years. In 2019, we intend to continue to invest in and develop land positions within attractive submarkets and selectively acquire or control additional land that meets our investment return standards. However, we may decide to sell certain land interests or monetize land previously held for future development as part of our Returns-Focused Growth Plan, or for other reasons. 
Our community development process generally consists of four phases: land acquisition, land development into finished lots for a community (if necessary), home construction and delivery of completed homes to homebuyers. Historically, our community development process has typically ranged from six to 24 months in our West Coast homebuilding reporting segment, with a somewhat shorter duration in our other homebuilding reporting segments. The development process in our West Coast homebuilding reporting segment is typically longer than in our other segments due to the municipal and regulatory requirements that are generally more stringent in California. Our community development process varies based on, among other things, the extent and speed of 
6

required government approvals and utility service activations, the overall size of a particular community, the scope of necessary site preparation activities, the type of product(s) that will be offered, weather conditions, time of year, promotional marketing results, the availability of construction resources, consumer demand, local and general economic and housing market conditions, and other factors. 
Although they vary significantly in size and complexity, our single-family residential home communities typically consist of 50 to 200 lots ranging in size from 1,500 to 11,000 square feet. In our communities, we typically offer three to 15 home design choices. We also generally build one to three model homes at each community so that prospective homebuyers can preview the various products available. Depending on the community, we may offer premium lots containing more square footage, better views and/or location benefits. Some of our communities consist of multiple-story structures that encompass several attached condominium-style units.
Land Acquisition and Land Development. We continuously evaluate land acquisition opportunities against our investment return standards, while also balancing competing needs for financial strength, liquidity and land inventory for future growth. When we acquire land, we generally focus on parcels with lots that are entitled for residential construction and are either physically developed to start home construction (referred to as “finished lots”) or partially finished. However, depending on market conditions and available opportunities, we may acquire undeveloped and/or unentitled land. We may also invest in land that requires us to repurpose and re-entitle the property for residential use, such as in-fill developments. We expect that the overall balance of undeveloped, unentitled, entitled, partially finished and finished lots in our inventory will vary over time, and in implementing our strategic growth initiatives, we may acquire a greater proportion of undeveloped or unentitled land in the future if and as the availability of reasonably priced land with finished or partially finished lots diminishes. 
We generally structure our land acquisition and land development activities to minimize, or to defer the timing of, expenditures in order to reduce both the market risks associated with holding land and our working capital and financial commitments, including interest and other carrying costs. We typically use contracts that, in exchange for a small initial option payment or earnest money deposit, give us an option or similar right to acquire land at a future date, usually at a pre-determined price and pending our satisfaction with the feasibility of developing and selling homes on the land and/or an underlying land seller’s completion of certain obligations, such as securing entitlements, developing infrastructure or finishing lots. We refer to land subject to such option or similar contractual rights as being “controlled.” Our decision to exercise a particular land option or similar right is based on the results of our due diligence and continued market viability analysis after entering into such a contract. Information related to our land option contracts and other similar contracts is provided in Note 7 – Inventory Impairments and Land Option Contract Abandonments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.
The following table presents the number of inventory lots we owned, in various stages of development, or controlled under land option contracts or other similar contracts by homebuilding reporting segment as of November 30, 2018 and 2017:

Home Construction and Deliveries. Following the acquisition of land and, if necessary, the development of the land into finished lots, we typically begin constructing model homes and marketing homes for sale. To minimize the costs and risks of unsold homes in production, we generally commence construction of a home only after we have a signed purchase contract with a homebuyer and have obtained preliminary credit approval or other evidence of the homebuyer’s financial ability to purchase the home. However, cancellations of home purchase contracts prior to the delivery of the underlying homes, the construction of attached products with some unsold units, or specific strategic considerations will result in our having unsold completed or partially completed homes in our inventory. Our construction cycle time from home sale to delivery is typically five to six months.
We act as the general contractor for the majority of our communities, and engage outside general contractors in all other instances. We, or the outside general contractors we engage, contract with a variety of independent subcontractors, who are typically locally based, to perform all land development and home construction work through their own employees or subcontractors. We do not self-perform any land development or home construction work. These independent subcontractors also supply some of the building materials required for such production activities. Our contracts with these independent subcontractors require that they comply with all laws applicable to their work, including wage and safety laws, meet performance standards, and follow local building codes and permits. 
Raw Materials. Outside of land, the principal raw materials used in our production process are concrete and forest products. Other primary materials used in home construction include drywall, and plumbing and electrical items. We source all of our building materials from third parties. We attempt to enhance the efficiency of our operations by using, where practical, standardized materials that are commercially available on competitive terms from a variety of outside sources. In addition, we have national and regional purchasing programs for certain building materials, appliances, fixtures and other items that allow us to benefit from large-quantity purchase discounts and, where available, participate in outside manufacturer or supplier rebate programs. When possible, we arrange for bulk purchases of these products at favorable prices from such manufacturers and suppliers. Although our purchasing strategies have helped us in negotiating favorable prices for raw materials, in recent years we have encountered higher prices for certain raw materials. 
Backlog
Our “backlog” consists of homes that are under a purchase contract but have not yet been delivered to a homebuyer. Ending backlog represents the number of homes in backlog from the previous period plus the number of net orders (new orders for homes less cancellations) generated during the current period minus the number of homes delivered during the current period. Our backlog at any given time will be affected by cancellations, homes delivered and our community count. Our cancellation rates and the factors affecting such rates are further discussed below in both Item 1A – Risk Factors and Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this report.

The following charts present our ending backlog (number of homes and value) by homebuilding reporting segment as of November 30, 2017 and 2018: 
Employees
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had approximately 2,005 and 1,915 full-time employees, respectively. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Competition, Seasonality, Delivery Mix and Other Factors
Competition. The homebuilding industry and housing market are highly competitive with respect to selling homes; contracting for construction services, such as carpentry, roofing, electrical and plumbing; and acquiring attractive developable land, though the intensity of competition can vary and fluctuate between and within individual markets and submarkets. We compete for homebuyers, construction resources and desirable land against numerous homebuilders, ranging from regional and national firms to small local enterprises. As to homebuyers, we primarily compete with other homebuilders on the basis of selling price, community location and amenities, availability of financing options, home designs, reputation, home construction cycle time, and the design options and upgrades that can be included in a home. In some cases, this competition occurs within larger residential development projects containing separate sections designed, planned and developed by other homebuilders. We also compete for homebuyers against housing alternatives to new homes, including resale homes, apartments, single-family rentals and other rental housing. In markets experiencing heavy construction activity, including areas recovering from wildfires, hurricanes or other significant natural disasters, there can be severe craft and skilled trade shortages that limit independent subcontractors’ ability to supply construction services to us, which in turn tends to drive up our costs and/or extend our production schedules. Elevated construction activity has also contributed to measurable increases in the amount of time to obtain governmental approvals or utility service activations; and, combined with tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions recently imposed or increased by the U.S. and other governments, the cost of certain building materials, such as steel, lumber, drywall and concrete. Since 2013, we also have seen higher prices for desirable land amid heightened competition with homebuilders and other developers and investors (both domestic and international), particularly in the land-constrained areas where we operate. We expect these upward cost trends to continue in 2019, if and as housing market activity grows and there is greater competition for these resources. 
Seasonality. Our performance is affected by seasonal demand trends for housing. Traditionally, there has been more consumer demand for home purchases and we tend to generate more net orders in the spring and early summer months (corresponding to most of our second quarter and part of our third quarter) than at other times of the year. This “selling season” demand results in 
9

our delivering more homes and generating higher revenues from late summer through the fall months (corresponding to part of our third quarter and all of our fourth quarter), as illustrated in the following table: 

 | First Quarter | | Second Quarter | | Third Quarter | Fourth Quarter
Net Orders | | | | | | 
2018 | 25 | % | | 32 | % | 25 | % | 18 | %
2017 | 24 | % | | 31 | % | 24 | % | 21 | %
2016 | 22 | % | | 32 | % | 24 | % | 22 | %
Homes Delivered | | | | | | 
2018 | 20 | % | | 24 | % | 26 | % | 30 | %
2017 | 20 | % | | 24 | % | 25 | % | 31 | %
2016 | 20 | % | | 24 | % | 25 | % | 31 | %
Housing Revenues | | | | | | 
2018 | 19 | % | | 24 | % | 27 | % | 30 | %
2017 | 19 | % | | 23 | % | 26 | % | 32 | %
2016 | 19 | % | | 23 | % | 25 | % | 33 | %

Delivery Mix and Other Factors. In addition to the overall volume of homes we sell and deliver, our results in a given period are significantly affected by the geographic mix of markets and submarkets in which we operate; the number and characteristics of the communities we have open for sales in those markets and submarkets; and the products we sell from those communities during the period. While there are some similarities, there are differences within and between our served markets in terms of the quantity, size and nature of the communities we operate and the products we offer to consumers. These differences reflect, among other things, local homebuyer preferences; household demographics (e.g., large families or working professionals; income levels); geographic context (e.g., urban or suburban; availability of reasonably priced finished lots; development constraints; residential density); and the shifts that can occur in these factors over time. These factors in each of our served markets will affect the costs we incur and the time it takes to locate, acquire rights to and develop land, open communities for sales, and market and build homes; the size of our homes; our selling prices (including the contribution from homebuyers’ purchases of design options and upgrades); the pace at which we sell and deliver homes and close out communities; and our housing gross profits and housing gross profit margins. Therefore, our results in any given period will fluctuate compared to other periods based on the proportion of homes delivered from areas with higher or lower selling prices and on the corresponding land and overhead costs incurred to generate those deliveries, as well as from our overall community count. 
Financing
Our operations have historically been funded by internally generated cash flows, public equity and debt issuances, land option contracts and other similar contracts, land seller financing, and performance bonds and letters of credit. We also have the ability to borrow funds under our unsecured revolving credit facility with various banks (“Credit Facility”). Depending on market conditions and available opportunities, we may obtain project financing, or secure external financing with community or other inventory assets that we own or control. By “project financing,” we mean loans that are specifically obtained for, or secured by, particular communities or other inventory assets. We may also arrange or engage in bank loan, project debt or other financial transactions and/or expand the capacity of the Credit Facility or our cash-collateralized letter of credit facility with a financial institution (the “LOC Facility”) or enter into additional such facilities.

As part of our due diligence process for land acquisitions, we often use third-party environmental consultants to investigate potential environmental risks, and we require disclosures, representations and warranties from land sellers regarding environmental risks. We may, from time to time, acquire property that requires us to incur environmental clean-up costs after conducting appropriate due diligence, including, but not limited to, using detailed investigations performed by environmental consultants. In such instances, we take steps prior to our acquisition of the land to gain reasonable assurance as to the precise scope of work required and the costs associated with removal, site restoration and/or monitoring. To the extent contamination or other environmental issues have occurred in the past, we will attempt to recover restoration costs from third parties, such as the generators of hazardous waste, land sellers or others in the prior chain of title and/or their insurers. Based on these practices, we anticipate that it is unlikely that environmental clean-up costs will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. However, despite these efforts, there can be no assurance that we will avoid material liabilities relating to the existence or removal of toxic wastes, site restoration, monitoring or other environmental matters affecting properties currently or previously owned or controlled by us, and no estimate of any potential liabilities can be made. We have not been notified by any governmental agency of any claim that any of the properties owned or formerly owned by us are identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (or similar state or local agency) as being a “Superfund” (or similar state or local) clean-up site requiring remediation, which could have a material effect on our future consolidated financial statements. Costs associated with the use of environmental consultants are not material to our consolidated financial statements. 
We have made a dedicated effort to further differentiate ourselves from other homebuilders and resale homes through our ongoing commitment to become a leading national company in environmental sustainability. We continually seek out and utilize innovative technologies and systems to further improve the energy and water efficiency of our homes, as well as engage in campaigns and other educational efforts, sometimes together with other companies, organizations and groups, to increase consumer awareness of the importance and impact of sustainability in selecting a home and the products within a home. Under our commitment to sustainability, we, among other things:

• | build energy- and water-efficient new homes. We built our 115,000th ENERGY STAR® certified home in 2018; 


• | developed a KB Home Energy Performance Guide®, or EPG®, that informs our homebuyers of the relative energy efficiency and the related estimated monthly energy costs of each of our homes as designed, compared to typical new and existing homes;


• | include in our product offerings advanced home automation technologies, components and systems that can increase convenience for our homebuyers. For instance, in 2018, we partnered with Google® to offer KB Smart Home System-enabled homes in certain communities, which allows homeowners to control the functionality of their smart KB homes with advanced connectivity and integrated technology features; and 


• | created and continue to add more net-zero energy and zero freshwater design options, under a program called Double ZeroHouse™ 3.0, that are available in select markets.

For several years, we have been recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for our sustainability achievements, and have earned awards under all of the agency’s programs aimed at homebuilders: ENERGY STAR, which sets energy efficiency standards; WaterSense®, which establishes water efficiency standards; and Indoor airPLUS®, which focuses on indoor air quality. In 2018, we received the ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year — Sustained Excellence Award for the eighth consecutive year, and the WaterSense Sustained Excellence Award for water efficiency for the fourth consecutive year.
More information about our sustainability commitment can be found in our annual sustainability reports, which we have published on our website since 2008. We intend to continue to research, evaluate and utilize new or improved products and construction and business practices consistent with our commitment and believe our sustainability initiatives can help put us in a better position, compared to resale homes and homebuilders with less-developed programs, to comply with evolving local, state and federal rules and regulations intended to protect natural resources and to address climate change and similar environmental concerns.
