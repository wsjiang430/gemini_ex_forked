ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
We are a diversified real estate development and agribusiness company committed to responsibly using our land and resources to meet the housing, employment, and lifestyle needs of Californians and create value for our shareholders. Current operations consist of land planning and entitlement, land development, commercial land sales and leasing, leasing of land for mineral royalties, water asset management and sales, grazing leases, farming, and ranch operations.
These activities are performed through our five reporting segments:
Our prime asset is approximately 270,000 acres of contiguous, largely undeveloped land that, at its most southerly border, is 60 miles north of downtown Los Angeles and, at its most northerly border, is 15 miles east of Bakersfield. We create value by securing entitlements for our land, facilitating infrastructure development, strategic land planning, monetization of land through development and sales, and conservation in order to maximize the highest and best use for our land. We are involved in eight joint ventures, that either own, develop, and/or operate real estate properties. We enter into joint ventures as a means to facilitate the development of portions of our land.

Business Objectives and Strategies
Our primary business objective is to maximize long-term shareholder value through the monetization of our land-based assets.  A key element of our strategy is to entitle and then develop large-scale mixed use master planned residential and commercial/industrial real estate projects to serve the growing populations of Southern and Central California.  Our mixed use master planned residential developments have been, or are in the process of being, approved or re-approved, to collectively include up to 34,783 housing units, and more than 35 million square feet of commercial space. We have obtained entitlements on Mountain Village at Tejon Ranch, or MV, and in litigation regarding the entitlements for Grapevine at Tejon Ranch, or Grapevine. During December 2018, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisor voted in favor of our plan to develop Centennial at Tejon Ranch, or Centennial, taking an additional step toward approving the mixed use residential community. We are currently engaged in entitlement, construction, commercial sales and leasing at our fully operational commercial/industrial center Tejon Ranch Commerce Center, or TRCC. All of these efforts are supported by diverse revenue streams generated from other operations, including commercial real estate, farming, mineral resources, and our various joint ventures.

Real Estate Development Overview
Our real estate operations consist of the following activities: real estate development, commercial land sales and leasing, land planning and entitlement, and conservation.
Interstate 5, one of the nation’s most heavily traveled freeways, brings in excess of 88,000 vehicles per day through our land, which includes 16 miles of Interstate 5 frontage on each side of the freeway and the commercial land surrounding three interchanges. The strategic plan for real estate focuses on development opportunities along the Interstate 5 and Highway 138 corridors, which includes TRCC in Kern County, Centennial, a mixed use master planned community on our land in Los Angeles County, MV, a resort and residential community in Kern County, and Grapevine, a mixed use master planned community on our land in Kern County. TRCC includes developments east and west of Interstate 5 at TRCC-East and TRCC-West, respectively. 
The chart below is a continuum of the real estate development process highlighting each project's current status and key milestones to be met in moving through the real estate development process in California. During this process, we may experience delays arising from factors beyond our control. Such factors include litigation and a changing regulatory environment.

Our real estate activities within our commercial/industrial segment include: entitling, planning, and permitting of land for development; construction of infrastructure; the construction of pre-leased buildings; the construction of buildings to be leased or sold; and the sale of land to third parties for their own development. The commercial/industrial segment also includes activities related to communications leases, and landscape maintenance fees. Our real estate operations within our resort/residential segment at this time include costs for land entitlement, land planning and pre-construction engineering, and land stewardship and conservation activities.

Operating Segments
Real Estate - Commercial/Industrial
During 2018, approval for expansion of the Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) was granted by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The expanded FTZ now covers all the industrial sites within TRCC, an area totaling 1,094 acres. The FTZ designation allows the user to secure the many benefits and cost reductions associated with streamlined movement of goods in and out of the zone. This FTZ designation is further supplemented by the Economic Development Incentive Policy, or EDIP, adopted by the Kern County Board of Supervisors. EDIP is aimed to expand and enhance the County's competitiveness by taking affirmative steps to attract new businesses and to encourage the growth and resilience of existing businesses. The EDIP provides incentives such as assistance in obtaining state tax incentives, building supporting infrastructure, and workforce development.
Construction:
During 2018, we formed TRC-MRC 3, a joint venture with Majestic Realty Co., or Majestic, a Los Angeles-based commercial/industrial developer, to pursue the development, construction, leasing, and management of a 579,040 square foot industrial building at TRCC-East. We anticipate construction completion and delivery of the space in the fourth quarter of 2019 to a tenant that has entered into a lease agreement occupying 67% of the total rentable space.
We also began development on a new 4,900 square foot multi-tenant retail building at TRCC-East to further expand our footprint at TRCC. We anticipate completion of a dark shell, a commercial building with an unfinished interior, in the third quarter of 2019.
During 2017, our TRC-MRC 1 joint venture with Majestic completed the construction of a 480,480 square foot distribution facility. The facility was fully leased in 2018, with half of the space leased to Dollar General and the other half to SalonCentric, L’Oréal USA’s professional salon distribution operation.

Commercial/industrial real estate sales:
The commercial/industrial real estate sales market is highly competitive, with competition throughout California. Our most direct regional competitors are in the Inland Empire, a large industrial area located 60 miles east of Los Angeles, which continues its expansion eastward beyond Riverside and San Bernardino into the Perris, Moreno Valley, and Beaumont regions of Southern California. We also face competition within Northern Los Angeles, which is comprised of the San Fernando Valley and Santa Clarita Valley along with areas north of us in the San Joaquin Valley of California. The principal factors of competition in this industry are price, availability of labor, proximity to the port complexes of Los Angeles and Long Beach and customer base. A potential disadvantage to our development strategy is our distance from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in comparison to the warehouses and distribution centers located in the West Inland Empire. Strong demand for large distribution facilities is driving development farther east in a search for large entitled parcels. 
During 2018, vacancy rates in the Inland Empire stayed flat at 3.9% compared to 3.7% in 2017. This industrial market continues to see available supply remain at historic low levels. Construction declined slightly during the fourth quarter with 20.5 million square feet under construction compared to 20.7 million in 2017. This new supply is currently meeting growing industrial demand. The low vacancy rates have led to a year-over-year increase in lease rates of 7.3% within the Inland Empire. As lease rates increase in the Inland Empire, we may begin to have greater pricing advantages due to our lower land basis.
During 2018, vacancy rates in the northern Los Angeles industrial market, which includes the San Fernando Valley and Santa Clarita Valley, approximated 1.6% compared to 1.7% in 2017. Rents have been increasing for the past six years and will likely continue to rise in future years as the vacancy rate is at historic lows and quality industrial space remains hard to find. During 2018, average asking rents increased 8.5% compared with 2017, which have surpassed the historical peak which was seen in late 2007. Industrial demand remains high and infill industrial demand remains higher still. Future quarters will likely see greater construction activity as rents hit new highs and vacancy rates are at historic lows. Demand for industrial space in this market will also continue to be driven by domestic and global consumption levels. As industrial vacancy rates are at historic lows, industrial users seeking larger spaces are having to go further north into neighboring Kern County and particularly, TRCC which has attracted increased attention as market conditions continue to tighten. 
In 2018, the Los Angeles and Long Beach Port container traffic recorded its highest container total ever with 17.54 million Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units, or TEU's, up 3.8% from 2017. TEU is a measure of a ship's cargo carrying capacity. The dimensions of one TEU are equal to that of a standard shipping container measuring 20 feet long by 8 feet tall.
Joint Ventures: 
During 2018, we formed TRC-MRC 3, a joint venture with Majestic to pursue the development, construction, leasing, and management of a 579,040 square foot industrial building on the Company's property at TRCC-East. We anticipate construction completion in 2019, and plan to deliver the space in the fourth quarter of 2019 to a tenant that has entered into a lease agreement to occupy 67% of this rentable space.
During 2016, we entered into a joint venture operating agreement with Majestic to pursue the development, construction, leasing, and management of a 480,480 square foot industrial building on the Company’s property at TRCC-East. The facility was fully leased up in 2018, with half of the space leased to Dollar General and the other half to SalonCentric, L’Oréal USA’s professional salon distribution operation. In addition, we entered into a second joint venture operating agreement with Majestic for the purchase of, ownership of, and management of a fully leased, 651,909 square foot industrial building located at TRCC-West. 
Our joint venture with TravelCenters of America, or TA/Petro, owns and operates two travel and truck stop facilities, restaurants, and five separate gas stations with convenience stores within TRCC-West and TRCC-East. 
We are involved in three joint ventures with Rockefeller Development Group, which includes the following: Five West Parcel LLC, which owns a 606,000 square foot building in TRCC-West that is fully leased to Dollar General, 18-19 West LLC, which owns 61.5 acres of land for future development within TRCC-West, and TRCC/Rock Outlet Center LLC, which operates the Outlets at Tejon.
Leasing:
Within our commercial/industrial segment, we lease land to various types of tenants. We currently lease land to two auto service stations with convenience stores, 13 fast-food operations, two full-service restaurants, a motel, an antique shop, and a post office.

Real Estate - Resort/Residential
Our resort/residential segment activities include land entitlement, land planning and pre-construction engineering, and land stewardship and conservation activities. We have three major resort/residential communities within this segment:

• | MV, which has entitlement approvals and approved tentative tract map for the first four phases of residential development;


• | Centennial, which has zoning and land use designation within the Antelope Valley Area Plan, or AVAP, and the Los Angeles County General Plan, and is completing the specific plan process in LA County. The AVAP is designed to guide future development and conservation in the northern-most region of unincorporated Los Angeles County. Centennial is included in the AVAP as part of the west Economic Opportunity Area, or EOA, where future development would be directed. In December 2018, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors' voted in favor of the LA County Specific Plan, taking an additional step toward approving the community; and 


• | Grapevine, which is on land owned within Kern County received entitlement approvals in 2016. On December 11, 2018, the court ruled we have to amend our EIR by preparing supplemental environmental documentation to further analyze the Grapevine project’s internal capture rate (ICR), which is the percent of vehicle trips remaining within the project. The supplemental environmental documentation will include updated traffic, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, noise, public health and growth inducing impact analyses. As a part of the process Kern County will work with us to correct the EIR and re-approve the project. See Note 14, (Commitments and Contingencies) for further discussion. 

The entitlement process precedes the regulatory approvals necessary for land development and routinely takes several years to complete. The Conservation Agreement we entered into with five major environmental organizations in 2008 is designed to minimize opposition from environmental groups to these projects and eliminate or reduce the time spent in litigation once governmental approvals are received. Litigation by environmental and other special interest groups have been a primary cause of delays and increased costs for real estate development projects in California.
As we embark on our mixed use master planned communities, we understand that it can take up to 25 years, or longer, to complete from commencement of construction. The entitlement process for development of property in California is complex, lengthy (spanning multiple years) and costly, involving numerous federal, state, and county regulatory approvals. We are unable to determine anticipated completion dates for our real estate development projects with certainty because the time for completion is heavily dependent on the regulatory approvals necessary for land development. Also, as a real estate developer, we are cognizant of the micro- and macro-economic factors that have a significant influence on the real estate sector. As a developer, one would be at an economic disadvantage to bring product to market with no willing or able buyers. This ebb and flow of the economy also plays into the timing of our completion date. Costs will also fluctuate over the life of these projects as a result of the cost of labor and raw materials and the timing of approvals and other activity. The uncertainty of estimated costs to completion is compounded by the potential impact of inflation, which will fluctuate with the equally uncertain completion dates for our projects.

Mountain Village at Tejon Ranch:
MV is planned to be an exclusive, low-density, resort-based community that will provide owners and guests with a wide variety of recreational opportunities, lodging and spa facilities, putting greens, a range of housing options, and other exclusive services and amenities that are designed to distinguish MV as the resort community of choice for the Southern California market. MV is being developed by Tejon Mountain Village LLC, or TMV LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. MV encompasses 5,082 acres for a mixed use development to include housing, retail, and commercial components. MV is entitled for 3,450 homes, 160,000 square feet of commercial development, 750 hotel keys, and more than 21,335 acres of open space.
We are working toward delivering the first phase of the 160,000 square foot commercial center that we call Farm Village. Farm Village will serve as the commercial center and community gathering place for MV residents and visitors, as well as the gateway to MV. Farm Village will include fresh culinary offerings, artisan markets, boutique lodging, and an array of trails, gardens, and agriculture that will be intertwined to create the most unique, relaxing and “edu-taining” experience while fulfilling the needs of residents of MV. In January 2018, we obtained approval from Kern County on the first phase of the Farm Village. 
During December 2017, the Company received approval of Tentative Tract Maps for the first four phases of residential units of MV. 
In 2014, the Company acquired full ownership of TMV LLC through the purchase of DMB TMV LLC's interest in the former joint venture for $70,000,000 in cash. 
The Company's decision to obtain full ownership of MV reflects the Company's growth as a fully integrated real estate company and demonstrates our belief in the future success of the development. 
MV is fully entitled and all necessary permits have been issued to begin development once the mapping process is complete. Timing of MV development in the coming years will be dependent on the strength of both the economy and the residential real estate market. In moving the project forward, we will focus on the preparation of engineering leading to the final map for the first phases of MV, consumer and market research studies and fine tuning of development business plans as well as defining the capital funding sources for this development. Over the next several years, we expect to explore funding opportunities for future development of MV.  Such funding opportunities could come from a variety of sources, such as joint ventures with financial partners, debt financing, or the Company’s issuance of common stock.
Centennial at Tejon Ranch:
The Centennial development is a mixed use master planned community development encompassing 12,323 acres of our land within Los Angeles County. Upon completion of Centennial, it is estimated that the community will include 19,333 homes and 10.1 million square feet of commercial development. Centennial will also incorporate business districts, schools, retail and entertainment centers, medical facilities and other commercial office and light industrial businesses that, when complete, will create a substantial number of jobs. Centennial is being developed by Centennial Founders, LLC, a consolidated joint venture in which we have a 83.50% ownership interest as of December 31, 2018. Centennial is envisioned to be an ecologically friendly and commercially viable development. 
In December 2018, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors took action to approve the specific plan and development agreement for Centennial by a vote of 4-1. Upon final approval and finding of facts, the 19,333 residential units will be fully entitled and is expected to occur during the first half of 2019.
In 2016, Lewis Investment Company withdrew from the joint venture. The surviving members (TRC, TRI Pointe Homes and CalAtlantic) absorbed the equity of Lewis Investment Company based on their respective proportionate interest in the joint venture at the time of the withdrawal. In 2018, CalAtlantic also withdrew from the joint venture. The surviving members (TRC and TRI Pointe Homes, Inc.) absorbed the equity of CalAtlantic based on their respective proportionate interest in the joint venture at the time of the withdrawal. Both withdrawals were deemed an equity transaction between members and had no earnings impact to the Company. 
During 2014, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved the AVAP. The AVAP is designed to guide future development and conservation in the northern-most region of unincorporated Los Angeles County. Centennial is included in the AVAP as part of the west Economic Opportunity Area, or EOA, where future development would be directed. This particular EOA is located along Highway 138 and encompasses the vast majority of Centennial's proposed boundaries. In June 2015, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors gave final approval for the AVAP. The AVAP provides Centennial with land use designation and zoning for residential and commercial development.
18

Grapevine at Tejon Ranch:
Grapevine is a 15,315-acre development area located on the San Joaquin Valley floor area of our lands, adjacent to TRCC. The 2008 Conservation Agreement allows for the development of up to 12,400 acres in this area. We are currently focusing on 8,010 acres for a mixed use development to include housing, retail, and commercial industrial components. Grapevine has received approval for 12,000 homes, 5.1 million square feet for commercial development, and more than 3,367 acres of open space and parks. On December 6, 2016, the Kern County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved the specific plan and the Environmental Impact Report, or EIR, for the development of the Grapevine community, which included approval for land use designation, zoning and a development agreement. On December 11, 2018 the court ruled that portions of the EIR required corrections and ordered that the County rescind the Grapevine project approvals until such supplemental environmental analysis was completed.  The Company will file new applications to re-entitle the Grapevine project (“re-entitlement”) in 2019. See Note 14, (Commitments and Contingencies) for further discussion.
The greatest competition for the Centennial and Grapevine communities will come from California developments in the Santa Clarita Valley, Lancaster, Palmdale, and Bakersfield. The developments in these areas will be providing similar housing product as our developments. The principal factors of competition in this industry are pricing of product, amenities offered, and location. We will attempt to differentiate our developments through our unique setting, land planning and different product offerings. MV will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreational and residential homes.
The following is a summary of the Company's residential real estate developments as of December 31, 2018:

Community: | Mountain Village | Grapevine | Centennial | Resort 
Location: | Kern County | Kern County | Los Angeles County | Residential
Project Status1: | Entitled | Re-Entitlement | Pending Approval | Total 
Entitlement Area (acres): | 26,417 | 8,010 | 12,323 | 46,750 
Housing Units: | 3,450 | 12,000 | 19,333 | 34,783 
Commercial Development (sqft)2: | 160,000 | 5,100,000 | 10,100,000 | 15,360,000 
Open Areas (acres): | 21,335 | 3,367 | 5,624 | 30,326 
Costs to Date3: | $137,571 | $31,175 | $100,311 | $269,057 

(1) Estimated completion anticipated to be 25 years, or longer, from commencement of construction. To-date construction has not begun.
(2) MV also has approval for up to 750 lodging units and 350,000 square feet of facilities in support of two 18-hole golf courses.
(3) Total estimated project costs are difficult to accurately forecast with any certainty at this time due to finalization of entitlement and mapping processes, as well as final engineering for the developments, and capital funding structure selected. Dollars presented in thousands.
Mineral Resources
Mineral resources consist of oil and gas royalties, rock and aggregate royalties, royalties from a cement operation leased to National Cement Company of California, Inc., or National, and the management of water assets and water infrastructure. We continue to look for opportunities to grow our mineral resource revenues through expansion of leasing and encouraging new exploration. Within our water assets, we are expanding our resources through new well drilling programs, while at the same time looking for opportunities to continue to purchase water as we have in the past. We look to sell excess water over our internal needs on a temporary basis until that water is needed by us in our real estate and agricultural operations.
We do not expect increased oil production in 2019 if prices remain at current levels. Water sales opportunities for 2019 will depend on rain and snowfall volume along with California State Water Project, or SWP, allocations. As of February 20, 2019, the 2019 SWP allocation is at 35% of entitled amounts.
We lease certain portions of our land to oil companies for the exploration and production of oil and gas. We however do not engage in any oil exploration or extraction activities. As of December 31, 2018, 10,332 acres were committed to producing oil and gas leases from which the operators produced and sold approximately 250,000 barrels of oil and 241,000 MCF (each MCF being 1,000 cubic feet) of dry gas during 2018. Our share of production, based upon average royalty rates during the last three years, has been 92, 99, and 114, barrels of oil per day for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. There are 309 active oil wells located on the leased land as of December 31, 2018. Royalty rates on our leases averaged approximately 13% of oil production in 2018.

Estimates of oil and gas reserves on our properties are unknown to us. We do not make such estimates, and our lessees do not make information concerning reserves available to us.
We have approximately 2,000 acres under lease to National, for the purpose of manufacturing Portland cement from limestone deposits found on the leased acreage. National owns and operates a cement manufacturing plant on our property with a capacity of approximately 1,000,000 tons of cement per year. The amount of payment that we receive under the lease is based upon shipments from the cement plant, which increased during 2018 compared to 2017. The improvement in shipments is due to an increase in road construction activity as compared to the prior years. The term of this lease expires in 2026, but National has options to extend the term for successive periods of 20 and 19 years. Proceedings under environmental laws relating to the cement plant are in process. The Company is indemnified by the current and former tenants, and at this time, we have no cost related to the issues at the cement plant. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” for a further discussion. 
We also lease 521 acres to Granite Construction and Griffith Construction for the mining of rock and aggregate product that is used in construction of roads and bridges. The royalty revenues we receive under these leases are based upon the amount of product produced at these sites.
Our royalty interests are contractually defined and based on a percentage of production and are received in cash. Our royalty revenues fluctuate based on changes in the market prices for oil, natural gas, and rock and aggregate product, the inevitable decline in production of existing wells and quarries, and other factors affecting the third-party oil and natural gas exploration and production companies that operate on our lands including the cost of development and production. 
In August 2015, we entered into a water sale agreement with PEF, our current lessee under a power plant lease. Beginning in 2016, PEF may purchase from us up to 2,000 acre-feet of water and from January 2017 through July 2030, PEF may purchase from us up to 3,500 acre feet of water per year, with an option to extend the term. PEF is under no obligation to purchase water from us in any year, but is required to pay us an annual option payment equal to 30% of the maximum annual payment. The price of the water under the agreement is $1,120 per acre-foot of annual water in 2019, subject to 3% annual increases for the duration of the lease agreement. The Company's commitments to sell this water can be met through current water sources.
Farming Operations
In the San Joaquin Valley, we farm permanent crops including the following acreage: wine grapes—1,197; almonds—1,966 (1,214 in production and 752 not in production); and pistachios—1,062. We manage the farming of alfalfa and forage mix on 775 acres in the Antelope Valley, and we periodically lease 1,000 acres of land that is used for the growing of vegetables but also can be used for the development of permanent crops such as almonds.
We sell our farm commodities to several commercial buyers. As a producer of these commodities, we are in direct competition with other producers within the United States, or U.S., and throughout the world. Prices we receive for our commodities are determined by total industry production and demand levels. We attempt to improve price margins by producing high quality crops through proven cultural practices and by obtaining better prices through marketing arrangements with handlers.
Sales of our grape crop typically occur in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year, while sales of our pistachio and almond crops also typically occur in the third and fourth quarter of the calendar year, but can occur up to a year or more after each crop is harvested.
In 2018, we sold 62% of our grape crop to one winery, 23% to a second winery and the remainder to two other customers. These sales are under long-term contracts ranging from one to 12 years. In 2018, our almonds were sold to various commercial buyers, with the largest buyer accounting for 54% of our almond revenues. We sold pistachios to three customers with the largest accounting for 73% of our pistachio revenues. We do not believe that we would be adversely affected by the loss of any or all of these large buyers because of the markets for these commodities, the large number of buyers that would be available to us, and the fact that the prices for these commodities do not vary based on the identity of the buyer or the size of the contract.
Our almond, pistachio, and wine grape crop sales are highly seasonal with a majority of our sales occurring during the third and fourth quarters. Nut and grape crop markets are particularly sensitive to the size of each year’s world crop and the demand for those crops. Large crops in California and abroad can rapidly depress prices. Crop prices, especially almonds, are also adversely affected by a strong U.S. dollar which makes U.S. exports more expensive and decreases demand for the products we produce. The low value of the U.S. dollar in prior years has helped to maintain strong almond prices in overseas markets, but we are now seeing this change as the U.S. dollar has strengthened against the Euro and Chinese Yuan in 2018 and the beginning of 2019. The full potential impact of an increasing U.S. dollar to our pricing and revenue is not known at this time. Additionally, increased tariffs from China and India which are major customers of almonds and pistachios, can make American products less competitive and push customers to switch to another producing country. In 2018, prices for almonds and pistachios have seen some decline due to the uncertainly surrounding trade tariffs.

Weather conditions could impact the number of tree and vine dormant hours, which are integral to tree and vine growth. We will not know the impact of current weather conditions on 2019 production until the early summer of 2019. Thus far, we have experienced heavier rain fall and colder temperatures during the 2018-2019 winter when compared to the 2017-2018 winter, which could positively impact 2019 production.
At this time the State Department of Water Resources has announced that the estimated water supply for 2019 will be at 35% of full entitlement. This allocation is expected to change based upon winter storms. The current 35% allocation of SWP water alone is not enough for us to farm our crops, but our additional water resources, such as groundwater and surface sources, and those of the water districts we are in, should allow us to have sufficient water for our farming needs. It is too early in the year to determine the impact of the 2019 water supplies and its impact on 2019 California crop production for almonds, pistachios, and wine grapes. See discussion of water contract entitlement and long-term outlook for water supply under Item 2, “Properties.” Also see Note 6. (Long-Term Water Assets) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our water assets. 
Ranch Operations
Ranch operations consist of game management revenues and ancillary land uses such as grazing leases and filming. Within game management, we operate our High Desert Hunt Club, a premier upland bird hunting club. The High Desert Hunt Club offers over 6,400 acres and 35 hunting fields, each field providing different terrain and challenges. The hunting season runs from mid-October through March. We sell individual hunting packages as well as memberships.
Approximately 256,000 acres are used for two grazing leases, which account for 41% of total revenues from ranch operations at December 31, 2018.
Ranch operations also includes Hunt at Tejon, which offers a wide variety of guided big game hunts, including trophy Rocky Mountain elk, deer, turkey and wild pig. We offer guided hunts and memberships for both the Spring and Fall hunting seasons. At December 31, 2018, game management accounts for 37% of the total revenue from ranch operations. 
In addition, the ranch operations segment is in charge of upkeep, maintenance, and security of all 270,000 acres of land.
General Environmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations including laws relating to water, air, solid waste, and hazardous substances. Although we believe that we are in material compliance with these requirements, there can be no assurance that we will not incur costs, penalties, and liabilities, including those relating to claims for damages to property or natural resources, resulting from our operations. Environmental liabilities may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties. We also expect continued legislation and regulatory development in the area of climate change and greenhouse gases. It is unclear as of this date how any such developments will affect our business. Enactment of new environmental laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations, might require expenditures in the future. We historically have not had material environmental liabilities.
Customers
During 2018, our PEF power plant lease accounted for 9% of total revenues. In 2017 and 2016, the PEF power plant lease generated 11% and 8% of our total revenues, respectively. No other customer represents 5% or more of our revenues in 2018 and 2017.
Organization
Tejon Ranch Co. is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1987 to succeed the business operated as a California corporation since 1936.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had 122 full-time employees. We believe that we have good relations with our employees. We have adopted a Compliance with State and Federal Statutes, Rules and Regulations Reporting Policy that applies to all of our employees. Its receipt and review by each employee is documented and verified quarterly. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
