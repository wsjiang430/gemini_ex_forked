Sales Cycle
 
 We sell service solutions to government and business enterprises. Our ability to successfully sell our services depends upon the relationships we build and maintain with key decisions makers at existing customers and prospective customer organizations. Our sales cycle is long and is often affected by many factors outside of our control including but not limited to customer specific proposal and acquisition processes, unique customer service requirements, the customer’s timetable and urgency, changes in key leadership and/or personnel that slows down the proposal or project, an evaluation by different functional groups within the prospective customers organization before a purchase decision is made by the organization, budgetary funding delays, intermittent U.S. federal government shutdowns, competitive bidding processes and other policy constraints, as well as additional factors that may lengthen the sales cycle. Many of these variables are outside our control and we attempt to manage the financial impact on us by building a large pipeline with opportunities that have overlapping sales cycles.

 It could take more than 12 months to enter into a contract with a customer from the time we first actively engage a prospective customer and then a full implementation could range from mere weeks to several months depending on the complexity of the customers statement of work and level of engagement by us and the customer to get the deployment completed. Contract closing and implementation timelines vary as a result of these factors, many of which are outside our control.
 
Sales Approaches
 
 We approach selling our services under either a direct sales model under which we control the contract and key relationships or we partner with a large systems integrator subcontractor to provide our TM2 solution as part of their overall total solution offering to the end customer. We have historically grown our business under the direct sales model; however, during fiscal 2018 we closed a significant portion of our new sales through our partnerships with large systems integrators. While we believe we can continue to be successful growing our sales through both models, larger scale opportunities likely exist when we partner with large systems integrators.
 
 Our sales approaches are summarized below:
 
 Systems Integrators. We partner with large systems integrators to collectively pursue and win large market opportunities that include our TM2 solution within the scope of the solicitations. In these types of arrangements, we generally operate as a subcontractor and manage the customer relationship closely with the prime contractor. We do not utilize any channel partners or third-party firms in this sales approach.
 
 Internal Sales Force. We have a team of sales professionals account managers and project managers that are responsible for identifying and pursuing commercial and government opportunities for our TM2 offerings. We take a team approach for engaging with a potential customer. Our sales teams consists of sales lead, account managers, solution experts and other subject matter experts to assist with execution of product demonstrations, proposal creation and submission, contract negotiation, relationship management, sales closing and final transition of closed deals to the operations team. Sales commissions are calculated and paid based on net collected gross managed service revenues times a fixed commission rate that declines over the base term of the contract. There are no commissions paid after the base term expires.
 
 Upselling and Cross Selling. After a customer is on boarded, we focus on delivering our service promise and then upsell and cross sell our TM2 solution offerings. We may enter into preferred supplier network programs agreements with our customers and offer our TM2 solutions on similar terms and conditions to their suppliers and customer which in turn could increase our potential sales opportunities. We also directly ask our customers for referrals into their professional network, customer and supplier groups to drive additional sales opportunities.
 
 Indirect Sales Approach. We may use an indirect sales approach to reach new target markets by outsourcing our lead generation and certain business development activities through a third-party channel partner. We do not use this sales approach very often due to the high cost of commissions charged by these channel partners as their commission terms often span the entire life of the customer relationship which may not be financially viable to the customer or us. We do not anticipate using this sales approach extensively to drive sales opportunities.
 
 Our sales team has a wide variety of skills and expertise to cultivate qualified leads and guide our prospective customers towards finding a solution that meets their organization’s goals and objectives.

Marketing and Branding
 
 Our marketing strategy is to build our brand and increase market awareness of our solutions in our target markets that will allow us to successfully build strong relationships with key decision markers involved in the sales process on the customer side. Key decisions makers typically consist of information technology executives, finance executives and managers of communications assets and networks.
 
 We engage in a wide variety of broad-based and targeted marketing campaigns designed to broaden market awareness of our solutions and expertise. Broad-based marketing campaigns include attending and speaking at industry and tradeshows, website marketing, publishing technical whitepapers and use case studies, topical webcasts, public relations campaigns, subject matter expert forums and industry visibility initiatives. Targeted marketing campaigns including internet search engine optimization, directed e-mail and direct mail, co-marketing strategies designed to leverage existing customer and network relationships.
 
Customer Concentrations
 
 We derive a significant amount of our revenues from contracts funded by federal government agencies for which we act in capacity as the prime contractor, or as a subcontractor. We believe that contracts with federal government agencies in particular, will be the primary source of our revenues for the foreseeable future although we are working to increase our footprint with commercial customers through our relationships with large systems integrators. Accordingly, negative changes in federal government fiscal or spending policies (including continuing budget resolutions and government shutdowns) that impact the spending budgets of our key government customers, including Department of Homeland Security, will directly affect our financial performance.
 
 We expect all of our customers to be motivated to meet their organizational needs for mobile management and security objectives in this challenging mobile environment. As a result of delivering our TM2 service solution we can often save our customers up to 75% of their total spend on mobility and security management which translates into real cash savings. While most of our customers use their savings to purchase and upgrade their managed services our customers could potentially negatively impact our billable revenue base and result in lower profit margins if they decide to retain the savings and not purchase additional higher margin services. We believe we have an attractive set of solutions and we also believe that government spending for cybersecurity services and solutions will increase for the foreseeable future.
  
 Our government customer base is located predominantly in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. while our commercial customer base is located throughout the continental U.S., Canada, Europe and the Middle East. Historically, we have derived, and may continue to derive in the future, a significant percentage of our total revenues from federal government contracts.
  
 Due to the nature of our business and the relative size of certain contracts which are entered into in the ordinary course of business, the loss of any single significant customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In future periods, we will continue to focus on diversifying our revenue by increasing the size and number of customer contracts both in public and private sectors.
  
Government Contracts
 
 We have numerous government contracts and contract vehicles. Our contracts with the federal government, and many contracts with other entities, permit the government customer to modify, curtail or terminate the contract at any time for the convenience of the government, or for default by the contractor. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we are generally reimbursed for our allowable costs through the date of termination and are paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work actually performed.

 Contract vehicles include Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (“GWACs”), and Blanket Purchase Agreements (“BPAs”) based upon GSA Schedule 70, and customer specific contracts. We also hold a number of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (“ID/IQ”) contracts, including, but not limited to:
 
  ■ 
 Department of Homeland Security Blanket Purchase Agreement (DHS BPA) for Cellular Wireless Managed Services.


  ■ 
 Department of Health and Human Services Telecommunications Inventory and Expense Management Solutions contract.


  ■ 
 Subsidiaries of WidePoint are approved subcontractors for the following ID/IQ contracts:

 
  o
Defense Logistics Agency J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS)

  o
GSA Alliant 2

  o
GSA Networx

  o
GSA Connections II

  o
National Institutes of Health Chief Information Officer Solutions and Partners (CIO-SP3)

  o
Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Program Management and Support Services (PMSS)

  o
NASA Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP)

  o
Department of Justice Information Technology Support Services (“ITSS”) 3 contract

 
 We will continue to build on our partnerships with key systems integrators to out compete our competitors for public and private sector opportunities.
  
Product Development and Technology Solution Enhancements
  
 We believe that our existing technology platforms are adequate and meet our operational obligations to our customers. We may fund certain product development initiatives to enhance or customize existing client facing platforms and software solutions. These initiatives are aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our software solutions and meet our customer’s changing organizational requirements, as necessary. We determine which enhancements to further develop after assessing the market capabilities sought by potential customers, considering technological advances, feedback on enhancements from our current customer user groups and other factors. Our current development activities are focused on the integration of our heterogeneous services delivery platforms, and improving the security posture and delivery of our information technology services.
  
 We utilize a standard architecture to ensure enhancements are subject to appropriate oversight and scrutiny and follow a consistent and efficient process. Our development team is comprised of professionals with hands-on technical and practical customer-side development experience. We believe this allows us to design and deploy enhancements that can resolve real-world problems in a timely manner.

 We funded and expensed strategic product development initiatives as well as platform and portal integrations and other product and portal enhancements totaling approximately $229,000 in 2018, which was capitalized and $579,800, of which $360,700 was capitalized in 2017. In 2019, we will continue to work with our strategic partners to continue and focus our product development efforts as well as with customer integrations.
  
Data Centers
  
 We host our proprietary solutions and operate all servers, systems and networks at five (5) data centers located in Ireland, Ohio, and Virginia, which we may consolidate in the future. Our agreements with our customers contain guarantees regarding specified levels of system availability, and we regularly provide our customers with performance reports against those standards. We utilize monitoring technology software tools that continuously checks our servers and key underlying components at regular intervals for issues with system availability and performance, server and application security and penetration vulnerabilities, and other factors that may impact the availability of our systems to our customers. Each data center provides security measures, redundant environmental controls, fire suppression systems and redundant electrical generators to meet our service level agreements. To facilitate data loss recovery, we operate a multi-tiered system configuration with load-balanced web server pools, replicated database servers and fault-tolerant storage devices. The architecture is designed to ensure near real-time data recovery in the event of a malfunction of a primary server. Based on customer requirements, we can also provide near real-time asynchronous data replication between operational and disaster recovery backup sites.
Intellectual Property
 
 Our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and other rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary service as a solution, technology, operational processes and other intellectual property. We protect our intellectual property rights in a number of ways including entering into confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, customers, consultants and partners in an attempt to control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary technology and other information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop software or services with the same functionality as our software and services.
  
 U.S. patent filings are intended to provide the holder with a right to exclude others from making, using, selling or importing in the United States the inventions covered by the claims of granted patents. Our patents, including our pending patents, if granted, may be contested, circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, the rights that may be granted in those issued and pending patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing those patents. Therefore, the exact benefits of our issued patents and, if issued, our pending patents and the other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty.

  Market Competition
  
 Our TM2 market is centered around mobile management and security as shown below:
  

 
 Target Markets. Our target market is highly fragmented and we compete with small and large companies that offer different components of TM2. We believe that we are presently the only provider of all three of these critical services offerings. We believe that our TM2 solution offering gives us a strong competitive advantage over our competitors due to our distinctive technical competencies, successful past contract performance with large commercial and government organizations, governmental certifications and approvals to operate within this space, price and value of services delivered, reputation for quality, and key management personnel with subject matter expertise. 
  
 Market Pricing. Pricing for services in our market lack of transparency due to the way in which our competitors price their services. Our competitors take advantage of this lack of pricing transparency and prospective customer’s lack of understanding and awareness of market pricing for services. Our competitors often take advantage of a prospective customer and will often heavily discount their prices to unprofitable levels thereby creating a commodity pricing environment that affects the value of the solution perceived by prospective customers, severely limits profitability for other service providers that provide better solutions, discourages further innovation and harms the customer in the end.  The costs to switch solutions can be high for a prospective customer even if they know their current solution is not working.
  
 Our pricing for services are transparent and we attempt to match our customers need with the right level of services for a single inclusive fee whenever practical. We practice transparent pricing strategies that allow our customers to purchase our entire full-service solution or select only the services they require to meet their needs. We do not use introductory teaser rates to attract new customers or conduct bait and switch pricing tactics with our customers as is often practiced by our competitors. Pricing for our TM2 offering will vary depending on our prospective customer’s technology infrastructure, scale of their operations, workflow requirements and many other factors that can affect pricing.
  
 We do not view our services as a commodity, and comparability of our TM2 offering against other competitors’ service offerings is not practical due to differences in pricing models described above and overall capabilities among competitors. As a result of this pricing differences between us and our competitors it can be difficult to compare to pricing models in our market.
  
 All prospective customers tend to initially have price sensitivity and that often changes after we are able to demonstrate that our solutions will save them time and money. We believe our TM2 solution pricing is competitive and reflects the value of the solutions provide to our customers. Our goal is providing the best solution for our customers that meets their needs. We may not always be the lowest cost provider and as a result our ability to win new work and charge a reasonable fee for our services entirely depends on the value perceived by our customers.

 Competition. Our TM2 solution crosses into several different market segments and as a result we do not have competitors that compete in all of the market segments in which we conduct business.  The following table outlines what areas of TM2 our competitors provide:
  
 

 
 Our larger competitors often have more size and financial resources than us and they may be able to provide a wider array of technology solutions outside of our core capabilities.  Due to our significant federal government contract concentrations we also experience competition from a variety of both large and small companies, including divisions of large federal government integrators such as Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and other large and mid-sized federal contractors, as well as a limited number of small to mid-sized subject matter expert organizations offering specialized capabilities within the identity management space.
  
 If we are unable to keep pace with the intense competition in our marketplace, deliver cost-effective and relevant solutions to our target market, our business, financial condition and results of operations will suffer.
  
  Contracting
  
 We prefer to serve as the prime contractor when we win contract awards; however, we will often serve as a subcontractor and partner with a large systems integrator to win a larger market opportunity. We also may enter into strategic teaming agreements with another competitor or a vertical supplier to capture a market opportunity. Prospective customers in our target market use a wide array of contract vehicles to purchase technology services ranging from individual purchase orders, awards or consolidated service contracts (including blanket purchase agreements and similar indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts) that cover a range of technology services, of which we may or may not be able to provide all of the services to serve as the prime contractor.
Seasonality
 
 Our business is not seasonal. However, our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, due to revenues earned on contracts, the number of billable days in a quarter, the timing of the pass-through of other direct costs, the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter; as well as the schedule of the government agencies for awarding contracts, the term of each contract that we have been awarded and general economic conditions. Because a significant portion of our expenses, such as personnel and facilities costs, are fixed in the short term, successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter.

Employees
  
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 227 full-time employees (182 in the U.S. and 45 in Europe). We periodically engage additional consultants and employ temporary employees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
