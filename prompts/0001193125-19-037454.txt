General 
 Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. provides contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe with a fleet of 17 offshore drilling rigs, consisting of four drillships and 13 semisubmersible rigs. Three of these rigs are currently cold stacked. We are currently reactivating and preparing for future contracts for the Ocean Endeavor and Ocean Onyx, both of which were cold stacked in 2016. See  Our Fleet  Fleet Status and  Our Fleet  Fleet Enhancements and Additions. 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to Diamond Offshore, we, us or our mean Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1989. 
 Our Fleet 
 Our fleet enables us to offer services in the floater market on a worldwide basis. A floater rig is a type of mobile offshore drilling rig that floats and does not rest on the seafloor. This asset class includes self-propelled drillships and semisubmersible rigs. 
 Semisubmersible rigs are comprised of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected to lower hull members. Such rigs operate in a semi-submerged position, remaining afloat, off bottom, in a position in which the lower hull is approximately 55 feet to 90 feet below the water line and the upper deck protrudes well above the surface. Semisubmersibles hold position while drilling by use of a series of small propulsion units or thrusters that provide dynamic positioning, or DP, to keep the rig on location, or with anchors tethered to the sea bed. Although DP semisubmersibles are self-propelled, such rigs may be moved long distances with the assistance of tug boats. Non-DP, or moored, semisubmersibles require tug boats or the use of a heavy lift vessel to move between locations. 
 A drillship is an adaptation of a maritime vessel that is designed and constructed to carry out drilling operations by means of a substructure with a moon pool centrally located in the hull. Drillships are typically self-propelled and are positioned over a drillsite through the use of a DP system similar to those used on semisubmersible rigs.

(a) | Rated water depth for drillships and semisubmersibles reflects the maximum water depth in which a floating rig has been designed for drilling operations. However, individual rigs are capable of drilling, or have drilled, in marginally greater water depths depending on various conditions (such as salinity of the ocean, weather and sea conditions).
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | Represents year rig was built and originally placed in service or year rig was redelivered with significant enhancements that enabled the rig to be classified within a different floater category than originally constructed.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | GOM means U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
----+-------------------------------


(d) | For ease of presentation in this table, customer names have been shortened or abbreviated. Warm-stacked is used to describe a rig that is idled (not contracted) and maintained in a ready state with a full crew to enable the rig to be quickly placed into service when contracted. Cold-stacked is used to describe an idled rig for which steps have been taken to preserve the rig and reduce certain costs, such as crew costs and maintenance expenses. Depending on the amount of time that a rig is cold-stacked, significant expenditures may be required to return the rig to a ready state.

 Fleet Enhancements and Additions. 
 Our long-term strategy is to upgrade our fleet to meet customer demand for advanced, efficient and high-tech rigs by acquiring or building new rigs when possible to do so at attractive prices. Our most recent fleet enhancement cycle was completed in 2016, with the delivery of the Ocean GreatWhite. During 2018, we began reactivation of the Ocean Endeavor. The rig is currently in the U.K., where it is completing its reactivation and is undergoing contract preparation activities in advance of its upcoming contract in the second quarter of 2019. In addition, in late 2018, we initiated the reactivation and upgrade of the Ocean Onyx to increase the rigs marketability by expanding its lower deck load, reducing rig motion response and making other technologically desirable enhancements sought by our customers. The Ocean Onyx has been moved to Singapore, where we expect its upgrade to be completed in the later part of 2019. 
 We continue to evaluate further rig acquisition and enhancement opportunities as they arise. However, we can provide no assurance whether, or to what extent, we will continue to make rig acquisitions or enhancements to our fleet. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Sources and Uses of Cash  Rig Reactivation, Upgrade and Other Capital Expenditures in Item 7 of this report.

 Offshore Contract Drilling Services 
 Our contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms and provisions. We typically obtain our contracts through a competitive bid process, although it is not unusual for us to be awarded drilling contracts following direct negotiations. Our drilling contracts generally provide for a basic dayrate regardless of whether or not drilling results in a productive well. Drilling contracts generally also provide for reductions in rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other circumstances. Under dayrate contracts, we generally pay the operating expenses of the rig, including wages and the cost of incidental supplies. Historically, dayrate contracts have accounted for the majority of our revenues. In addition, from time to time, our dayrate contracts may also provide for the ability to earn an incentive bonus from our customer based upon performance. 
 The duration of a dayrate drilling contract is generally tied to the time required to drill a single well or a group of wells, in what we refer to as a well-to-well contract, or a fixed period of time, in what we refer to as a term contract. Our drilling contracts may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling unit is destroyed or lost, or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or, in some cases, due to events beyond the control of either party to the contract. Certain of our contracts also permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice; in most circumstances this requires the payment of an early termination fee by the customer. The contract term in many instances may also 
 
5 


  be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time, generally subject to mutually agreeable terms and rates at the time of the extension. In periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs, drilling contractors may prefer longer term contracts to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, while customers may prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the benefit of declining dayrates. Moreover, drilling contractors may accept lower dayrates in a declining market in order to obtain longer-term contracts and add backlog. See Risk Factors  We may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts for our rigs and Risk Factors  Our business involves numerous operating hazards that could expose us to significant losses and significant damage claims. We are not fully insured against all of these risks and our contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect us, in Item 1A of this report, which are incorporated herein by reference. For a discussion of our contract backlog, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Contract Drilling Backlog in Item 7 of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Customers 
 We provide offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we performed services for 13, 14 and 18 different customers, respectively. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, our most significant customers were as follows: 

 | Percentage of AnnualConsolidated Revenues | 
Customer | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
Anadarko | | 33.8 | % | | 24.9 | % | 22.4 | %
Hess Corporation | | 25.0 | % | | 16.0 | % | 7.7 | %
Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. | | 15.8 | % | | 18.9 | % | 17.9 | %
BP | | 10.5 | % | | 15.8 | % | 9.0 | %

 No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our annual total consolidated revenues during 2018, 2017 or 2016. See Risk Factors  Our industry is highly competitive, with oversupply of drilling rigs and intense price competition and Risk Factors  Our customer base is concentrated in Item 1A of this report, which are incorporated herein by reference. 
 As of January 1, 2019, our contract backlog was $2.0 billion attributable to 12 customers. All four of our drillships are currently contracted to work in the GOM. As of January 1, 2019, contract backlog attributable to our expected operations in the GOM was $471.0 million, $372.0 million, $217.0 million and $36.0 million for the years 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, all of which was attributable to three customers. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Contract Drilling Backlog in Item 7 of this report. See Risk Factors  We can provide no assurance that our drilling contracts will not be terminated early or that our current backlog of contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized in Item 1A of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Competition 
 Based on industry data, as of the date of this report, there are approximately 760 mobile drilling rigs (drillships, semi-submersibles and jack-up rigs) in service worldwide, including approximately 240 floater rigs. Despite consolidation in previous years, the offshore contract drilling industry remains highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. Some of our competitors may have greater financial or other resources than we do. 
 Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Customers may also consider rig availability and location, a drilling contractors operational and safety performance record, and condition and suitability of equipment. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors.

 We compete on a worldwide basis, but competition may vary significantly by region at any particular time. See Markets. Competition for offshore rigs generally takes place on a global basis, as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved, although at a cost that may be substantial, from one region to another. It is characteristic of the offshore drilling industry to move rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher dayrates. The current oversupply of offshore drilling rigs also intensifies price competition. See Risk Factors  Our industry is highly competitive, with oversupply of drilling rigs and intense price competition in Item 1A of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Governmental Regulation 
 Our operations are subject to numerous international, foreign, U.S., state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to our operations, including regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and clean-up under some circumstances, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, and may include laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use. See Risk Factors  We are subject to extensive domestic and international laws and regulations that could significantly limit our business activities and revenues and increase our costs and Risk Factors  Regulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business in Item 1A of this report, which are incorporated herein by reference. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,300 workers, including international crew personnel furnished through independent labor contractors.
