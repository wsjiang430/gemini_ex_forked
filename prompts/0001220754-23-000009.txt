Item 1. Business.
Overview
ModivCare Inc. ("ModivCare" or the "Company") is a technology-enabled healthcare services company that provides a suite of integrated supportive care solutions for payors and their members. Its value-based solutions address the social determinants of health, or SDoH, connect members to care, help health plans manage risks, reduce costs, and improve health outcomes. ModivCare is a provider of non-emergency medical transportation, or NEMT, personal care, and remote patient monitoring, or RPM, solutions, which serve similar, highly vulnerable patient populations. The technology-enabled operating model includes NEMT core competencies in risk underwriting, contact center management, network credentialing, claims management and non-emergency medical transportation management. Additionally, its personal care services include placements of non-medical personal care assistants, home health aides and nurses primarily to Medicaid patient populations in need of care monitoring and assistance performing daily living activities in the home setting, including senior citizens and disabled adults. ModivCare’s remote patient monitoring services include personal emergency response systems, vitals monitoring and data-driven patient engagement solutions. ModivCare is further expanding its offerings to include meal delivery and working with communities to provide meals to food-insecure individuals.
ModivCare also holds a 43.6% minority interest in CCHN Group Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, which operates under the Matrix Medical Network brand (“Matrix”). Matrix, which is included in our Corporate and Other segment, maintains a national network of community-based clinicians who deliver in-home and on-site services, and a fleet of mobile health clinics that provide community-based care with advanced diagnostic capabilities and enhanced care options.

Our Strategies 
ModivCare has grown from a stand-alone NEMT provider to a company with a comprehensive supportive care platform focused on SDoH. Our services include NEMT, personal care and remote patient monitoring. Throughout this phase of growth, our strategy has evolved toward a vision of One ModivCare. This strategy emphasizes our focus on alignment across all of our supportive care services that will help us align best practices, drive scale and efficiencies, and standardize processes to ensure the best experience for our members and customers. ModivCare is focused on aligning our people, processes, and technology for each business segment while integrating data across our point solutions to better serve our members.
ModivCare is focused on execution, growth, and results. To highlight a couple of strategic initiatives in our business segments:
•NEMT – our partnership model is focused on narrowing our network of transportation providers to ensure we provide our partners with a guaranteed number of trips in exchange for high quality service and on-time performance. Our multi-modal strategy ensures that members receive the most appropriate ride, whether it is a standard sedan, ride-share, public transit, or a family member receiving mileage reimbursement. Our focus is to make sure our members have the best transportation experience tailored to each of our members' individualized transportation needs.
•Personal Care – our team is focused on integrating, centralizing, and standardizing non-clinical functions and certain operational processes into repeatable processes across our network of personal care offices. This strategy will empower and enable caregivers to focus on providing high quality services to members and leverage their time to improve recruiting and retention efforts. Another aspect of our workforce development is capturing feedback through our caregiver advisory council, as well as providing a multi-benefit menu, which includes same-day pay, enhanced healthcare benefits, and cell phone assistance, to further enhance retention.
•Remote Patient Monitoring – our monitoring team is focused on gaining market share through enhanced selling initiatives and leveraging our long-standing relationships with payors to have enterprise-wide discussions at the highest level. We will continue to innovate and invest in technology to maintain our industry leading position in remote patient monitoring. 
Technology Enhancements 
Transportation related to care is one of the most impactful experiences contributing to our members’ satisfaction during their care encounter. At the core of our operational and technological strategies is a focus on driving member satisfaction. Our Advanced Transportation Management System (ATMS) software continues to enhance our member experience by providing real-time visibility into trip status, optimized routing, and automated billing and trip assignments. Our technology platform and continued enhancements reduce inbound calls from members looking for assistance on the location of the transportation provider, improve on-time percentages, enhance member satisfaction, and reduce costs while increasing efficiency. Specifically, our platform and continuous technology improvements provide opportunities for revenue growth and reduced costs as well as the following additional benefits:
•member communications through texting, email and automated calls, including the ability for the member to see the location of the transportation provider in real time on a mobile device;
•optimized routing from industry-leading ATMS software;
•automated trip assignments allowing for proactive management for rejected, canceled and late rides;
•automated billing allowing for more precise and timely mileage logs and service outcomes; and
•driver application enhancements for transportation providers. 
With respect to our Personal Care segment, process improvements, augmented by technology, are expected to help reduce costs while maintaining quality and compliant patient care. In addition, we strive to become the employer of choice in each of our Personal Care segment markets. Our scale and density in these markets allow us to provide the number of weekly work hours our caregivers desire, which gives us a competitive advantage in recruitment and retention of caregivers that might otherwise need to work for several agencies to obtain the desired number of work hours. With respect to the RPM segment, the suite of technology-enabled in-home solutions provides improved patient outcomes with peace-of-mind support and reduced costs to payers which drives value and deepens our engagement with members. Greater access to real time information, enabled through our technology, provides us the ability to shorten cycle times to help identify and resolve client and member issues. 
Organic Growth 
•NEMT Segment. Across the healthcare market, we see an increasing understanding of the benefit of removing transportation as a barrier to care and a way to improve other determinants of health, such as access to food, shelter, socialization, and pharmacy. We believe that our scale, deep experience, operational strategy, and technology tools 
uniquely position us to address member needs related to access to transportation for vulnerable populations. We approach sales, marketing and business development in a manner that is focused on driving market share in our core Medicaid market, including states and MCOs, Medicare Advantage plans, health systems and providers. Simultaneously, we target business development efforts with partners to enter new transportation markets, including the movement of home health providers, pharmacy delivery and beneficiaries of workers compensation. We expect there will be network effects as we serve more and more healthcare constituencies within a geography.
•Personal Care Segment. We intend to continue to grow in our existing markets for personal care services by: 
◦increasing recruiting and expanding our caregiver workforce; 
◦developing and retaining our caregivers;
◦delivering consistent and reliable quality of care; 
◦leveraging and expanding existing payor and referral source relationships; and 
◦strategic de novo sites to increase density and scale. 
Our business development activities in this area include community outreach in each of our markets, where we educate referral sources about the benefits of personal care services and the programs available to patients. We believe that demographic trends such as an aging population and longer life expectancies will increase the size of our addressable market, and that the demand for in-home personal care will further increase because it is the lowest cost setting and therefore preferred by payors and also by patients, who also tend to prefer their own homes over institutional settings. We also believe that the carve-in of personal care into Medicare Advantage plans provides further opportunity for organic growth. As one of the largest platforms providing in-home personal care, we differentiate our services by providing broad geographic coverage in both urban and rural areas and the capability to offer a broad suite of services and manage complex cases involving high-needs patients. In addition, we are working with MCOs and other payors to lower overall cost of care and improve outcomes by managing risk factors, such as falls, and using technology solutions to provide early indicators of change in condition to avoid hospitalization. With these capabilities, we strive to be the provider of choice for in-home personal care services and intend to continue differentiating our services from the competition and winning market share by relying on strong regional leadership, clinical capabilities, qualified and well-trained caregivers and investment in technology.
•RPM Segment. We see the opportunity for remote patient monitoring services, which include personal emergency response systems, vitals monitoring, medication adherence solutions, and integrated data reporting and analytics, to provide an alternative to costly existing healthcare solutions, which can be obtained in the safety and comfort of our members' homes. We believe that there is a natural untapped market with considerable growth opportunities that we can reach by cross-selling into our existing relationships with Medicaid and Medicare Advantage plans and marketing the reduced cost of providing coverage for remote monitoring solutions while also resulting in improved patient outcomes and enhanced patient engagement and experience. Further, we believe that demographic trends such as the aging population and increasing prevalence of chronic illness increase the addressable market to support patients that demand in-home solutions where they are able to maintain their independence and avoid long-term care facilities, preventable emergency room use, hospitalization, and hospital readmission. Along with the demographic trends, structural changes in the healthcare industry driven by the pandemic have accelerated the shift to virtual healthcare solutions and highlighted the efficiencies and cost effectiveness of providing virtual health solutions. By addressing this sizable market that is expected to increase with the shift in the demographic trends and structural changes in the industry toward value-based solutions, we also see an opportunity to address additional payors in order to provide awareness of the benefits of remote monitoring solutions in order to expand the number of payors that offer coverage for this solution and expand our geographic span as we strive to be the provider of choice for remote patient monitoring services.
Inorganic Growth 
•NEMT Segment. We believe our experience, relationships in the industry, scale and executive team strongly position us to be a consolidator in healthcare transportation. Our acquisition strategy may include an evaluation of new entrants, which may not be able to otherwise compete without the benefits of scale and experience, and closely-held businesses that may seek a new capital structure or sale to achieve liquidity for founders. With our balance sheet, strong team and track record, we believe we are a natural consolidator.
•Personal Care Segment. We believe there is a significant opportunity for continued growth through acquisition in both new and existing personal care services markets. The personal care services industry is highly fragmented, and smaller competitors are finding it increasingly difficult to compete as payors look to narrow their provider networks and contract with providers of scale that can offer a wide breadth of services and capabilities across a broad geographic 
area. Moreover, smaller competitors may not have the capital to invest in technology and lack the market density to attract caregivers. We will continue to explore opportunities to acquire regional providers to enter into new markets, and tuck-in acquisitions to grow our presence in existing markets, as well as to branch out into adjacent businesses.
•RPM Segment. We believe there are opportunities for growth through acquisitions in the remote patient monitoring market. The remote patient monitoring industry is highly fragmented, and we believe that our scale and healthcare-centric platform provide us with the ability to acquire companies in new markets and regions and expand our breadth of operations. Technological innovation is also a critical component of the industry’s growth. We believe that our technology agnostic platform allows us to efficiently acquire companies that offer newer technologies and service offerings that we can leverage to accelerate our existing technology and offerings. We will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the RPM segment to supplement our growth going forward. 
Strategic Capital Allocation
We seek to manage and allocate capital in a way that creates value and supports the execution of our business strategy. The operations of our respective business segments contribute the primary source of capital to the Company supplemented by any issuances by the Company in the capital markets. Our NEMT segment has continued to generate strong revenue growth for the Company. Further, our Personal Care segment has shown consistent revenue growth, a strong free cash flow profile, and maintains an asset-light model. Our RPM segment has also contributed to our continued growth with positive cash flows and strong profit margin. With all of our segments operating collectively, our combined balance sheet provides us with optionality with respect to capital allocation and how we can best deliver stockholder value. We will continue to focus on operational efficiencies by investing in platforms that streamline our operations and seek to enhance our technical capabilities through technological initiatives in an effort to enhance our client and member experience. With respect to our Personal Care segment, we are committed to maintaining and improving the quality of our member care by dedicating appropriate resources at each site and continuing to refine our clinical and non-clinical initiatives and objectives. We are implementing technology enhancements and service protocols intended to promote best practices, enhance the member experience, and improve the operating effectiveness and efficiency of our case management, training, staffing, scheduling and labor management. We will also continue to assess the opportunities for capital deployment in order to create value for stockholders, which may include dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions.
Our Operations
We are a technology-enabled, healthcare services company that is the nation’s largest manager of NEMT programs for state governments and MCOs, a leading in-home personal care services provider in the seven eastern states where we provide those services, and a leading provider of remote patient monitoring and medication management solutions. Our core competencies in NEMT include contact center management, network credentialing, claims management and non-emergency medical transport management. Our in-home personal care services include placements of non-medical personal care assistants, home health aides and skilled nurses primarily to Medicaid patient populations in need of care monitoring and assistance performing daily living activities, including senior citizens and disabled adults. Our RPM services include provision of personal emergency response systems, vitals monitoring, medication management, and data-driven patient engagement solutions. 
By offering our suite of integrated supportive care solutions for our payors and members, we are focused on becoming among the nation’s preeminent SDoH companies and delivering better care in the home, enhancing patient lives, and reducing healthcare costs. We report our operations as described above under four separate business segments: NEMT; Personal Care; RPM; and Corporate and Other, each of which is described below in greater detail following the next subsection captioned “Business Trends”. 
Business Trends
Our performance is affected by a number of trends that drive the demand for our services. In particular, the markets in which we operate are exposed to various trends, such as healthcare industry and demographic dynamics. Over the long term, we believe there are numerous factors that could affect growth within the industries in which we operate, including:
•an aging population, which is expected to increase demand for healthcare services and, as a result, increase the demand for transportation to healthcare sites as well as the demand for in-home personal care services and remote monitoring; 
•a movement towards value-based care and budget pressure on governments, both of which may increase the use of private corporations to provide necessary and innovative services;
•increasing demand for in-home care provision, driven by cost pressures on traditional reimbursement models, and increasing desire for individuals to "age-in-place", and technological advances enabling remote engagement;
•technological advancements, which may be utilized by us to improve services and lower costs, but may also be utilized by others, which may increase industry competitiveness;
•an acceleration in the movement of care from higher-cost acute and post-acute sites to lower-cost non-acute sites including an increased demand for home-based services and virtual care as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; and
•MCO, Medicaid and Medicare plans increasingly are covering NEMT services for a variety of reasons, including increased access to care, improved patient compliance with treatment plans, social trends, and to promote social determinants of health, and this trend may be accelerated or reinforced by the adoption of The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 ("H.R.133"), a component of which mandates that state Medicaid programs ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries have necessary transportation to and from health care providers.
Each year, millions of Medicaid members are estimated to miss out on medical care due to lack of transportation. NEMT solutions enable access to care that not only improves the quality of life and health of the patients receiving services, but also enable many of the individuals to pursue independent living in their homes rather than in more expensive institutional care settings. In addition, studies have shown that missed medical appointments lessen patient compliance with clinical guidelines and lead to increased complications and expensive medical services. Moreover, preventive care has proven to lower the cost of overall care by avoiding potentially more serious, costly emergent services later. NEMT providers also cater to individuals with specialized transportation requirements. 
The U.S. personal care services market also benefits from the strong underlying trends of aging demographics and a shift toward value-based care, which is moving care away from more expensive institutional settings and into the home. Many consumers in this segment need services on a long-term basis to address chronic conditions. Payors establish their own eligibility standards, determine the type, amount, duration and scope of services, and establish the applicable reimbursement rate in accordance with applicable law, regulations or contracts. By providing services in the home to the elderly and others who require long-term care and support with the activities of daily living, personal care service providers lower the cost of treatment by delaying or eliminating the need for care in more expensive settings, such as nursing homes that we believe can cost greater than two times more than equivalent personal care services. In addition, caregivers observe and report changes in the condition of patients for the purpose of facilitating early intervention in the disease process, which often reduces the cost of medical services by preventing unnecessary emergency room visits and/or hospital admissions and re-admissions. By providing care in the preferred setting of the home and by providing opportunities to improve the patient’s conditions and allow early intervention as indicated, personal care also is designed to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction.
Personal care services are a significant component of home and community-based services, which have grown in significance and demand in recent years. Demand for personal care services is expected to continue to grow due to the aging of the U.S. population, increased life expectancy and improved opportunities for individuals to receive home-based care as an alternative to institutional care. The population of those aged 65 years and older nationally has been consistently growing and the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that starting in 2030, when all baby boomers will be older than 65 years, Americans 65 years and older will make up 20.6% of the population, up from 17.3% based on current statistics.
The personal care services industry developed in a highly fragmented manner, with few large participants and many small ones. Few companies have a significant market share across multiple regions or states. We expect ongoing consolidation within the industry, driven by the desire of payors to narrow their networks of service providers, and as a result of the industry’s increasingly complex regulatory, operating and technology requirements. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on a consolidating industry given our reputation in the market, strong payor relationships and integration of technology into our business model.
Similar to personal care services, remote patient monitoring services support the shift toward value-based care as they provide patient self-management and care management operations which support and enable seniors, the chronically ill, and persons with disabilities to maintain their independence and avoid long-term care facilities, preventable emergency room use, hospitalization, and hospital readmission. With the increasing population of Americans 65 and older and the significant increase in the occurrence of chronic diseases, for which elderly patients are more prone to contracting, demand for at-home care solutions in lieu of costly doctor visits and institutional care will continue to grow. This is further driven by structural changes that have occurred in the healthcare industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic toward virtual healthcare solutions. As remote patient monitoring has continued to grow in popularity, this has supported the underlying trend showing increased desire of seniors and individuals to "age-in-place" while also receiving a comparable standard of care. 
Remote patient monitoring also provides the ability to leverage the data analytics obtained in order to produce actionable insights to drive proactive patient interventions which is especially valuable given the growing occurrence of chronic illness. Currently, 60.0% of adults in the U.S. have one reported chronic health condition with 40.0% of adults in the U.S. reporting two or more. Chronic disease is a disease that is persistent or long-lasting and includes heart disease, cancer, and diabetes which are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. These conditions require ongoing and active management and the use of RPM can work to manage symptoms and keep costs for individuals lower in the long-term. RPM 
services allow patients to monitor symptoms from home which decreases the strain on hospitals that have capacity constraints and ensures continued care and interaction with patients. This tech-enabled healthcare solution is covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and many private insurers that set eligibility criteria and establish reimbursement rates in accordance with applicable law, regulations or contracts and has gained significant traction during the COVID-19 pandemic where patients and providers were able to experience the value of remote health solutions while increasing patient experience and retention. This solution has many facets and we believe we are well positioned as the preeminent leader in providing solutions to address the social determinants of health that will work in tandem to increase payor and member value across our holistic suite of solutions.
NEMT Segment
We provide NEMT solutions to our members after obtaining contracts with our clients, including state governments, MCOs and health systems, in 50 states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 34.8 million eligible members received our transportation services, and in 2022, we managed approximately 54.7 million gross trips. 
We primarily contract with state Medicaid programs and MCOs, including Medicare Advantage plans, for the coordination of their members’, who are our “end-users”, NEMT needs. Our end-users are typically Medicaid or Medicare eligible members, whose limited mobility or financial resources hinder their ability to access necessary healthcare and social services. We believe our transportation services enable access to care, as well as access to meals, shelter, socialization, and pharmacy, that not only improve the quality of life and health of the populations we serve, but also enables many of the individuals we serve to pursue independent living in their homes rather than in more expensive institutional care settings. We provide access to NEMT on a more cost-effective basis than self-administered state Medicaid or MCO transportation programs while improving the lives and health outcomes of the populations we serve. 
To fulfill the transportation needs of our end-users, we apply our proprietary technology platform to an extensive network of approximately 5,500 transportation resources. This includes our in-network roster of fully contracted third-party transportation providers who operate sedans, wheelchair equipped vehicles, multi-passenger vans and ambulances. Our system also utilizes relationships with on-demand transportation network companies, mass transit entities, mileage reimbursement programs, taxis and county-based emergency medical service providers. To promote safety, quality and compliance, our in‑network transportation providers undergo an in-depth credentialing and education process.
Our transportation management services also include fraud, waste, and abuse prevention and identification through utilization review programs designed to monitor that our transportation services are provided in compliance with Medicaid and Medicare program rules and regulations as well as to remediate issues that are identified. Compliance controls include ongoing monitoring, auditing and remediation efforts, such as validating end-user eligibility for the requested date of service and employing a series of gatekeeping questions to verify that the treatment type is covered and the appropriate mode of transportation is assigned. We also conduct post-trip confirmations of attendance directly with the healthcare providers for certain repetitive trips, and we employ field monitors to inspect transportation provider vehicles and to observe transports in real time. Our claims validation process generally limits payment to trips that are properly documented, have been authorized in advance, and are billed at the pre-trip estimated amount. Our claims process is increasingly digital, which provides more protection to member protected health information and reduces the impact on the environment. Transportation providers are able to submit their bills and supporting documentation directly to us through a secured web portal.
Contracts with state Medicaid agencies are typically for three to five years with multiple renewal options. Contracts with MCOs continue until terminated by either party upon reasonable notice in accordance with the terms of the contract and allow for regular price adjustments based upon utilization and transportation cost. As of December 31, 2022, 30.5% of NEMT segment revenue was generated under state Medicaid contracts that are subject to renewal within the next 12 months. While we typically expect to renew these contracts as they approach their term, we may receive notice from customers that they are terminating or not renewing their contracts upon expiration.
The NEMT segment generated 87.8% of its revenue in 2022 under capitated contracts. Under capitated contracts, payors pay a fixed amount per eligible member. We assume the responsibility of meeting the covered healthcare related transportation requirements based on per-member per-month fees for the number of eligible members in the customer’s program. Revenue is recognized based on the population served during the period. Certain capitated contracts have provisions for reconciliations, risk corridors or profit rebates. For contracts with reconciliation provisions, capitation payment is received as a prepayment during the month service is provided. These prepayments are periodically reconciled based on actual cost and/or trip volume and may result in refunds to the customer, or additional payments due from the customer. Contracts with risk corridor or profit rebate provisions allow for profit within a certain corridor and once we reach profit level thresholds or maximums, we discontinue recognizing revenue and instead record a liability within the accrued contract payable account. This liability may be reduced through future increases in trip volume or periodic settlements with the customer. While a profit rebate 
provision could only result in a liability from this profit threshold, a risk corridor provision could potentially result in receivables if the Company does not reach certain profit minimums, which would be recorded in the reconciliation contract receivables account. 
The remaining 12.2% of NEMT segment revenue was generated under other types of fee arrangements, including administrative services only and fee-for-service ("FFS"), under which fees are generated based upon billing rates for specific services or defined membership populations. Revenue under FFS contracts represents revenue earned under non-capitated contracts in which we bill and collect a specified amount for each service that we provide. FFS revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are rendered and is reduced by the estimated impact of contractual allowances.
•Customers. In 2022, contracts with state Medicaid agencies and MCOs represented 100.0% of NEMT segment revenue. The NEMT segment does not derive any of its revenue from private pay or other contracts. The NEMT segment derived approximately 10.9%, 9.7% and 9.5% of its revenue from a single state Medicaid agency for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The next four largest NEMT segment customers by revenue comprised in the aggregate approximately 19.8%, 17.7% and 21.6% of NEMT segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•Development Efforts and New Product Offerings. The delivery of our NEMT program is dependent upon a highly integrated platform of technology and business processes as well as the management of a multifaceted network of third-party transportation providers. Our technology platform is purpose-built for the unique needs of our industry and is highly scalable; capable of supporting substantial growth in our clients’ current and future membership base. In addition, our technology platform efficiently provides a broad interconnectivity among end-users, customers, and our network of transportation providers. We believe this technological capability and our industry experience position us well as a leader in the evolving healthcare industry to introduce valuable population insights. We also believe that it will enable us to deliver to our customers and end-users a single repeatable model that standardizes our offerings and is more customer-centric across each contact center. We provide service offerings and technological features for end-users to improve service levels, lower costs and build the foundation for additional data analytics capabilities. We are continuing to implement a modern, cloud based, interactive, voice responsive automated call distribution and work force management system across all contact centers. Our technology also allows for real time notifications to members on their mobile devices, integration with a wide variety of ATMS and transportation network companies, real time ride tracking, network management and analytics.
•Competition. We compete with a variety of national organizations that provide similar healthcare and social services related to transportation, such as Medical Transportation Management, Southeastrans, and Access2Care, as well as local and regional providers. Most local competitors seek to win contracts for specific counties or small geographic territories, whereas we and other larger competitors seek to win contracts for an entire state or large regional area. We compete based upon a number of factors, including our nationwide network, technical expertise, experience, service capability, service quality, and price.
•Seasonality. Our quarterly operating income and cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in the business, principally due to lower transportation demand during the winter season and higher demand during the summer season.
Personal Care Segment 
We provide in-home personal care services to our customers with agency branches across various states, including in several of the nation’s largest home care markets: New York, New Jersey, Florida, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, West Virginia and Connecticut. We place non-medical personal care assistants, home health aides and skilled nurses primarily to Medicaid patient populations in need of care monitoring and assistance performing daily living activities in the home setting, including persons who are at increased risk of hospitalization or institutionalization, such as the elderly, chronically ill or disabled senior citizens and disabled adults. Our personal care services include bathing, personal hygiene, grooming, oral care, dressing, medication reminders, meal planning, preparation and feeding, housekeeping, transportation services, prescription reminders, and assistance with dressing and ambulation, all of which enable aging-in-place and support overall wellness. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 15,600 trained caregivers throughout all of our branch locations serving, on average, approximately 23,300 patients and providing approximately 26.9 million hours of patient care annually. 
Our Personal Care segment payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, MCOs, commercial insurers and private individuals. The federal, state and local programs under which these organizations operate are subject to legislative, budgetary and other risks that can influence reimbursement rates. MCOs that operate as an extension of our 
government payors are subject to similar economic pressures. Our commercial insurance payor clients are continuously seeking opportunities to control costs.
Most of our personal care services are provided pursuant to agreements with state and local governmental aging services agencies, Medicaid waiver programs, and home and community based long-term living programs. These agreements generally have an initial term of one to two years and may be terminated with 60 days’ notice. They are typically renewed in our experience for one to five-year terms, provided that we have complied with licensing, certification and program standards, and other regulatory requirements.
Reimbursement rates and methods vary by state and type of service, but are typically fee-for-service based on hourly or other unit-of-service bases. MCOs are becoming an increasing portion of our Personal Care segment payor mix as states shift from administering FFS programs to utilizing managed care models.
•Customers. In 2022, contracts with state Medicaid agencies and MCOs represented approximately 94.9% of Personal Care segment revenue, with the remaining revenue derived from private pay and other contracts. The Personal Care segment derived approximately 12.0% and 11.7% of its revenue from a single state Medicaid agency for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The next four largest Personal Care segment customers by revenue comprised in the aggregate approximately 29.6% and 27.8% of segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively
•Development Efforts and New Product Offerings. We do not deploy proprietary technology in our Personal Care segment, but we have invested in the implementation of several enterprise technology solutions including Homecare Software Solutions, LLC, which operates under the HHAeXchange brand and which we refer to as “HHAeXchange”, and Celltrak, among others. These solutions manage compliance, scheduling, electronic visit verification (EVV), caregiver payroll and the revenue cycle. HHAeXchange has been deployed for the majority of our Personal Care segment business, and additional functionality is being implemented, including “Stop & Watch” monitoring of change in patient condition, care plan reporting via EVV, mobile application self‑service and others. The three MCOs in Pennsylvania selected HHAeXchange to collect confirmed homecare visits, create claims to MCOs and provide workflow efficiency tools, enabling interoperability between our Personal Care segment operations and the three Pennsylvania MCOs. Celltrak is deployed in New Jersey for EVV in support of assisting with time card verification. In addition to these technology solutions, we continue to identify new technologies that we can invest in to further unify our Personal Care segment across one streamlined technology platform. Additionally, we have implemented the Relias e-learning solutions in select operations, and we continue to roll out the application throughout the segment. Relias e-learning solutions enables required training to be delivered remotely and helps improve utilization by reducing time lost for training.
•Competition. The personal care services industry in which we operate is highly competitive and fragmented. Providers range from facility-based agencies (e.g., day health centers, live-in facilities, government agencies) to independent home care companies. They can be not-for-profit organizations or for-profit organizations. There are relatively few barriers to entry in some of the home healthcare services markets in which we operate. We believe, however, that we have a favorable competitive position, attributable mainly to:
◦the consistently high quality and targeted services we have provided over the years to our patients; 
◦our ability to serve complex, high-needs patient populations;
◦our scale and density in the markets we serve;
◦our strong relationships with payors and referral sources; and
◦our investments in technology. 
•Seasonality. Our quarterly operating income and cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in the business, principally due to somewhat lower demand for in-home services from caregivers during the summer and periods with major holidays, as patients may spend more time with family and less time alone needing outside care during those periods. Our payroll expense in the Personal Care segment is also generally higher during the earlier quarters of the year prior to employees reaching the applicable thresholds for certain payroll taxes, and during periods with major holidays resulting from holiday pay rates.
Remote Patient Monitoring Segment
We provide remote patient monitoring services to support patient self-management and care management operations that enable seniors, the chronically ill, and persons with disabilities to maintain their independence and avoid long‐term care facilities, preventable emergency room use, hospitalization, and hospital readmission. Services include personal emergency 
response systems, vitals monitoring, medication adherence solutions, and integrated data reporting and analytics. With high-touch engagement, the RPM segment has several million annual person-to-person interactions over a population of approximately 236,000 actively monitored health plan members.
We market our RPM services to national and regional health plans, government funded benefit programs, healthcare provider organizations, and individuals. Our commercial insurance payor clients are continuously seeking opportunities to control costs.
◦Customers. The Company serves approximately 236,000 national and regional health plans, government-funded benefit programs, and healthcare provider organizations members, and individuals across the country. We have a diverse base of customers across multiple end markets including Medicare Advantage, State and Managed Medicaid, and Health Systems or Distributors.
◦Development Efforts and New Product Offerings. Our device-agnostic technology platform allows our RPM segment to rapidly adopt and seamlessly integrate new products as hardware innovation continues across the industry. Currently, the Company is contracted with over 30 manufacturers and integrated across more than 200 devices. The RPM segment continuously evaluates new products, integrating over 10 devices annually and with rapid onboarding, the Company averages only 30 days to integrate a new product or technology and deploy it in the field.
◦Competition. We compete with a variety of RPM solution providers that include both new entrants to the healthcare industry and legacy healthcare providers. Top providers include Medtronic, Philips Healthcare, Dexcom, and Honeywell Life Sciences. Given the rapidly changing technology that supports the health-tech industry, any Company that is able to innovate and provide a more efficient and effective solution could enter the RPM market, however there are significant barriers to entry, including long contracting and licensing timeframes, multiple compliance audits necessitating numerous internal tracking systems and complicated reimbursement processes and rules.
Corporate and Other Segment
Our Corporate and Other segment supports the strategic objectives and continued growth of the ModivCare business and includes the activities related to executive, accounting, finance, internal audit, tax, legal and certain strategic and corporate development functions for each segment. The Corporate and Other segment also includes the operating results of the our non-controlling equity interest in Matrix Medical Network ("Matrix"). Prior to our segment reorganization, we reported our investment in Matrix as a separate operating segment. Based on how our Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") now views the business and relative size of the investment, it was determined that these results are reviewed in conjunction with the other corporate results of the business that are not attributable to one of the three operating segments. Our Corporate and Other segment operations support the Company's vision to operate as "One ModivCare" and align our people, processes, and technology across each business segment in order to better serve our members and have a positive impact on closing certain health gaps and addressing the social determinants of health.
Governmental Regulations
Overview
Our business is subject to numerous U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and agency guidance. These laws significantly affect the way in which we operate various aspects of our business. We must also comply with state and local licensing requirements, state and federal requirements for participation in Medicare and Medicaid, requirements for contracting with Medicare Advantage plans, and contractual requirements imposed upon us by the federal, state and local agencies and third-party commercial insurers that provide payment for our services to patients. Failure to follow the rules and requirements of these programs can significantly affect our ability to be paid for the services we provide and be authorized to provide on an ongoing basis.
The Medicare and Medicaid programs are governed by significant and complex laws. Both Medicare and Medicaid are financed, at least in part, with federal funds. Therefore, any direct or indirect recipients of those funds are subject to federal fraud, waste and abuse laws. In addition, there are federal privacy and data security laws that govern the healthcare industry. State laws primarily pertain to the licensure of certain categories of healthcare professionals and providers and the state’s interest in regulating the quality of healthcare in the state, regardless of the source of payment, but may also include state laws pertaining to fraud, waste and abuse, privacy and data security laws, and the state’s regulation of its Medicaid program. Federal and state regulatory laws that may affect our business, include, but are not limited to the following:
•false and other improper claims or false statements laws pertaining to reimbursement;
•the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and its privacy, security, breach notification and enforcement and code set regulations and guidance, along with evolving state laws protecting patient privacy and requiring notifications of unauthorized access to, or use of, patient medical information;
•civil monetary penalties law;
•anti-kickback laws;
•Section 1877 of the Social Security Act, also known as the “Stark Law”, and other self-referral, financial inducement, fee splitting, and patient brokering laws;
•The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, regulations pertaining to Medicare and Medicaid as well as CMS releases applicable to the operation of Medicare Advantage plans, such as reimbursement rates, risk adjustment and data collection methodologies, adjustments to quality management measurements and other relevant factors; 
•State Medicaid laws, rules and regulations that govern program participation, operations, the provision of care to Medicaid beneficiaries and the reimbursement for such services; and 
•state licensure laws.
A violation of certain of these laws could result in civil and criminal damages and penalties, the refund of monies paid by government or private payors, our exclusion from participation in federal healthcare payor programs, or the loss of our license to conduct some or all of our business within a particular state’s boundaries. While we believe that our programs are in compliance with these laws, failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Federal Law and State Laws 
Federal healthcare laws apply in any case in which we provide an item or service that is reimbursable or provide information to our customers that results in reimbursement by a federal healthcare payor program. The principal federal laws that affect our business include those that prohibit the filing of false or improper claims or other data with federal healthcare payor programs, require confidentiality of patient health information, prohibit unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federal healthcare payor programs and those that prohibit physicians from referring to certain entities if the physician has a financial relationship with that entity.
State healthcare laws apply in any case in which we provide an item or service that is reimbursable or provide information to our customers that results in reimbursement by a state Medicaid program. The principal state Medicaid laws that affect our business include those that prohibit the filing of false or improper claims or other data with state Medicaid programs, prohibit unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable by a state Medicaid program and those that prohibit physicians from referring patients to certain entities if the physician has a financial relationship with that entity. Because we receive Medicaid reimbursement, we are subject to applicable participation conditions including a variety of operational, conflict of interest, and structural obligations. For example, in states that have elected to obtain authority to provide NEMT as a medical service through a broker using the regulatory process permitted by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, or DRA, we are prohibited from contracting with any transportation provider with which we have a financial relationship. In addition to Medicaid laws, many states have health care or professional licensure requirements that potentially apply to parts of our business. 
False and Other Improper Claims
Under the federal False Claims Act and similar state laws, the government may impose civil liability on us if we knowingly submit a false claim to the government or cause another to submit a false claim to the government, or knowingly make a false record or statement intended to get a false claim paid by the government. The False Claims Act defines a claim as a demand for money or property made directly to the government or to a contractor, grantee, or other recipient if the money is to be spent on the government’s behalf or if the government will reimburse the contractor or grantee. Liability can be incurred for submitting (or causing another to submit) false claims with actual knowledge or for submitting false claims with reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance. Liability can also be incurred for knowingly making or using a false record or statement to receive payment from the federal government; for knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government; or for knowingly noncomplying with a law or regulation that is material to the government’s decision to pay Medicare or Medicaid claims. Consequently, a provider need not take an affirmative action to conceal or avoid an obligation to the government, but the mere retention of an overpayment from the government could lead to potential liability under the False Claims Act.
Many states also have similar false claims statutes. In addition, healthcare fraud is a priority of the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS, its program integrity contractors and its Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and state Attorneys General. These agencies have devoted a significant amount of resources to investigating healthcare fraud.
If we are ever found to have violated the False Claims Act, we could be required to make significant payments to the government (including damages and penalties in addition to the return of reimbursements previously collected) and could be excluded from participating in federal healthcare programs or providing services to entities which contract with those programs. Although we monitor our billing practices for compliance with applicable laws, such laws are very complex, and we might not be able to detect all errors or interpret such laws in a manner consistent with a court or an agency’s interpretation. While the criminal statutes generally are reserved for instances evidencing fraudulent intent, the civil and administrative penalty statutes are being applied by the federal government in an increasingly broad range of circumstances. Examples of the types of activities giving rise to liability for filing false claims include billing for services not rendered, misrepresenting services rendered (i.e., miscoding), applications for duplicate reimbursement and providing false information that results in reimbursement or impacts reimbursement amounts. Additionally, the federal government takes the position that a pattern of claiming reimbursement for unnecessary services violates these statutes if the claimant should have known that the services were unnecessary. The federal government also takes the position that claiming reimbursement for services that are substandard is a violation of these statutes if the claimant should have known that the care was substandard. Criminal penalties also are available even in the case of claims filed with private insurers if the federal government shows that the claims constitute mail fraud or wire fraud or violate any of the federal criminal healthcare fraud statutes.
State Medicaid agencies and state Attorneys General also have authority to seek criminal or civil sanctions for fraud and abuse violations. In addition, private insurers may bring actions under state false claim laws. In certain circumstances, federal and state laws authorize private whistleblowers to bring false claim or “qui tam” suits on behalf of the government against providers and reward the whistleblower with a portion of any final recovery. In addition, the federal government has engaged a number of private audit organizations to assist it in tracking and recovering claims for healthcare services that may have been improperly submitted.
Governmental investigations and whistleblower qui tam suits against healthcare companies remain at high levels and have resulted in substantial penalties and fines and exclusions of persons and entities from participating in government healthcare programs. While we believe that our programs are in compliance with these laws, failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Health Information, Privacy and Data Protection Practices
Under HIPAA, DHHS issued rules to define and implement standards for the electronic transactions and code sets for the submission of transactions such as claims, and privacy and security of individually identifiable health information in whatever manner it is maintained.
The Final Rule on Enforcement of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification provisions, including the transaction standards, the security standards and the privacy rule, published by DHHS addresses, among other issues, DHHS’s policies for determining violations and calculating civil monetary penalties, how DHHS will address the statutory limitations on the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and various procedural issues. The rule extends enforcement provisions currently applicable to the healthcare privacy regulations to other HIPAA standards, including security, transactions and the appropriate use of service code sets.
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, extends certain of HIPAA’s obligations to parties providing services to healthcare entities covered by HIPAA known as “business associates,” imposes new notice of privacy breach reporting obligations, extends enforcement powers to state Attorneys General and amends the HIPAA privacy and security laws to strengthen the civil and criminal enforcement of HIPAA. HITECH establishes four categories of violations that reflect increasing levels of culpability, four corresponding tiers of penalty amounts that significantly increase the minimum penalty amount for each violation, and a maximum penalty amount of $1.5 million for all violations of an identical provision. With the additional HIPAA enforcement power under HITECH, the Office for Civil Rights of DHHS and states are increasing their investigations and enforcement of HIPAA compliance. We have taken steps to ensure compliance with HIPAA and are monitoring compliance on an ongoing basis.
Additionally, the HITECH Final Rule imposes various requirements on covered entities and business associates, and expands the definition of “business associates” to cover contractors of business associates. Even when we are not operating as covered entities, we may be deemed to be “business associates” for HIPAA rule purposes of such covered entities. We monitor compliance obligations under HIPAA as modified by HITECH, and implement operational and systems changes, associate training and education, conduct risk assessments and allocate resources as needed. Any noncompliance with HIPAA 
requirements could expose us to criminal and increased civil penalties provided under HITECH and require significant costs in order to comply with its requirements or to remediate potential issues that may arise.
Other state privacy laws may also apply to us, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which came into force in January 2020. The CCPA affords California residents with specified rights relating to the collection and use of their personal information. Violation of the CCPA may lead to monetary fines, and data breaches may give rise in certain circumstances to private rights of action by impacted individuals. While we believe that our practices are in compliance with these laws, failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Federal and State Anti-Kickback Laws
Federal law commonly known as the “Anti-Kickback Statute” prohibits the knowing and willful offer, solicitation, payment or receipt of anything of value (direct or indirect, overt or covert, in cash or in kind) which is intended to induce: 
•the referral of an individual for a service for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal healthcare programs; or 
•the ordering, purchasing, leasing, or arranging for, or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any service or item for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal healthcare programs.
Interpretations of the Anti-Kickback Statute have been very broad and under current law, courts and federal regulatory authorities have stated that the Anti-Kickback Statute is violated if even one purpose (as opposed to the sole or primary purpose) of the arrangement is to induce referrals. Even bona fide investment interests in a healthcare provider may be questioned under the Anti-Kickback Statute if the government concludes that the opportunity to invest was offered as an inducement for referrals.
This act is subject to numerous statutory and regulatory “safe harbors.” Compliance with the requirements of a safe harbor offers defenses against Anti-Kickback Statute allegations. Failure of an arrangement to satisfy all of the requirements of a particular safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement is unlawful. It may mean, however, that such an arrangement will be subject to scrutiny by the regulatory authorities.
Many states, including some where we do business, have adopted anti-kickback laws that are similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state laws are very closely patterned on the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; others, however, are broader and reach reimbursement by private payors. If our activities were deemed to be inconsistent with state anti-kickback or illegal remuneration laws, we could face civil and criminal penalties or be barred from such activities, any of which could harm us.
If our arrangements are found to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or applicable state laws, we, along with our clients, would be subject to civil and criminal penalties. In addition, implicated contracts may not be legally enforceable, which could materially and adversely affect our business. While we believe that our programs are in compliance with these laws, failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Federal and State Self-Referral Prohibitions
We may be subject to federal and state statutes banning payments for referrals of patients and referrals by physicians to healthcare providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship. Section 1877 of the Social Security Act, also known as the “Stark Law”, prohibits physicians from making a “referral” for “designated health services” for Medicare (and in many cases Medicaid) patients from entities or facilities in which such physicians directly or indirectly hold a “financial relationship”.
A financial relationship can take the form of a direct or indirect ownership, investment or compensation arrangement. A referral includes the request by a physician for, or ordering of, or the certifying or recertifying the need for, any designated health services.
Certain services that we provide may be identified as “designated health services” for purposes of the Stark Law. We cannot provide assurance that future regulatory changes will not result in other services they provide becoming subject to the Stark Law’s ownership, investment or compensation prohibitions in the future.
Many states, including some states where we do business, have adopted similar or broader prohibitions against payments that are intended to induce referrals of clients. Moreover, many states where we operate have laws similar to the Stark 
Law prohibiting physician self-referrals. While we believe that our programs are in compliance with these laws, failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Surveys and Audits
Our business is subject to periodic surveys by government authorities or their contractors and our payors to ensure compliance with various requirements. Regulators conducting periodic surveys often provide reports containing statements of deficiencies for alleged failures to comply with various regulatory requirements. In most cases, if a deficiency finding is made by a reviewing agency, we will work with the reviewing agency to agree upon the steps to be taken to bring our program into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In some cases, however, an agency may take a number of adverse actions against a program, including:
•the imposition of fines or penalties or the recoupment of amounts paid;
•temporary suspension of admission of new clients to our program’s service;
•in extreme circumstances, exclusion from participation in Medicaid, Medicare or other programs;
•revocation of our license; or
•contract termination.
While we believe that our programs are in compliance with Medicare, Medicaid and other program certification requirements and state licensure requirements, the rules and regulations governing Medicare, Medicaid participation and state licensure are lengthy and complex. Failure to comply with these laws could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to enter into contracts with other agencies to provide services.
Billing/Claims Reviews and Audits
Agencies and other third-party commercial payors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment medical reviews or other audits of our claims or other audits in conjunction with obligations to comply with the requirements of Medicare or Medicaid. In order to conduct these reviews, payors request documentation from us and then review that documentation to determine compliance with applicable rules and regulations, including the eligibility of clients to receive benefits, the appropriateness of the care provided to those clients, and the documentation of that care. Any determination that we have not complied with applicable rules and regulations could result in adjustment of payments or the incurrence of fines and penalties, or in situations of significant compliance failures review or non-renewal of related contracts.
Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee Splitting
The corporate practice of medicine doctrine prohibits corporations from practicing medicine or employing a physician to provide professional medical services. This doctrine arises from state medical practice acts and is based on a number of public policy concerns, including: 
•allowing corporations to practice medicine or employ physicians will result in the commercialization of the practice of medicine; 
•a corporation’s obligation to its stockholders may not align with a physician’s obligation to the physician’s patients; and 
•employment of a physician by a corporation may interfere with the physician’s independent medical judgment. 
Most states in which Matrix operates and in which we provide personal care services prohibit the corporate practice of medicine. Every state provides an exception for physician ownership of a professional corporation. Many states provide an exception for employment of physicians by certain entities. The scope of these exceptions varies from state to state. Corporate practice of medicine doctrine issues can also overlap with kickback and fee-splitting concerns. Some states use the corporate practice of medicine doctrine to limit the services that a manager can furnish to a physician or medical practice because the state is concerned that a manager might interfere with the physician’s independent medical judgment and/or impose an unacceptable intrusion into the relationship between the physician and the patient.
Among other activities, Matrix currently contracts with and employs nurse practitioners to perform Comprehensive Health Assessments ("CHAs") and our Personal Care segment currently: 
•employs registered nurses and licensed practical nurses to render skilled nursing care directly and to provide overall clinical supervision to patients; and 
•has medical professionals provide guidance to its Quality Improvement Committees. 
We believe that Matrix and our Personal Care segment have structured operations appropriately. Either or both, however, could be alleged or found to be in violation of some or all of these laws. If a state determines that some portion of the business violates these laws, or that a payment induced a physician to refer a patient, it may seek to have an entity discontinue or restructure those portions of operations or subject the entity to increased costs, penalties, fines, certain license requirements or other measures. Any determination that Matrix or we acted improperly in this regard may result in liability. In addition, agreements between Matrix and the particular professional may be considered void and unenforceable.
Professional Licensure and Other Requirements 
Many of Matrix’s employees are subject to federal and state laws and regulations governing the ethics and practice of their professions. For example, mid-level practitioners (e.g., Nurse Practitioners) are subject to state laws requiring physician supervision and state laws governing mid-level scope of practice. As physicians’ use of mid-level practitioners increases, state governing boards are implementing more robust regulations governing mid-levels and their scope of practice under physician supervision. The ability of Matrix to provide mid-level practitioner services may be restricted by the enactment of new state laws governing mid-level scope of practice and by state agency interpretations and enforcement of such existing laws. In addition, services rendered by mid-level practitioners may not be reimbursed by payors at the same rates as payors may reimburse physicians for the same services. Lastly, professionals who are eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid as individual providers must not have been excluded from participation in government programs at any time. The ability of Matrix to provide services depends upon the ability of personnel to meet individual licensure and other requirements and maintain such licensure in good standing.
COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Orders 
Emergency, public health and executive orders, issued, extended, or declared by the U.S. federal and state governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have waived numerous legal requirements while also imposing new legal restrictions. Many public health and executive orders are issued, rescinded or modified with little advance notice. These emergency, public health and executive orders have created significant uncertainty in the legal and operational duties of health care providers. While we believe that our programs are in compliance with emergency, public health and executive orders, failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business. At some point in time, the U.S. federal government will formally end the public health emergency. The end of the public health emergency will likely result in the rescission and modification of a number of regulatory requirements which will likely increase the uncertainty of the legal and operational duties of health care providers. While we are planning for the end of the public health emergency, failure to adjust our operations based upon end of the public health emergency could have a material adverse impact on our business.
CARES Act Provider Relief Fund 
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020 (the "CARES Act"), established the Provider Relief Fund that made relief payments to certain health care providers. The purpose of the Provider Relief Fund was to provide funding to health care providers so they could prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus. Providers who received relief payments are subject to eligibility criteria and specific terms and conditions on the use of relief payments. To receive relief payments, many providers were required to attest to numerous statements regarding accuracy of their application and their compliance with the eligibility criteria and the terms and conditions. Providers’ use of relief payments is limited to health care related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to coronavirus. Providers are required to have documentation that relief payments were used for those purposes. There is limited guidance concerning what the government might consider a health care related expense or lost revenue that was attributable to coronavirus or what type of documentation is adequate.
Simplura and Care Finders have received relief payments from the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund. While we believe that the receipt and use of relief payments was in compliance with Provider Relief Fund requirements, failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Human Capital Management
Attracting, developing and retaining talented people who embrace our culture, execute our strategy, and enable us to compete effectively in our industry is critical to our success. To that end, ensuring that we have the right people in the right seats is one of our six pillars guiding our business strategy.
We believe a critical component of our success is our company culture. Our vision statement, “We drive positive health outcomes by transforming the way we connect to care” is at the core of everything we do. We aim to attract and retain 
great people – representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills – who work together as a cohesive team that embody our values.
Our ability to recruit and retain our employees depends on a number of factors, including providing competitive compensation and benefits, development and career advancement opportunities, and a collegial work environment. We invest in those areas in an effort to ensure that we continue to be the employer of choice for our employees.
Compensation and Benefits
Our benefits are designed to help employees and their families stay healthy, meet their financial goals, protect their income and help them have harmony between their work and personal lives. These benefits include health and wellness, paid time off, employee assistance, competitive pay, broad-based bonus programs, pension and retirement savings plans, career growth opportunities, and a culture of recognition.
Employee Development and Advancement 
We invest significant resources to develop employees with the right capabilities to deliver the growth and innovation needed to support our strategy. We seek to ensure that we are building the organizational capabilities required for success in the years to come. We offer employees and their managers a number of tools to help in their personal and professional development, including career development plans, mentoring programs and in-house learning opportunities, including an in-house continuing education program. We also have a practice of investing in our next generation of leaders and offer employees a number of leadership development programs. We believe in and encourage our employees and managers to maintain a growth mindset, a belief that qualities and talents can be developed through dedication and hard work, and have aligned our performance management programs to support our culture transformation with increased focus on continuous learning and development.
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 20,000 employees, of which approximately 3,100 were dedicated to our NEMT and our Corporate and Other segments, 16,400 were dedicated to our Personal Care segment, and 500 were dedicated to our RPM segment. Approximately 2,700 of our Personal Care segment caregivers were unionized in New York at the end of 2022, and we believe that we have good relationships with all of our employees. 
Demographics and Diversity
Our employees reflect the communities in which we live and work, and the customers we serve, and they possess a broad range of thought and experiences that have helped us achieve our successes to date. A key component of our growth and success is our focus on inclusion and diversity. We believe this commitment allows us to better our understanding of patient and customer needs, and develop technologies and solutions to meet those needs. Although we have made progress in our workforce diversity representation, we continue to seek to improve in this important area. We have established goals to continue improving our hiring, development, and retention of diverse employees and our overall diversity representation, including within our executive management team, in an effort to be a socially responsible community member.
