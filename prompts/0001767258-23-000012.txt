Item 1. Business
Company Overview
Founded in 1997 and incorporated in Nevada in 2003, XPEL has grown from an automotive product design software company to a global provider of after-market automotive products, including automotive surface and paint protection, headlight protection, and automotive window films, as well as a provider of complementary proprietary software. In 2018, we expanded our product offerings to include architectural window film (both commercial and residential) and security film protection for commercial and residential uses, and in 2019 we further expanded our product line to include automotive ceramic coatings. 
XPEL began as a software company designing vehicle patterns used to produce cut-to-fit protective film for the painted surfaces of automobiles. In 2007, we began selling automotive surface and paint protection film products to complement our software business. In 2011, we introduced our ULTIMATE protective film product line which, at the time, was the industry’s first protective film with self-healing properties. The ULTIMATE technology allows the protective film to better absorb the impacts from rocks or other road debris, thereby fully protecting the painted surface of a vehicle. The film is described as “self-healing” due to its ability to return to its original state after damage from surface scratches. The launch of the ULTIMATE product catapulted XPEL into several years of strong revenue growth.
Our over-arching strategic philosophy stems from our view that being closer to the end customer in terms of our channel strategy affords us a better opportunity to efficiently introduce new products and deliver tremendous value which, in turn, drives more revenue growth for the Company. Consistent with this philosophy, we have executed on several strategic initiatives including:
2014
•We began our international expansion by establishing an office in the United Kingdom. 
2015
•We acquired Parasol Canada, a distributor of our products in Canada.
2016
•We opened our XPEL Netherlands office and established our European headquarters
2017
•We continued our international expansion with the acquisition of Protex Canada Corp., or Protex Canada, a leading franchisor of automotive protective film franchises serving Canada, and 
•We opened our XPEL Mexico office.
2018
•We launched our first product offering outside of the automotive industry, a window and security film protection for commercial and residential uses.
•We introduced the next generation of our highly successful ULTIMATE line, ULTIMATE PLUS.
•We acquired Apogee Corporation which led to formation of XPEL Asia based in Taiwan.
2019
•We were approved for the listing of our stock on Nasdaq trading under the symbol “XPEL”.
2020
•We acquired Protex Centre, a wholesale-focused paint protection installation business based in Montreal, Canada.
•We expanded our presence in France with the acquisition of certain assets of France Auto Racing.
•We expanded our architectural window film presence with the acquisition of Houston-based Veloce Innovation, a leading provider of architectural films for use in residential, commercial, marine and industrial settings.
2021
•We expanded our presence into numerous automotive dealerships throughout the United States with the acquisition of PermaPlate Film, LLC, a wholesale-focused automotive window film installation and distribution business based in Salt Lake City, Utah.
•We acquired five businesses in the United States and Canada from two sellers as a continuation of our acquisition strategy. These acquisitions allowed us to continue to increase our penetration into mid-range dealerships in the US and solidify our presence in Western Canada.
•We acquired invisiFRAME, Ltd, a designer and manufacturer of paint protection film patterns for bicycles, thus further expanding our non-automotive offerings.
2022
•We expanded our presence in Australia with the purchase of the paint protection film business of our Australian distributor. 
Products and Services
Surface and Paint Protection Film Rolls: Our primary products are paint and surface protection films. Most of the products sold are for automotive application which principally protect painted surfaces from rock chips, damage from bug acids and other road debris. Some of the products sold are used for non-automotive applications, such as industrial protection, screen protection or architectural protection. We sell a variety of product lines each with their own unique characteristics, warranty and intended use.
Automotive Surface and Paint Protection
XPEL ULTIMATE PLUS: ULTIMATE PLUS is our flagship clear, thermoplastic polyurethane, or TPU, based product which is a self-healing, stain-resistant film with exceptional clarity and durability. 
XPEL ULTIMATE FUSION: ULTIMATE FUSION is our newest paint protection film product providing the same benefits as ULTIMATE PLUS but also contains a hydrophobic top-coat which creates a naturally slick surface to repel water and road grime
XPEL STEALTH: STEALTH is a satin-finished paint protection film, made with the same construction as ULTIMATE PLUS. STEALTH is designed to protect surfaces that already have a matte finish or to give otherwise glossy surfaces a matte finish.
TRACWRAP: TRACWRAP is a temporary TPU-based paint protection film, for both do-it-yourself, or DIY, and professional applications, that is designed to be used for a short period of time, including during road trips, vehicle transport or vehicles pending a full installation of our other products such as XPEL ULTIMATE PLUS.
LUX PLUS: LUX PLUS is our flagship clear, TPU-based paint protection film for the Chinese market. Designed and formulated specifically for the demands of China, with excellent self-healing and stain-resistance, it is offered for sale exclusively in that market.
XPEL RX: RX Protection Film provides protection for a variety of surfaces including screens and other electronics and contains silver ions which inhibit the growth of microbes on the film’s surface. 
XPEL ARMOR: ARMOR is a thick PVC-based protection film that looks and performs like a spray-on bedliner. It is designed to resist abrasions and punctures from aggressive terrains. 
OTHER FILMS: We sell a variety of other specialty films in smaller quantities for select customers or in certain markets, including: LUX-M, MPD and ARES in the Chinese Market and F Series Film in various international markets.
Most of our Surface and Paint Protection films are applied wet and can be installed in bulk or pre-cut using our pattern database accessible by DAP, our SAAS platform. While we sell some pre-cut and Do-It-Yourself products made from these rolls directly to consumers, the vast majority of the products are professionally installed.
Surface and Paint Protection film sales represented approximately 62% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Automotive Window Film Rolls: We sell several lines of automotive window films, primarily under the XPEL PRIME brand name, which exhibit a range of performance characteristics and appearances, including:
XPEL PRIME XR PLUS: PRIME XR PLUS offers 98% infrared heat rejection developed with multi-layer nano-particle technology. This is our most expensive flagship product with our best specifications and characteristics. It is available in a variety of visible light transmission, or VLT, levels.
XPEL PRIME XR: PRIME XR utilizes a nano-ceramic construction, blocking 88% of infrared heat and does not interfere with radio, cellular or Bluetooth signals like a metallized film.
XPEL PRIME CS: PRIME CS blocks solar heat radiation to keep vehicles at comfortable temperatures and blocks 99% of harmful UV rays. Available in both a black and neutral charcoal color, PRIME CS is designed to remain the same over the years and never fades or turns purple.
OTHER FILMS: We also sell a variety of other automotive window films both under the PRIME brand and on a private-label basis, including: PRIME X-SERIES and PRIME AP in China, PRIME HP, PRIME GL, PRIME SD and more. Generally, these products are lower cost and are sold only in certain markets.
Automotive window film sales represented approximately 15% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Architectural Window Film Rolls: We sell architectural glass solutions for commercial and residential buildings under the VISION brand name, representing our first product set with a fully non-automotive use. Architectural window films come in several broad categories, including:
SOLAR: Solar films are designed to provide solar energy rejection. We offer a variety of films with varying colors, VLTs and price points.
SAFETY & SECURITY: Safety and Security films are clear, thick polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, films to secure glass in the event of a breakage. We offer a variety of thicknesses and offer films with varying adhesive characteristics for different types of installations.
OTHER: In addition to the main categories of SOLAR and SAFETY & SECURITY films, we also offer anti-graffiti, exterior applied and decorative films.
Architectural window film sales represented approximately 2% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
DAP: A key component of our product offering is our DAP platform. DAP is a proprietary SAAS platform and database consisting of over 80,000 vehicle applications used by the Company and its customers to cut automotive protection film into vehicle panel shapes for both paint protection film and window film products.
We commit significant resources to keep the pattern database updated with a goal toward having a pattern for every panel of every vehicle. When new vehicle models are introduced to the market, we strive to create the pattern as soon as possible. Our patterns and software increase installer efficiency and reduce waste.
Our DAP customers pay a monthly access fee to access our proprietary database. Monthly DAP subscriptions represented less than 2% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Installation and Dealership Services: We offer installation services of our various products directly to retail and wholesale customers through our Company-owned installation facilities in their respective markets and through our dealership services business which provides on-site services to automobile dealerships. Our installation services are primarily automotive film installation but have grown to include architectural film installation in certain markets. Installation services (including product and labor revenue) represented approximately 16% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Miscellaneous Products, Tools and Pre-Cut Films: We sell a variety of other miscellaneous product sets which include:
PRE-CUT FILM PRODUCTS: While most of our surface protection films, automotive window films and architectural window films are sold as rolls, we also offer to pre-cut them into vehicle specific shapes (if applicable) or cut them into smaller pieces or shapes to aide in the installation or to increase affordability or efficiency for our customers.
XPEL FUSION PLUS CERAMIC COATING: XPEL FUSION PLUS is a hydrophobic, self-cleaning coating that can be applied to paint and paint protection film, wheels and calipers, plastic and trim, upholstery and glass. XPEL FUSION PLUS provides additional protection to these surfaces to enhance their appearance and protect from minor scratches. 
TOOLS AND ACCESSORIES: We sell a variety of tools and accessories which are used in the installation of our products, including squeegees and microfiber towels, application fluids, plotter cutters, knives and more. Generally, these are offered as a service to our customers to provide one-stop shopping.
MERCHANDISE AND APPAREL: We sell a variety of XPEL-branded merchandise and apparel which helps represent and build our brand.
Strategic Overview
XPEL continues to pursue several key strategic initiatives to drive continued growth. Our global expansion strategy includes establishing a local presence where possible, allowing us to better control the delivery of our products and services. We also add locally based regional sales personnel, leveraging local knowledge and relationships to expand the markets in which we operate.
We seek to increase global brand awareness in strategically important areas, including pursuing high visibility at premium events such as major car shows and high value placement in advertising media consumed by car enthusiasts, to help further expand the Company’s premium brand. 
XPEL also continues to expand its delivery channels by acquiring select installation facilities in key markets and acquiring international partners to enhance our global reach. As we expand globally, we strive to tailor our distribution model to adapt to target markets. We believe this flexibility allows us to penetrate and grow market share more efficiently. Our acquisition strategy centers on our belief that the closer the Company is to its end customers, the greater its ability to drive increased product sales. During 2022, we acquired the paint protection film business of our Australian distributor in furtherance of this objective. 
We also continue to drive expansion of our non-automotive product portfolio. Our architectural window film segment continues to gain traction. We believe there are multiple uses for protective films and we continue to explore those adjacent market opportunities. 
Sales and Distribution
We sell and distribute our products through independent installers, new car dealerships, third-party distributors, Company-owned installation centers, Automobile Original Equipment Manufacturers, Protex Canada’s franchisees, and online.
Independent Installers/New Car Dealerships 
We primarily operate by selling a complete turn-key solution directly to independent installers and new car dealerships, which includes XPEL protection films, installation training, access to our proprietary DAP software, marketing support and lead generation. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 65% of the Company’s consolidated revenue was through this channel.
We offer a suite of services to complement our products for our dealers and strive to create value for being an XPEL dealer. We provide access to our proprietary DAP software which, in turn, provides access to pattern libraries that enable cutting our films into specific shapes to aid in their installation. We believe that this software greatly enhances installation efficiency and reduces film waste – a valuable feature to our customers, as their highest cost tends to be labor. Increasingly, DAP is used to manage operations for our dealers, including job management, scheduling and inventory tracking. We also provide marketing and lead generation for our customers by featuring them in our dealer locator on our website. To be considered an Authorized Dealer (and thereby have end customers referred to them), independent installers must employ certified installers and meet other requirements including purchase minimums and more. 
Our products are primarily utilized for new cars. As such, new car dealerships will likely be involved in the ultimate sale of our products and services. New car dealerships have multiple options to sell our products: 1) outsourcing the installation of film to the after-market which is the most common option; 2) developing an in-house program where they hire and train their own employees to install the product; and, 3) utilizing third party labor to install the product in the dealership facility either on a pre-load basis or after the sale. We are agnostic as to who applies our products to new vehicles. We support all of these options for new car dealerships through the sales and support to our after-market customers, training and support to dealerships who want to build an in-house program and through our Dealership Services business which provides third party installation services at dealership locations primarily on a pre-load basis.
XPEL also offers 24/7 customer service for independent installers and new car dealerships where we provide installation, software and training support via our website and telephone technical support services. 
Distributors
In various parts of the world, XPEL operates primarily through third-party distributors under written agreements with the Company to develop a market or a region under our supervision and direction. These distributors may sell to other distributors or customers who ultimately install the product on an end customer’s vehicle. Due to the nature of this channel, product margins are generally less than other channels. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 17% of the Company’s consolidated revenue was through this channel. 
In China, we operate through a sole distributor under a distribution agreement, Shanghai Xing Ting Trading Co., Ltd., which we refer to as the China Distributor. Approximately 10% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, was derived from sales to the China Distributor. 
Through our distribution agreement with the China Distributor entered into on May 31, 2018, the China Distributor has rights to promote, market, distribute, sell and install our products in China. Additionally, we have granted the non-exclusive right to the China Distributor to use our software in connection with customers’ purchases of our products. The China Distributor places orders with us on a prepaid basis at a price set by us, which we may change with 30 days’ notice. Certain of our products have minimum purchase requirements that increase annually.
We have also granted the China Distributor a non-exclusive license to use our brands to promote sales of our products to end-users. The distribution agreement applies to separate product categories, distinguished by their exclusive or non-exclusive relationship with the China Distributor, each for a term of five years, each of which will automatically renew for up to three additional five-year periods unless otherwise terminated by either party with 60 days’ notice.
We consider our relations with the China Distributor to be good, but the loss of our relationship could result in the delay of the distribution and a decrease in marketing of our products in China. For more information, see Risk Factors—We currently rely on one distributor of our products and services in China. The loss of this relationship, or a material disruption in sales by this distributor, could severely harm our business” and “A significant percentage of our revenue is generated from our business in China, a market that is associated with certain risks.”
Company-Owned Installation Centers/Dealership Services 
XPEL operates 13 Company-owned installation centers: seven in the United States, three in Canada and one in the United Kingdom. These locations serve wholesale and retail customers in their respective markets. The Company also provides on-site installation services to automobile dealerships throughout 
the United States and Canada through its dealership services business. This channel represented approximately 15% of the Company’s consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
Some of our Company-owned installation centers are located in geographic areas where we also serve customers in our independent installer/dealership channel, which could be perceived to generate channel conflict. However, we believe these channels have a synergistic relationship with our Company-owned centers supporting independent installers and dealerships by allowing us to implement local marketing, making inventory available locally for fast delivery, offering overflow installation capacity and assisting with training needs. We believe this channel strategy benefits our goal of generating the most revenue possible.
Automobile Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”)
XPEL sells products, including paint protection film, and provides services, including the installation of paint protection film and pre-delivery inspection to various OEMs. These services are provided in-plant at the OEMs’ facilities or in one of our facilities that is typically adjacent to the OEM’s facility. This channel represented approximately 3% of the Company’s consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
Online and Catalog Sales
XPEL offers certain products such as paint protection kits, car wash products, after-care products and installation tools via its website. Revenues from this channel are negligible but we believe that by offering these products on our website, we increase brand awareness. The revenue from this channel represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Competition
The Company principally competes with other manufacturers and distributors of automotive protective film products. While the Company considers itself a product company competing with other product companies, the Company believes its suite of services which accompany the Company’s product offerings including its software, marketing and lead generation to its customers and customer service provide for substantial differentiation from its competitors. Within the market for surface and paint protection film, our principal competitors include Eastman Chemical Company (under the LLumar and Suntek brands) and several other smaller companies. For more information, see Risk Factors—The after-market automotive product supply business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our Company.
Suppliers
The Company’s products are sourced from a number of suppliers or manufactured by various third-party contract manufacturers. The Company has currently opted to pursue an “asset-light” manufacturing model whereby third-party suppliers and manufacturers are used to supply the Company with the majority of its products. We routinely evaluate building or buying manufacturing assets for some of our products, but we believe that our asset-light model best suits the Company at the present time. The Company’s film products (including paint protection film and automotive and architectural window films) are produced using various roll-to-roll manufacturing processes performed entirely by third parties. The Company internalizes many conversion operations including quality assurance, inspection, rewinding, boxing and packaging for many of its products at its facilities around the world. 
The Company’s product lines continue to grow and include both film and non-film products. The products fall into three categories: 
•Products where we own or license the intellectual property or, “IP” – the Company owns or licenses the underlying IP for product construction or for one or more components of the product and could seek to have the products made at a variety of manufacturing locations. The Company has a perpetual license to United States Patent No. 8,765,263 “Multilayer Polyurethane Protective Films”.
•Products that are made for us on an exclusive basis – the Company does not own all the underlying IP, but has products made by a third party solely for the Company on an exclusive basis. 
•Products that we source from suppliers on a non-exclusive basis – the Company does not own the underlying IP but sources products on commercial terms from a third party. 
The Company either owns or licenses the relevant IP or has alternative substitutes to continue to operate for the material portion of products sold. 
The loss of our relationship with any of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, could result in the delay of the manufacture and delivery of some of our automotive film products. For more information, see Risk Factor—A material disruption from our contract manufacturers or suppliers, or our inability to obtain a sufficient supply of product from alternate suppliers, could cause us to be unable to meet customer demands or increase our costs.
Government Regulation and Legislation
The manufacturing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising and labeling of our products and our business operations all must comply with extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations and consumer protection laws. Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, capital markets, healthcare costs, energy usage, international trade, immigration and other labor issues, all of which may have a direct or indirect negative effect on our business and our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses. We are also required to comply with certain federal, state and local laws and regulations and industry self-regulatory codes concerning privacy and data security. These laws and regulations require us to provide customers with our policies on sharing information with third parties, and advance notice of any changes to these policies. Related laws may govern the manner in which we store or transfer sensitive information, or impose obligations on us in the event of a security breach or inadvertent disclosure of such information. International jurisdictions impose different, and sometimes more stringent, consumer and privacy protections. 
Our products are subject to export controls, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Controls, and similar laws that apply in other jurisdictions in which we distribute or sell our products. Export control and economic sanctions laws include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to certain embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons and entities. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain products, through import permitting and licensing requirements, as well as customs, duties and similar charges, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products. The exportation, re-exportation, and importation of our products, including by our distributors, must comply with these laws or else we may be adversely affected, through reputational harm, government investigations, penalties, and a denial or curtailment of our ability to export our products. Complying with export control and sanctions laws for a particular sale may be time consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. If we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in substantial fines and penalties for us and for the individuals working for us. Changes in export, sanctions or import laws, may delay the introduction and sale of our product in international markets, or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, regions, 
governments, persons or entities altogether, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
We are also subject to various domestic and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, as well as other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our exposure for violating these laws would increase to the extent our international presence expands and as we increase sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions.
Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation, or “GDPR”, took effect in May 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union. In addition, the GDPR requires submission of breach notifications to our designated European privacy regulator and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The California Consumer Privacy Act, or AB 375, or CCPA, created new data privacy rights for users, beginning in 2020. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.
Environmental Matters
General
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. The Company is ISO 14001:2015 registered and accredited. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs to maintain or achieve compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. To date, these costs have not been material to the Company.
Recycling
The Company strives to be a good steward of the environment. The Company recycles plastic cores, film waste, corrugated boxes and other material related to our conversion operations. We utilize third party software to monitor our progress on this objective. The following represents a summary of our recycling results and impact to the environment in 2022:
Intellectual Property and Brand Protection
We own intellectual property rights, including numerous patents, copyrights and trademarks, that support key aspects of our brand and products. We believe these intellectual property rights, combined with our brand name and reputation, provide us with a competitive advantage. We protect our intellectual property rights in the United States and many international jurisdictions.
We aggressively pursue and defend our intellectual property rights to protect our distinctive brand and products. We have processes and procedures in place to identify and protect our intellectual property assets on a global basis. We utilize legal and brand protection resources to initiate claims and litigation to protect our intellectual property assets. In the future, we intend to continue to seek intellectual property protection for our products and enforce our rights against those who infringe on these valuable assets.
Human Capital Resources
On December 31, 2022, the Company employed approximately 818 people (full-time equivalents), with approximately 567 employed in the United States and 251 employed internationally. We believe that the ability to recruit, retain, develop, protect and fairly compensate our global workforce greatly contributes to the Company’s success. 
In addition to a professional work environment that promotes innovation and rewards performance, the Company’s total compensation for employees includes a variety of components that support sustainable employment and the ability to build a strong financial future, including competitive market-based pay and comprehensive benefits. In addition to earning a base salary, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to the Company’s goals with short-term cash incentives. Through its global pay philosophy, principles and consistent implementation, the Company is committed to providing fair and equitable pay for employees. Eligible full-time employees in the United States also have access to medical, dental and vision plans, savings plans and other resources. Programs and benefits differ internationally for a variety of reasons, such as local legal requirements, market practices and negotiations with work councils, trade unions and other employee representative bodies.
