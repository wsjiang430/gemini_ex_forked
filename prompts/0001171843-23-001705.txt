Overview 
 
XBiotech Inc. (“XBiotech” or the “Company”) is a biopharmaceutical company that discovers and develops True Human™ monoclonal antibodies for treating a variety of diseases. XBiotech was incorporated in Canada on March 22, 2005. The Company’s Internet address is www.xbiotech.com. The Company makes available free of charge on or through its website its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as proxy statements, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company’s website is included in this annual report on Form 10-K as an inactive textual reference only. The information on, or accessible through, the Company’s website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference in, this annual report on Form 10-K. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains these reports at http://www.sec.gov.
 
XBiotech’s True Human™ monoclonal antibodies are derived from human donors that mount a natural human immune response. All other marketed antibody therapeutics are derived from animal immunization or otherwise engineered. It is intuitive that naturally occurring human antibodies have the potential to be safer, more effective and faster to develop than engineered counterparts. XBiotech has developed a pipeline of product candidates targeting both inflammatory and infectious diseases. The Company has also developed manufacturing technology that reduces the cost and time to launch new product candidates. The Company designed and built a state-of-the-art physical plant and infrastructure to manufacture therapeutic antibodies at its Company’s 48 acre research campus in Austin, Texas. XBiotech is thus a fully integrated developer of biopharmaceuticals.
 
An area of medical focus for XBiotech are therapies that block a potent substance, known as interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1a), that mediates tissue breakdown, angiogenesis, the formation of blood clots, malaise, muscle wasting and inflammation. IL-1a is a protein that is on or in cells of the body and is involved in the body’s response to injury or trauma. In almost all chronic and in some acute injury scenarios (such as stroke or heart attack), IL-1a may mediate harmful disease-related activity.
 
At the end of 2019, XBiotech sold a True Human™ antibody therapeutic it was developing that targeted IL-1a for $1.35 billion in cash and potential milestone payments. The unique deal structure had XBiotech agree not to further develop any anti-IL-1a antibodies only for dermatology, while XBiotech was permitted to continue to discover and develop new True Human™ anti-IL-1a antibodies for use in areas of medicine outside of dermatology. The Company quickly identified new IL-1a targeting product candidates that it is has already brought into clinical studies in oncology and rheumatology. While the Company previously was focused on a single True Human™ antibody targeting IL-1a, we are now developing in parallel two product candidates, and may develop one or more others. Since IL-1a is involved in the pathology of multiple diseases, it makes business sense to use different anti-IL-1a antibodies for specific areas of medicine, allowing partnership or sale of each antibody separately for different disease indications.
 
Financial
 
XBiotech received $675 million on December 30, 2019 and $75 million on June 30, 2021 from the sale of of its True Human™ antibody targeting IL-1a. In February 2020, XBiotech used approximately $420 million to repurchase stock from its shareholders. In July 2021, XBiotech distributed $75 million cash dividend to its shareholders. The remaining cash was reserved for ongoing operations as part of its multi-year business plan to identify and develop True Human™ antibodies, including anti-Il-1a therapies, aiming to commercialize these drug candidates.

Since January 1, 2020 XBiotech also used its proprietary manufacturing technology, its manufacturing plant and infrastructure to produce drug product for under a supply agreement. In addition, during 2020 and 2021 XBiotech provided clinical trial operations services for two Phase II clinical studies. In 2022 XBiotech executed a new manufacturing supply agreement to extend its production of the anti-IL-1a antibody it sold. We believe that XBiotech is in a very favorable position for an R&D stage biopharmaceutical company, with a strong cash position in its balance sheet related to sale of its drug candidate, the absence of debt, a robust pipeline and a remarkably modest burn rate.
 
Further Development of IL-1a Therapies
 
IL-1a plays a key role in many disease processes. While it is produced naturally by the body, when not properly controlled, in situations of acute or chronic injury, IL-1a can contribute to the development and progression of a variety of medical conditions, such as cancer, stroke, heart attack or arthritis, to name a few. Completed clinical studies and a myriad of scientific research have shown that blocking IL-1a may have a beneficial effect in some or most of these medical conditions. The potential unmet medical need for blocking IL-1a is therefore very significant. In 2021, the Company entered the clinic with a molecule targeting IL-1⍺ in oncology (Pancreatic Cancer). The Company has also started its clinical program in Rheumatology; and has filed an investigational new drug application for a stroke treatment.
 
Because the potential medical use for anti-IL-1a therapy is so large, the Company is developing more than one True Human™ antibody, each neutralizing IL-1a, but designating different antibodies for use in specific areas of medicine. This will potentially allow XBiotech to individually partner different antibodies according to unique medical areas. The Company expects this will diversify risk for anti-IL-1a therapies, allow multiple partnerships, maximize value and facilitate greater resource dedication to these True Human™ therapeutics.
 
Infectious Disease Pipeline
 
XBiotech continued to achieve significant milestones with its infectious disease pipeline in 2021. The Company has identified several major areas of urgent unmet medical need for True Human™ anti-infective antibody therapies. True Human™ antibodies may be used therapeutically or prophylactically to supplement immunity in individuals where the robustness of the immune system has declined, such as in the elderly or individuals taking immunosuppressive drugs (ie. methotrexate). The Company is confident that Ture Human antibodies can be a highly effective means for providing protection against numerous related infectious diseases, such as shingles or influenza. Donations from blood banks are screened for healthy antibodies that have exceptionally strong natural immunity to specific diseases. True Human™ antibodies are derived only from donors with the best disease fighting antibodies in the population.
 
True Human™ antibodies may also be used to provide highly potent and targeted immunity against infectious diseases in young, otherwise healthy individuals, where infectious agents have overwhelmed natural immunity. For example, this can occur during intravenous drug use, from a deep puncture wound, or from the result of surgery, where bacteria has gained unnatural entry into a body compartment where it can establish and evade the immune system. Staphylococcus aureus, including the deadly methicillin resistant (MRSA) variant, is an example of our candidate anti-infective therapeutics.
 
Another patient population where True Human™ antibodies may be particularly useful is in infants. Prior to developing strong immunity, infants can be vulnerable to infections. Particularly premature infants may need supplemental immunity against specific infectious agents, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In 2022, the Company continued making progress in its search for a True Human™ antibody therapeutic candidate for RSV.
 
    7 

  

We believe True Human™ antibody therapies have a very important application in the case of potent viruses, such as influenza, where the aggressive nature of the virus takes even relatively strong immune systems to the limits. Here again, in elderly, the young or those with weakened immune systems, an aggressive virus like influenza can be life threatening. XBiotech has developed an antibody cocktail that is capable of neutralizing all known forms of influenza—from the deadly 1918 strain to the most recent versions of flu. On its research campus, XBiotech has a fully dedicated infectious disease and animal facility laboratory. The facility is just a short walk from the Company’s main manufacturing headquarters and incorporates an animal biological safety level 2 (ABSL2) infectious disease laboratory for testing the Company’s True Human™ antibodies against infectious disease targets.
 
Infrastructure
 
In 2022 XBiotech completed its expansion of its manufacturing and R&D center. The expansion resulted in the creation of two new wings: one provides state-of-the-art wet laboratory research benches for scientists; another area provides administrative space for dozens of personnel working in manufacturing, clinical and other operations. The building additions have enhanced the Company’s ability to house a larger workforce, expand R&D activities and orchestrate the production of multiple drug products from its existing manufacturing and R&D center. XBiotech owns its 48-acre campus—and all structures on the property—debt-free.
A Background on Therapeutic Antibodies 
 
A century ago, scientists and physicians envisioned being able to custom design therapeutic "antibodies” that were highly specific for a single target. By selectively attacking disease while sparing healthy tissue, these “magic bullets” were anticipated to be ideal therapeutic agents. It was not until the early 1970’s, however, that this vision was realized when Kohler and Milstein developed a ground-breaking method for making target-specific monoclonal antibodies—a Nobel prize-winning endeavor. Using this new approach, numerous monoclonal antibody-based research, diagnostic, and therapeutic products developed.
 
Kohler and Milstein’s discovery was based on their knowledge that the immune system of higher animals produces antibodies as a method of protecting them from various harmful agents, such as viruses, bacteria, and diseased cells. White blood cells, known as B cells, produce billions of different types of antibodies, each with a unique potential to bind and neutralize different disease targets. The vast array of possible treatments based on antibodies led to the development of what is now a major industry around the use of therapeutic antibodies.
 
True Human™ Antibodies 
 
White blood cells in the human body secrete billions of different antibodies that circulate through the blood to react and protect us from toxins, infectious agents or even other unwanted substances produced by our body. True Human™ antibodies, as the name implies, are simply those that are derived from a natural antibody identified from the blood of an individual. To develop a True Human™ antibody therapy, donors are screened to find an individual that has a specific antibody that matches the desired characteristics needed to obtain the intended medical benefit. White blood cells from that individual are obtained, the unique gene that produced the antibody is cloned, and the genetic information is used to produce an exact replica of the antibody sequence. A True Human™ antibody is, therefore, not to be confused with other marketed antibodies, such as so-called “fully human” antibodies—where antibody reactivity is developed through gene sequence engineering in the laboratory.

Fundamental Science of True Human™ Antibodies 

To appreciate the background safety and tolerability of True Human™ antibodies, it is important to consider the fundamental biology of natural antibody production.
 
Billions of different white blood cells secrete billions of unique antibodies every day into circulation. The vast number of different antibodies (and cells that produce them), are essential to enable adequate molecular diversity to ward off a vast range of potential infectious or toxic threats. In other words, since antibodies act to bind and thereby neutralize unwanted agents, any given circulating antibody must be able to react with a potentially limitless number of existing or evolving disease entities.
 
The staggering number of different antibodies needed to achieve this level of preparedness, however, is a daunting concept from a genetics point of view. If an individual antibody gene was needed to encode each of a billion different antibodies, there would be approximately 20,000 times as many genes needed just for antibodies as there would be needed to encode the rest of the entire human genome. Individual cells would need to be gigantic, and monumental resources of the body would be required to make, copy and maintain all of the DNA. Clearly, the system of antibodies could not have evolved to protect us, had not an elegant solution emerged to deal with this genetic conundrum.
 
Thus, a hallmark of the immune physiology of all vertebrates (all have antibodies) is the ability to recombine and selectively mutate a relatively small number of gene segments to create a phenomenal and effectively unlimited number of antibody genes. By rearranging, recombining and mutating the genetic code, specialized white blood cells, or B lymphocytes, are able to create an unlimited array of antibody genes. The consequence of this genetic engineering, however, is that each antibody gene is unique to the individual B lymphocyte that created it—and no copy of the gene exists in the human germline. The only place to find a unique antibody gene is in the individual cells that created it.
 
The extraordinary process of gene rearrangement and mutation results in a multitude of unique B lymphocytes and consequently an incredibly diverse repertoire of antibodies in any given individual.
 
Elucidating the mechanisms behind the production of unique antibody genes must be considered one of the major achievements of medical research in the 20th century. Yet unfolding this mystery created another problem to solve: If antibodies were not produced from genes encoded in the human genome and the products of these genes were new to the body, why were these antibody molecules not recognized by the immune system as foreign substances—like any other foreign substance that they were intended to eradicate? How could the body distinguish the apparently “foreign” antibody molecules from the bona fide infectious intruders?
 
Unraveling the genetics of antibody production led to another major advance in medicine: the discovery of how an endless array of antibody proteins could be made in a way that individual molecules were always tolerated by the body.
 
In the early 1990s, research began to demonstrate that the production of antibodies was not an unregulated process. Rather, it was learned that the antibodies produced by each and every B lymphocyte were subject to intense scrutiny. Studies showed that B lymphocytes which produced acceptable antibodies were stimulated to grow while those that produced “autoreactive” antibodies were not. B lymphocytes that produced “good” antibodies were stimulated to proliferate and enabled to produce copious amounts of antibody in the event it was needed to ward off a harmful agent. B lymphocytes that rearranged genes to produce antibodies that were ineffective or were autoreactive were given signals that instructed them to engage in a process of programmed cell death. Thus, B lymphocytes producing harmful or useless antibodies are simply killed off. This mechanism for creating antibody diversity on the one hand, while protecting the individual from a mass of unwanted or intolerable antibody molecules on the other, was as elegant as it was fundamental to the success of vertebrate immune physiology.
 
This process of “selection” has been elucidated in great detail. There can be no more important feature of immune physiology than the process of selection. Selection is a fundamental step to enable the body to produce an extremely diverse set of antibody molecules without, in the process, producing an array of novel molecules that cause harm.

Industry Context 
 
Until now each and every therapeutic antibody on the market has been derived from animals and/or through gene sequence modification in the laboratory to produce a desired antibody reactivity. Marketed antibodies to date, described as “fully human”, are not derived from human gene sequences that have undergone the crucial process of selection in a human.
 
Without exception, all marketed products to date that are described as “fully human”, are in fact engineered and are not selected based on natural tolerance in the human body. The use of the term “fully human” to describe these products has thus created considerable confusion. To our knowledge, there are at present no True Human™ antibodies manufactured, using recombinant protein technology, currently marketed.
 
Platform Technology 
 
Our True Human™ antibody therapeutics are developed in-house using our proprietary discovery platform. There are significant technical challenges in identifying and cloning genes for True Human™ antibodies. A key problem to overcome can be to first identify individuals with the desired antibody reactivity. This can involve screening thousands of blood donors to enable the identification of a single, clinically relevant antibody—discovered from literally trillions of irrelevant background antibody molecules in the blood of donors. To distinguish the clinically relevant antibodies from irrelevant background antibody molecules in donor bloods, we use our Super High Stringency Antibody Mining (SHSAM™) technology. White blood cells from that individual can then be isolated, and the unique gene that produced the native antibody obtained. We currently obtain blood donor samples through a Research and Collaboration Agreement with the South Texas Blood & Tissue Center, a Texas 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation.
 
Novel cloning technologies developed at XBiotech have enabled us to clone the crucial antibody gene sequences from these donors in order to reproduce a True Human™ antibody for use in clinical therapy. A True Human™ monoclonal antibody should therefore not be confused with other marketed therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, such as those currently referred to as “fully human” antibodies.
 
Market Opportunity 
 
We have a number of indications in various stages of clinical or pre-clinical development with significant market opportunities. These include an array of inflammatory conditions as well as infectious disease indications. The potential market opportunities in these various indications are vast and we believe our research and manufacturing technologies, designed to more rapidly, cost-effectively and flexibly produce new therapies, will be advantageous in each market space.
Our Strategy 
 
Our objective is to fundamentally change the way drugs are developed and commercialized and become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapeutic True Human™ antibodies.
Product Pipeline 
 
Our product development status for the end of the year 2022 was as follows:

Employees and Human Capital
 
Our management team is comprised of highly experienced pharmaceutical and biotechnology executives with successful track records in researching, developing, gaining approval for and commercializing novel medicines to treat serious diseases. Together, the management team has covered the spectrum of pharmaceutical antibody and drug discovery, preclinical research, formulation development, manufacturing, human clinical trials, regulatory submissions and approval, and global commercialization. Additionally, the team has significant experience in company formation, capital raises, mergers/acquisitions, business development, and sales and marketing in the biopharmaceutical industry. Our board of directors (“Board”) is constituted by individuals with significant experience in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. As of December 31, 2022, we had 85 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
 
We are committed to growing our business over the long term. As a result of the competitive nature of the industry in which we operate, employees have significant career mobility and as a result, the competition for experienced employees is great. The existence of this competition, and the need for talented and experienced employees to realize our business objectives, underlies the design and implementation of our compensation programs. At the same time, we seek to keep our approach to compensation simple and streamlined to reflect the still relatively moderate size of our company. We have compensation, leave and benefits programs necessary to attract and retain the talented and experienced employees necessary to develop our business including competitive salaries, stock options awards to permanent employees, both upon initial hiring and annually thereafter, and pay annual bonuses to permanent employees contingent on the achievement of corporate and/or personal objectives. We have developed an Employee Handbook that contains all corporate policies and guidelines for professional behavior. Our policies and practices apply to all employees, regardless of title. These guidelines include our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which is posted on our website.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, commencing in March 2020, we implemented a work-from-home mandate and ceased all non-essential business travel. In the recent months, some employees have recommenced limited business travel and some have transitioned back to working on-site in conjunction with the implementation of additional safety and infection prevention measures including enhanced cleaning, additional personal protective equipment, and contact tracing protocols. We continue to provide our employees with the option to work from home.
 
    11 

  

Competition 
 
The therapeutic antibody space is dynamic as there continues to be a highly active commercial pipeline of therapeutic antibodies globally, involving a complex array of development cycles as products reach the end of their patent life and as new candidate products proceed into pivotal studies and approach registration. There are numerous independent reviews on the subject in both trade journals and academic press (one such example being Reichert JM, Antibodies to watch in 2018 MAbs. 2018 Jan 4:1-21).
 
We believe True Human™ therapeutic antibodies have important differentiating factors from other monoclonal antibodies currently marketed. However, regardless of the potential advantages or uniqueness of our current or future product candidates in the market, we do expect these products to compete head-to-head with the numerous existing candidate antibody products in development, including emerging biosimilar therapeutic antibodies.
 
Safety 
 
The Company’s True Human™ antibodies are derived from a natural human immune response. It is expected that this will facilitate better tolerability when used as a therapeutic compared to humanized or “fully human” monoclonal antibodies. Antibody therapies are known to be associated with significant risk for infusion reactions, including serious anaphylactic reactions. It is the Company’s belief that these reactions are, in large part, the result of using antibodies that were not derived from natural human immunity but rather had engineered specificities.
Intellectual Property 
 
XBiotech has developed a large international intellectual property (IP) portfolio to protect important aspects of its technology, services, and products, including patents, trademarks and trade secrets.
Governmental Regulations
 
We operate in an industry that is regulated by various governmental agencies both in the U.S. and globally. The success of our business is heavily dependent on our products gaining regulatory approval. The compliance with regulations by the FDA in the U.S., the European Medicines Agency, or EMA in the European Union and other regulatory bodies in other geographic areas has a material effect on our capital expenditures, our earnings and competitive positions.
 
Our ability to finance our operations and commercialize our products (both in the U.S. and abroad) are tied to our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products. In the U.S., the FDA strictly regulates the advertising and promotion of drug products, and drug products may only be marketed or promoted for their FDA approved uses, consistent with the product’s approved labeling. Advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval in the U.S. and is covered by federal insurance programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, will be heavily scrutinized by the FDA, the Department of Justice, (DOJ), the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, (HHS), state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public. The regulatory approval process is unpredictable, costly and time-consuming with no guaranteed positive outcomes. Even if we believe clinical trials to be successful, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may deem our clinical trials insufficient and not providing adequate data on safety and adequacy. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory approvals, if and when obtained, may contain substantial limitations on the use of the product, which would restrict our ability to sell the products to the public at large.
 
In the European Union and many other jurisdictions, in order to market and sell our products, we must obtain separate marketing approvals, such as from the EMA, and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is possible that none of the product candidates we are developing or may discover in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. Change in political leadership within the U.S. and elsewhere could result in shifts in regulatory policies as they pertain to our business. While we may be able to anticipate certain changes, policy statements often are not always translated into actionable legislation. Therefore, future regulatory changes may have a material impact on the timing and process of obtaining the regulatory approval for our product candidates.
 
    12 

  

Environmental Regulations
 
Our business is subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations both in the U.S. and elsewhere, which include regulations relating to the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste.
 
We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials, which would result in us being liable for resulting damages, including significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines or penalties.
