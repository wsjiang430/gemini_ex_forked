Overview
 SPS Commerce is a leading provider of cloud-based supply chain management services that make it easier for retailers, suppliers, grocers, distributors and logistics firms to orchestrate the management of item data, order fulfillment, inventory control and sales analytics across all channels. Implementing and maintaining a suite of supply chain management capabilities is resource intensive and is not a core competency for most businesses. The services offered by SPS Commerce eliminate the need for on-premise software and support staff by taking on that capability on the customer’s behalf.  The services SPS Commerce provides allow our customers to increase their supply cycle agility, optimize their inventory levels and sell-through, reduce operational costs and gain increased visibility into customer orders, ensuring that suppliers, grocers, distributors, and logistics firms can satisfy exacting retailer requirements. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 29,000 customers with contracts to pay us monthly fees, which we refer to as recurring revenue customers.  We have also generated revenues by providing our cloud-based supply chain management services to an additional 51,000 organizations that, together with our recurring revenue customers, we refer to as our customers.  Once connected to the SPS Commerce Platform, our customers often require integrations to new organizations that represent an expansion of our Platform and new sources of revenues for us.
 For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we generated revenues of $248.2 million, $220.1 million and $193.2 million, respectively.  Our fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018 represented our 72nd consecutive quarter of increased revenues.  Recurring revenues from recurring revenue customers accounted for 93%, 93% and 92% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Our revenues are not concentrated with any customer, as our largest customer represented less than 1% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017 and less than 2% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 Our Solutions 
 SPS Commerce operates one of the largest retail trading partner networks through cloud-based services that improve the way retailers, suppliers, grocers, distributors and logistics firms manage and fulfill orders, administer sell-through performance and source new items. Today, approximately 80,000 customers across more than 60 countries are using SPS Commerce solutions to expand and optimize the performance of their trading relationships.
 The SPS Commerce business model fundamentally changes how organizations use electronic communication to manage their omnichannel, supply chain, and other business requirements by replacing the collection of traditional, custom-built, point-to-point integrations with a model that facilitates a single automated connection to the entire SPS Commerce network of trading partners.
 From that single connection, a member of our network can make use of the full suite of our services, from fulfillment automation, to the analysis and optimization of item sell-through performance, to sourcing new items, retailing relationships, logistics providers, or other services.  These cloud services deliver value as stand-alone offerings but can also provide greater value when used collectively. This represents a fundamental change to fulfillment automation and enables inherent adaptability and flexibility not possible with traditional supply chain management system architectures.
 Our fulfillment service allows customers to comply with numerous rulebooks for retailers, grocers and distributors. Maintaining current connections with retailers, grocers, and distributors removes the need for their trading partners to continually stay up-to-date with their required rulebook change. The utilization of a cloud services model eliminates or greatly reduces the burden on trading partners to support and maintain an on-premise software application, thereby reducing ongoing operating costs. As the transaction hub for trading partners, we can provide increased performance visibility and data analytics capabilities across their supply chains, each of which is difficult to gain from traditional, point-to-point integration solutions.

The following services are enabled through the SPS Commerce cloud services Platform:
  
• | Trading Partner Community. The Community solution empowers retailers, grocers, and distributors to introduce changes to their supply chain requirements to their trading partner community, and onboard new vendors quickly to receive their first orders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Trading Partner Fulfillment. The Fulfillment solution provides fulfillment automation and replaces or augments an organization’s existing staff and trading partner electronic communication infrastructure by enabling easy compliance with retailers’ rulebooks, electronic exchange of information among numerous trading partners through various protocols, and greater visibility into the journey of an order. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Trading Partner Assortment. Today’s retail marketplace requires the management of tens and even hundreds of individual attributes associated with each item a retailer or supplier sells. This information can include supply chain descriptions and measurements, store and shelf dimensions, warehouse dimensions, digital images/video, customer facing descriptions and measurements, and warehouse information. The Assortment solution provides robust, extensible, management of this information, enabling accurate orders and rapid fulfillment. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Trading Partner Analytics. The Analytics solution consists of data analytics applications that allow our customers to improve their visibility across, and analysis of, their supply chains. When focused on point-of-sale data, for example, retailers and suppliers can ensure inventory is located where demand is highest. Additionally, retailers improve their visibility into supplier performance and their understanding of product sell-through. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Trading Partner Sourcing. Through the Sourcing Solution, retailers can leverage our social network for the retail industry, and source providers of new items, suppliers can connect with new retailers, and the broader retailing community can make connections to expand their business networks and grow.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Trading Partner Solutions. We provide a number of peripheral solutions such as barcode labeling, planogram services and our scan and pack application, which helps trading partners process information to streamline the picking and packaging process.

Our Customer and Sales Sources
 As one of the largest providers of cloud services for retail supply chain management, the trading partner relationships that we enable among our retailer, supplier, grocer, distributor, and logistics customers naturally lead to new customer acquisition opportunities.
“Network Effect”
 Once connected to our network, trading partners can exchange electronic supply chain information with each other. The value of our network increases with the number of trading partners connected to it. The addition of each new customer enables that new customer to communicate with our existing customers and permits our existing customers to do business with the new customer. Additionally, through our Sourcing service, our community now has a social network focused on facilitating connections and business interactions among retailers and suppliers.  This “network effect” of adding additional customers to our solutions infrastructure creates a significant opportunity for existing customers to realize incremental sales by working with our new trading partners and vice versa. As a result of this increased volume of activity among our network participants, we earn additional revenues from these participants.

Customer Acquisition Sources
 Community.  As retailers and suppliers reshape how they do business in an omnichannel landscape, they need to bring new capabilities and services to their trading partner networks.  For instance, a supplier may wish to collaborate with their retailers around point-of-sale analytics data, or a retailer may decide to change the workflow or protocol by which it interacts with its suppliers.  In each case, the supplier and retailer may engage us to work with its trading partner base to enable the new capability.  Performing these programs on behalf of retailers and suppliers often generates supplier sales leads for us.
 Referrals from Our Customers. We also receive sales leads from our customers seeking to communicate electronically with their trading partners.  For example, a supplier may refer to us its third-party logistics provider or manufacturer which is not in our network.
 Channel Partners. In addition to the customer acquisition sources identified above, we market and sell our solutions through a variety of channel partners including software providers, resellers, system integrators and logistics partners.  For example, software partners such as Microsoft, NetSuite, Oracle, SAP, Sage and their business partner communities generate sales for us as part of broader enterprise resource planning, warehouse management system and/or transportation management system sales efforts.  Our logistics partners also drive new sales both by providing leads and by embedding our solutions as part of their service offerings.
Our Sales Force
 We also sell our solutions through a global sales force which is organized as follows:
  
• | Retailer Sales. We employ a team of sales representatives who focus on selling our cloud services suite to retailers and distributors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supplier Sales. We employ a team of supplier sales representatives focused on selling our cloud services suite to suppliers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Logistic Sales. We employ a team of logistic sales representatives focused on selling our cloud services suite to logistic service providers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Business Development Efforts. Our business development organization is tasked with finding new sources of revenue and development of new business opportunities through channel partners and other areas that present an opportunity for growth.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
 Our objective is to be the leading global provider of supply chain management solutions.  Key elements of our strategy include:
  
• | Further Penetrate Our Current Market. We believe the global supply chain management market is underpenetrated and, as the retail industry continues to respond to the changing requirements of the omnichannel marketplace, and as the supply chain ecosystem becomes more complex and geographically dispersed, the demand for supply chain management solutions will increase, especially among small- and medium-sized businesses. We intend to continue leveraging our relationships with customers and their trading partners to obtain new sales leads. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase Revenues from Our Customer Base. We believe our overall customer satisfaction is strong and will lead our customers to further expand their use of the solutions they have purchased, as well as purchase additional services to continue improving the performance of their trading partner relationships, generating additional revenues for us. We also expect to introduce new solutions to sell to our customers. We believe our position as the incumbent supply chain management solution provider to our customers, our integration into our recurring revenue customers’ business systems and the modular nature of our Platform are conducive to deploying additional solutions with customers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Our Distribution Channels. We intend to grow our business by expanding our sales capacity to gain new customers. We also believe there are valuable opportunities to promote and sell our solutions through collaboration with other providers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Expand Our International Presence. We believe our presence in the Asia Pacific, as well as in Europe, represents a significant competitive advantage. We plan to increase our global sales efforts to obtain new customers around the world. We intend to leverage our current global presence to increase the number of integrations we have with retailers in foreign markets to make our solutions more valuable to their trading partners based overseas. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhance and Expand Our Services. We intend to further improve and develop the functionality and features of our Platform, including, from time to time, developing new solutions and applications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. The fragmented nature of our market provides an opportunity for selective acquisitions. We plan to evaluate potential acquisitions based on the number of new customers, revenue, functionality, or geographic reach the acquisition would provide relative to the purchase price and our ability to integrate and operate the acquired business. In 2018, we acquired EDIAdmin, a leading provider of supply chain integration technology. Also, in 2018, we acquired CovalentWorks, a provider of cloud-based EDI solutions to small- and medium-sized businesses. These acquisitions further extended the power of our network.

Technology, Development and Operations
 Technology
 SPS Commerce was an early provider of cloud services to the retail supply chain management industry, launching the first version of what would become our current services in 1997.  We use commercially available hardware and cloud services with a combination of proprietary and commercially available software.
 Our cloud service model treats all customers as logically separate tenants within a shared virtual infrastructure.  As a result, we spread the cost of delivering our solutions across our customer base.  Because we do not manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemes, we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors, even those that modified their products to be accessible over the Internet.
 Development
 Our research and development efforts focus on maintaining, improving and enhancing our existing solutions, as well as developing new solutions and applications.  Our multi-tenant solutions serve all of our customers, which allows us to maintain relatively low research and development expenses and release software updates more frequently compared to traditional on-premise licensed software solutions that support multiple versions.  Our development efforts take place at our U.S. locations in Minnesota and New Jersey; as well as in Melbourne, Australia; Toronto, Canada; and Kiev, Ukraine.
Operations
 We operate our infrastructure in third-party data centers located in Minnesota, New Jersey, and Melbourne, Australia, as well as provisioned services in public cloud providers. In all cases, infrastructure and services are managed by us.
 We have internal and third-party monitoring software that continually checks our network and key underlying components for continuous availability and performance, ensuring the network is always available and providing adequate service levels. We have a technology operations team that provides system provisioning, management, maintenance, monitoring and back-up.
 We operate a service architecture using industry best practices to ensure multiple points of redundancy, high availability and scale as needed.  Our databases are replicated between locations with a defined recovery point objective.

Our Customers
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 29,000 recurring revenue customers and approximately 80,000 total customers.  Our primary source of revenue is from small- to mid-sized suppliers.  We also generate revenues from other members of the supply chain ecosystem, including retailers, distributors, third-party logistics providers and other trading partners.  Our revenues are not concentrated with any customer, as our largest customer represented less than 1% of total revenues for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and less than 2% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Competition
 Vendors in the supply chain management industry offer solutions through three delivery methods: traditional on-premise software, cloud-based managed services and cloud-based full-service solutions.
 The market for cloud-based supply chain management solutions is fragmented and rapidly evolving.  Cloud service vendors compete directly with each other based on the following:
  
• | the breadth of pre-built connections to retailers, third-party logistics providers, and other trading partners;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a history of establishing and maintaining reliable connections with trading partners;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a reputation of the cloud service vendor in the supply chain management industry;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | price;
--+-------


• | specialization in a customer market segment;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | speed and quality with which the cloud service vendor can integrate its customers to their trading partners;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | functionality of the cloud service solution, such as the ability to integrate the solution with a customer’s business systems;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | breadth of complementary supply chain management solutions the cloud service vendor offers; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | training and customer support services provided during and after a customer’s initial integration.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect to encounter new and increased competition as this market segment consolidates and matures.  Consolidation among cloud service vendors could create a direct competitor that can compete with us more effectively than the numerous, smaller vendors currently offering cloud service supply chain management solutions.  Increased competition from cloud service vendors could reduce our market share, revenues, and operating margins or otherwise adversely affect our business.
 Cloud service vendors also compete with traditional on-premise software companies.  Traditional on-premise software companies focused on supply chain integration management include IBM Sterling Commerce and OpenText-GXS.  These companies offer a “do-it-yourself” approach in which customers purchase, install, and manage specialized software, hardware and value-added networks for their supply chain integration needs.  This approach requires customers to invest in staff to operate and maintain the software.  Traditional on-premise software companies use a single-tenant approach in which information maps to retailers are built for and used by one supplier, as compared to cloud service solutions that allow multiple customers to share information maps with a retailer.
 Managed service providers focused on the supply chain management market include IBM Sterling Commerce, OpenText GXS, TrueCommerce, DiCentral, B2B Gateway and many other small providers. These companies offer a cloud-based solution in which they develop and maintain the core technology, while the customer’s internal staff is responsible for the day-to-day customization, optimization, and operations of the technology.
In contrast, full-service providers, including SPS Commerce, offer cloud-based solutions and that customize, optimize and operate the technology. This approach offloads the time-intensive process of managing these solutions, which is not a core competency for most businesses.

Customers of traditional on-premise software providers must typically make significant upfront investments in the supply chain management solutions these competitors provide, which can decrease the customers’ willingness to abandon their investments in favor of a cloud service solution.  Cloud service vendors compete with these traditional software solutions based on total cost of ownership and flexibility.  
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Content
 SPS Commerce relies on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.  We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information.  We have registered trademarks and pending trademark applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. 
 Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic.  Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use.  We do not have any patents, but we have pending patent applications.  Our trade secrets consist primarily of the software we have developed for our SPS Commerce Network.  Our software is also protected under copyright law, but we do not have any registered copyrights.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,231 employees.  We also employ independent contractors to support our operations.  We believe that our continued success will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain skilled technical and sales personnel.  We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by a labor union.  We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
