Item 1.    Business
Incorporated in 1991, OpenText has grown to be a leader in providing Enterprise Information Management (EIM) solutions. We offer a comprehensive line of products and services that aim to enable businesses to grow faster, obtain lower operational costs and reduce information governance and security risks by improving business insight, impact and process speed.
Our software is offered through traditional on-premises solutions, on the OpenText Cloud or a combination of both. We believe our customers will operate in hybrid on-premises and cloud environments, and we are ready to support the delivery method the customer prefers. In providing choice and flexibility, we strive to maximize the lifetime value of the relationship with our customers. 
Business Overview and Strategy
About OpenText 
For more than 25 years, we have developed enterprise software to help customers create a sustainable information advantage in the digital economy. We have a vision of the "Intelligent and Connected Enterprise" enabling businesses and 

governments to accelerate their digital transformation. The comprehensive OpenText EIM platform and suite of software products and services provide secure and scalable solutions for global companies and governments around the world. With our software, organizations manage a valuable asset - information. Information that is made more valuable by connecting it to digital business processes, information that is enriched with analytics, information that is protected and secure throughout its entire lifecycle, information that captivates customers, and information that connects and fuels some of the world's largest digital supply chains in manufacturing, retail, and financial services. Our EIM solutions are designed to enable organizations to secure their information so that they can collaborate with confidence, validate endpoints with all machines and the Internet of Things (IoT), stay ahead of the regulatory technology curve, identify threats that cross their networks, leverage discovery with information forensics, and gain insight and action through analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation.
At OpenText, we follow the big workloads and the unstructured content from customer information and case files, to employee information, transactions and interactions along the supply chain, to information used to manage assets such as planes, trains, automobiles, nuclear power plants, and oil rigs, to industry accelerators like information technology (IT) and innovation platforms. 
Our Products and Services
We combine digital applications with an information platform, bringing together Content Services, Business Networks (BN), Analytics and AI, Security and the Developer for optimized customer experience, employee engagement, asset utilization, and supply chain efficiency. Our software capabilities bring together information from both humans and machines, where it can be securely managed, stored, accessed and mined with analytics for actionable and relevant insights.
*Off-cloud is a term we use to describe license transactions
Below is a listing of our EIM solutions. In all of this, the developer is critical to the development of "secure-from-day-1" applications. This is why our EIM platform expands our low-code development capabilities with additional out-of-the-box integrations designed to support the developer with a unified application development environment. In addition, with our cloud-based IoT platform, the enterprise can dynamically integrate multi-tiered supply chain communities and build IoT solutions for greater efficiency, agility, and new value-added services. Information from machines is supported, whether it's a smart machine, industrial machine, or an automotive or medical device.
Content Services
Content Services, such as Extended Enterprise Content Management (ECM) and records management, integrate with platforms, such as SAP, to manage the entire lifecycle of information, in its many formats, from creation through to disposition. 

Our Content Services help organizations connect content to their digital business to accelerate productivity, improve governance and drive digital transformation. Additionally, OpenText Content Services adhere to the Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) standard and support a broad range of operating systems, databases, application servers, and enterprise applications. Our Content Services solutions range from intelligent capture to records management and archiving and are available on-premises, as a subscription in the OpenText Cloud or as a managed service.
Business Network 
The OpenText Business Network (BN) supports intelligent connections at a global scale providing a proven foundation for digital business and secure e-commerce.
Our BN is a cloud-based platform that facilitates efficient, secure and compliant collaboration and exchange of information inside and outside of organizations. The platform comprises solutions that simplify the inherent complexities of business-to-business (B2B) data exchange and offer insights that help drive operational efficiencies, accelerate time to transaction and improve customer satisfaction. Our BN enables businesses to accelerate and control how information is delivered which we believe increases the security and reliability of sensitive or complex communications.
Artificial Intelligence and Analytics
The OpenText Artificial Intelligence platform incorporates Apache Spark, the powerful, open source computing foundation that lets customers take advantage of the flexibility, extensibility, and diversity of an open product stack while maintaining full ownership of their data and algorithms. As our enterprise software has historically focused on managing data and content archives, we are now able to turn these archives of data into active “data lakes” and incorporate AI to transform this digital information into useful knowledge and insight for our customers.
Our analytics and AI suite helps organizations improve decision-making, gain operational efficiency and increase visibility by enabling IT to place interactive dashboards, reports and data visualizations quickly into the hands of business users. Our AI leverages a comprehensive set of data analytics software to identify patterns, relationships and trends. Our analytics and AI suite can leverage structured or unstructured data to help organizations increase their opportunities for growth. 
Security
The OpenText EIM platform offers multi-level, multi-role, multi context security to make it one of the most secure information platforms in the world. Information is secured at the database level, by user enrolled security, context rights, and time-based security. Our EIM platform supports single sign-on for system protection and encryption at rest for document-level security.
OpenText security also helps organizations address information security and digital investigation needs with leading digital forensic tools for endpoint detection and response. EncaseTM provides 360-degree visibility across all endpoints, devices and networks, for proactive discovery of sensitive data, identification and remediation of threats and discreet, forensically-sound data collection and investigation.
Digital Process Automation (DPA)
Our DPA enables organizations to transform into digital, data-driven businesses through automation. Our DPA solutions simplify and streamline processes from front office to back office with intelligent automation, artificial intelligence and ready access to valuable enterprise information.
Customer Experience Management (CEM)
CEM is a set of processes used to track customer interactions throughout the customer journey. The purpose of CEM is to gain insight into these customer interactions and optimize them to drive loyalty and improve customer lifetime value. Our CEM platform suite offers a set of CEM solutions and extensions that focus on delivering highly personalized content and customer engagement along a continuous customer journey. Our CEM suite also helps provide a solid foundation for implementing a successful customer experience strategy.
Discovery
Our Discovery suite provides leading forensics and unstructured data analytics for searching, collecting, and investigating enterprise data to manage legal obligations and risk. Our Discovery suite has powerful machine learning capabilities to help legal and compliance teams quickly find critical information for litigation discovery, investigations, compliance, data breach response, business projects, and financial contract analysis.
Our Strategy
Growth
As an organization, our management believes in delivering “Total Growth”, meaning we strive towards delivering value through organic initiatives, innovations and acquisitions, as well as financial performance. This growth is further enhanced through our direct and indirect sales distribution channels. With an emphasis on increasing recurring revenues and expanding our margins, we believe our “Total Growth” strategy will ultimately drive overall cash flow generation, thus helping to fuel our disciplined capital allocation approach and further drive our ability to deepen our account coverage and identify and execute strategic acquisitions. With strategic acquisitions, we are better positioned to expand our product portfolio and improve our ability to innovate and grow organically, which then further helps us to meet our long-term growth targets. We believe this “Total Growth” strategy is a durable model that will create shareholder value over both the near and long-term.
We are committed to continuous innovation. Our investments in research and development (R&D) drive product innovation, increasing the value of our offerings to our installed customer base, which includes Global 10,000 companies. The Global 10,000 are the worlds largest companies, typically those with greater than $2billion in revenues, as well as the world's largest governments and organizations. More valuable products, coupled with our established global partner program, lead to greater distribution and cross-selling opportunities which further help us to achieve organic growth. Over the last three fiscal years, we have invested a cumulative total of approximately $926 million in R&D or approximately 11.6% of cumulative revenue for such three year period and we typically target to spend approximately 11% to 13% of revenues for R&D each fiscal year.
We remain a value oriented and disciplined acquirer and consolidator, having efficiently deployed $6.2 billion on acquisitions over the last 10 years. Mergers and acquisitions are one of our leading growth drivers. We believe in creating value by focusing on acquiring strategic businesses, integrating them into our business model and using our acquired assets to innovate. We have developed a philosophy, which we refer to as “The OpenText Business System”, that is designed to create value by leveraging a clear set of operational mandates for integrating newly acquired companies and assets. We see our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and assets into our business as a strength and pursuing strategic acquisitions is an important aspect to our Total Growth strategy. We expect to continue to acquire strategically, to integrate and innovate, to deepen and strengthen our intelligent information platform for customers.
In Fiscal 2019, we further demonstrated the implementation of our strategy by acquiring Liaison Technologies, Inc. (Liaison) and Catalyst Repository Systems Inc. (Catalyst). We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis and at any time may be at various stages of discussion with respect to such opportunities. For additional details on our acquisitions, please see "Acquisitions During the Last Five Fiscal Years", elsewhere in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our OpenText Release 16 platform (Release 16), helps organizations with their digital transformation by digitizing information, experiences, processes and supply chains, to create a better way to work within their enterprise. Release 16 has a major focus on analysis and reporting across all product lines and use cases. It offers customers a coordinated platform for digital transformation that is intended to yield the benefits of scale and single-vendor interaction. 
We also introduced OpenText OT2, the next generation EIM as a service platform. With OT2, organizations can leverage existing investments in their on-premises platforms and extend solutions where cloud can quickly improve time to value, such as customer, supplier and partner collaboration. Delivering SaaS applications that extend existing solutions prevents new information silos and simplifies technology investment decisions by providing compelling enterprise applications for business users.
We continue to make significant investments to our cloud infrastructure, and with products like Release 16 and OT2, virtually all of our products are available in the "OpenText Cloud". 
Looking Towards the Future
In Fiscal 2020 we intend to continue to implement strategies that are designed to: 
Broaden Our Reach into EIM through the Global 10,000. As technologies and customers become more sophisticated, we intend to be a leader in expanding the definition of traditional market sectors. This is the marquee target for EIM and organic growth. We continue to focus on connecting the G10K to our information platform and we believe we are well positioned to expand our penetration in this market.
Invest in the Cloud. The cloud is quickly becoming a business imperative. What used to be discussed as a potential option for managing budgets, is now a strategic direction that drives competitive positioning, product innovation, business agility, and cost management. We are committed to continue our investment in The OpenText Cloud, which is a purpose-built cloud 

environment for enterprise solutions spanning Information Management, Compliance, and B2B Integration. Supported by a global, scalable, and secure infrastructure, OpenText Cloud includes a foundational platform of technology services, and packaged business applications for industry and business processes. The OpenText Cloud enables organizations to protect and manage information in public, private or hybrid deployments.
Deepen Existing Customer Footprint. We believe one of our greatest opportunities is to sell newly acquired technologies to our existing customer base, and cross-sell historical OpenText products to newly acquired customers. We have significant expertise in a number of industry sectors and aim to increase our customer penetration based on our strong credentials. We are particularly focused on circumstances where the customer is looking to consolidate multiple vendors with solutions from a single source while addressing a broader spectrum of business problems or equally new or existing customers looking to take a more holistic approach to digital transformation.
Invest in Technology Leadership. We believe we are well-positioned to develop additional innovative solutions to address the evolving market. We plan to continue investing in technology “innovation” by funding internal development as well as collaborating with third-parties.
Deepen Strategic Partnerships. OpenText is committed culturally, programmatically and strategically to be a partner-embracing company. Our partnerships with companies such as SAP SE, Google Cloud, Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Salesforce.com Corporation and others serve as an example of how we are working together with our partners to create next-generation EIM solutions and deliver them to market. We will continue to look for ways to create more customer value from our strategic partnerships.
Broaden Global Presence. As customers become increasingly multi-national and as international markets continue to adopt EIM, we plan to further grow our brand, presence, and partner networks in these new markets. We are focused on using our direct sales for targeting existing customers and plan to address new geographies jointly with our partners.
Selectively Pursue Acquisitions. We expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions to strengthen our service offerings in the EIM market. In light of the continually evolving marketplace in which we operate, we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities within the EIM market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities. We plan to continue to pursue acquisitions that complement our existing business, represent a strong strategic fit and are consistent with our overall growth strategy and disciplined financial management. We may also target future acquisitions to expand or add functionality and capabilities to our existing portfolio of solutions, as well as add new solutions to our portfolio.
OpenText Revenues
Our business consists of four revenue streams: license, cloud services and subscriptions, customer support, and professional service and other. For information regarding our revenues and assets by geography for Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, see note 19 “Segment Information” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
License
License revenues consist of fees earned from the licensing of software products to our customers. Our license revenues are impacted by the strength of general economic and industry conditions, the competitive strength of our software products, and our acquisitions. The decision by a customer to license our software products often involves a comprehensive implementation process across the customer’s network or networks and the licensing and implementation of our software products may entail a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers.
Cloud Services and Subscriptions
Cloud services and subscription revenues consist of (i) SaaS offerings, (ii) hosted services and (iii) managed service arrangements. These offerings allow customers to transmit a variety of content between various mediums and to securely manage enterprise information without the commitment of investing in related hardware infrastructure.
We offer B2B integration solutions such as messaging and managed services. Messaging services allow for the automated and reliable exchange of electronic transaction information, such as purchase orders, invoices, shipment notices and other business documents, among businesses worldwide. Managed services provide an end-to-end fully outsourced B2B integration solution to our customers, including program implementation, operational management, and customer support. Our cloud-based Business Network enables customers to effectively manage the flow of electronic transaction information with their trading partners and reduces the complexity of disparate standards and communication protocols.
Customer Support
The first year of our customer support offering is usually purchased by customers together with the license of our EIM software products. Customer support is typically renewed on an annual basis and historically customer support revenues have been a significant portion of our total revenue. Through our OpenText customer support programs, customers receive access to software upgrades, a knowledge base, discussions, product information, and an online mechanism to post and review “trouble tickets”. Additionally, our customer support teams handle questions on the use, configuration, and functionality of OpenText products and can help identify software issues, develop solutions, and document enhancement requests for consideration in future product releases.
Professional Service and Other
We provide consulting and learning services to customers and generally these services relate to the implementation, training and integration of our licensed product offerings into the customer's systems.
Our consulting services help customers build solutions that enable them to leverage their investments in our technology and in existing enterprise systems. The implementation of these services can range from simple modifications to meet specific departmental needs to enterprise applications that integrate with multiple existing systems.
Our learning services consultants analyze our customers' education and training needs, focusing on key learning outcomes and timelines, with a view to creating an appropriate education plan for the employees of our customers who work with our products. Education plans are designed to be flexible and can be applied to any phase of implementation: pilot, roll-out, upgrade or refresher. OpenText learning services employ a blended approach by combining mentoring, instructor-led courses, webinars, eLearning and focused workshops.
Marketing and Sales 
Customers
Our customer base consists of Global 10,000 organizations, enterprise companies, mid-market companies and public sector agencies. Historically, including in Fiscal 2019, no single customer has accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues.
Partners and Alliances
We are also committed to establishing relationships with the best resellers and technology and service providers to ensure customer success. Together as partners, we fulfill key market objectives to drive new business, establish a competitive advantage, and create demonstrable business value.
Our Global Partner Program enables us to focus on the core roots of our partnerships. The framework offers five distinct programs: Referral, Reseller, Services, Technology, and Support. This creates an extended organization to develop technologies, repeatable service offerings, and solutions that enhance the way our customers maximize their investment in our products and services. Through the Global Partner Program, we are extending market coverage, building stronger relationships, and providing customers with a more complete local ecosystem of partners to meet their needs. Each distinct program is focused to provide valuable business benefits to the joint relationship. A complete listing of our partners can be found on our website.
Our strategic partners include:

• | SAP SE (SAP): Our solutions help SAP customers improve the way they manage content in SAP systems in order to assist them to improve efficiency in key processes, manage compliance, or gain new insights.


• | Google Cloud: We work together with Google Cloud to deploy our EIM solutions on the Google Cloud Platform. This includes a containerized application architecture for flexible cloud or hybrid deployment models. Deploying our solutions on the Google Cloud Platform allows our customers to scale their deployments as their businesses demand. We also work with the Google Cloud engineering team to explore integrations with Google Analytics, G-Suite and other functions.


• | Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft): Our partnership enables organizations to connect all aspects of their content infrastructure and take advantage of their most valuable asset - information. This helps organizations to better scale operations with confidence and improve IT and developer efficiency - all with the aim of obtaining a lower total cost of ownership over competitive solutions.


• | Oracle Corporation (Oracle): We develop innovative solutions for Oracle applications that enhance the experience and productivity of users working with these tools.


• | Salesforce.com Corporation (Salesforce): The company-to-company partnership between OpenText and Salesforce is focused on continuing to grow a full portfolio of EIM solutions to complement the Salesforce ecosystem by uniting the structured and unstructured information experience.

Our main global systems integrators include, but are not limited to, Accenture plc, Deloitte Consulting LLP, Tata Consultancy Services, ATOS and Ernst & Young.
International Markets
We provide our product offerings worldwide. Our geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a geographically diverse workforce, providing greater stability to our operations and revenue streams by diversifying our portfolio to better mitigate against the risks of a single geographically focused business.
There are inherent risks to conducting operations internationally. For more information about these risks, see “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
The market for our products and services is highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change and shifting customer needs and economic pressures. We compete with multiple companies, some that have single or narrow solutions and some that have a range of information management solutions, like us. Our primary competitor is International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), with numerous other software vendors competing with us in the EIM sector, such as Veeva Systems Inc., j2 Global Inc., Pegasystems Inc., Hyland Software Inc., SPS Commerce Inc., Box Inc. and Adobe Systems Inc. In certain markets, OpenText competes with Oracle and Microsoft, who are also our partners. In addition, we also face competition from systems integrators that configure hardware and software into customized systems. Additionally, new competitors or alliances among existing competitors may emerge and could rapidly acquire additional market share. We also expect that competition will increase as a result of ongoing software industry consolidation.
We believe that certain competitive factors affect the market for our software products and services, which may include: (i) vendor and product reputation; (ii) product quality, performance and price; (iii) the availability of software products on multiple platforms; (iv) product scalability; (v) product integration with other enterprise applications; (vi) software functionality and features; (vii) software ease of use; (viii) the quality of professional services, customer support services and training; and (ix) the ability to address specific customer business problems. We believe the relative importance of each of these factors depends upon the concerns and needs of each specific customer.
Research and Development
The industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and competitive new products and features. As a result, our success, in part, depends on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products in a timely and efficient manner and to develop and introduce new products that meet customer needs while reducing total cost of ownership. To achieve these objectives, we have made and expect to continue to make investments in research and development, through internal and third-party development activities, third-party licensing agreements and potentially through technology acquisitions. Our R&D expenses were $321.8 million for Fiscal 2019, $322.9 million for Fiscal 2018, and $281.2 million for Fiscal 2017. We believe our spending on research and development is an appropriate balance between managing our organic growth and results of operations. We expect to continue to invest in R&D to maintain and improve our products and services offerings.
Acquisitions During the Last Five Fiscal Years
Our competitive position in the marketplace requires us to maintain a complex and evolving array of technologies, products, services and capabilities. In light of the continually evolving marketplace in which we operate, we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities within the EIM market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities.
Below is a summary of the more material acquisitions we have made over the last five fiscal years.
In Fiscal 2019, we completed the following acquisitions:

• | On January 31, 2019, we acquired Catalyst for approximately $70.8 million.


• | On December 17, 2018, we acquired Liaison for approximately $310.6 million.


 Prior to Fiscal 2019, we completed the following acquisitions:

• | On May 1, 2016, we acquired ANXe Business Corporation (ANX), a leading provider of cloud-based information exchange services to the automotive and healthcare industries, based in Michigan, United States. Total consideration for ANX was approximately $104.6 million.


• | On April 30, 2016, we acquired certain customer experience software and services assets and liabilities from HP Inc. (CEM Business) for approximately $160.0 million.


• | On November 23, 2015, we acquired Daegis Inc. (Daegis), a global information governance, data migration solutions and development company, based in Texas, United States. Total consideration for Daegis was approximately $23.3 million.


• | On January 16, 2015, we acquired Actuate Corporation (Actuate), based in San Francisco, California, United States, for $332.0 million, comprised of approximately $322.4 million in cash and shares we purchased of Actuate in the open market with a fair value of approximately $9.5 million as of the date of acquisition. Actuate was a leader in personalized analytics and insights.


• | On January 2, 2015, we acquired Informative Graphics Corporation (IGC), based in Scottsdale, Arizona, United States, for approximately $40.0 million. IGC was a leading developer of viewing, annotation, redaction and publishing commercial software.

We believe our acquisitions support our long-term strategy for growth, strengthen our competitive position, expand our customer base and provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our earnings and provide superior shareholder value. We expect to continue to strategically acquire companies, products, services and technologies to augment our existing business.
Intellectual Property Rights
Our success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to develop, protect and maintain our intellectual property and proprietary technology and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Our software products are generally licensed to our customers on a non-exclusive basis for internal use in a customer's organization. We also grant rights to our intellectual property to third parties that allow them to market certain of our products on a non-exclusive or limited-scope exclusive basis for a particular application of the product(s) or to a particular geographic area.
We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary rights. We have obtained or applied for trademark registration for most corporate and strategic product names in most major markets. We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending applications, including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions, which relate to various aspects of our products and technology. The duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and is typically 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent. From time to time, we may enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation in line with our strategic and business objectives. While we believe our intellectual property is valuable and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success, we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent, trademark, license, or other intellectual property right.
For more information on the risks related to our intellectual property rights, see "Risk Factors" included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Employees
As of June 30, 2019, we employed a total of approximately 13,100 individuals. The approximate composition of our employee base is as follows: (i) 2,100 employees in sales and marketing, (ii) 3,700 employees in product development, (iii) 3,100 employees in cloud services, (iv) 1,500 employees in professional services, (v) 1,100 employees in customer support, and (vi) 1,600 employees in general and administrative roles. We believe that relations with our employees are strong. None of our employees are represented by a labour union, nor do we have collective bargaining arrangements with any of our employees. However, in certain international jurisdictions in which we operate, a “Workers' Council” represents our employees.
