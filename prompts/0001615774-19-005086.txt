General 
 
Applied Energetics 2019 General Corporate Review:
 
Applied Energetics, is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our executive office is located at 2480 W Ruthrauff Road, Suite 140 Q, Tucson, Arizona, 85705;(520) 628-7415. www.aergs.com
 
Applied Energetics specializes in the development and manufacture of advanced high-performance lasers, high voltage electronics, advanced optical systems, and integrated guided energy systems for defense, aerospace, industrial, and scientific customers worldwide.
 
AE has developed, successfully demonstrated and holds all crucial ownership rights to a dynamic Directed Energy technology called Laser Guided Energy (“LGE”) and Laser Induced Plasma Channel (“LIPC”). LGE and LIPC are technologies that can be used in a new generation of high-tech weapons. In the market today, two key types of Directed Energy Weapon (“DEW”) technologies exist, High Energy Lasers (“HEL”), and High-Power Microwave (“HPM”). Neither HEL or HPM are owned by a single entity. Now, there is a third DEW technology, LGE. Applied Energetics’ LGE and LIPC technologies are owned by AE, and patent protected with 25 current patents and an additional 11 Government Sensitive Patent Applications (“GSPA”). The company’s GSPA’s are held under secrecy orders of the US government. That is important because government GSPA’s allow AE greatly extended protection rights.
 
AE’s technology is vastly different than conventional directed energy weapons, i.e. HEL, and HPM. LGE uses Ultra-Short Pulse (USP) laser technology to combine the speed and precision of lasers with the overwhelming punch of high-voltage electricity. This advanced “man-made lightning” allows extremely high peak power and energy, with target effects tenability, and is effective against a wide variety of potential targets. A key element of LGE is its novel ability to offer selectable and tunable properties that can help protect non-combatants and combat zone infrastructure.

As AE moves toward the future, our business strategy reflects upon the significant value of LGE and LIPC, and also includes related technologies involving Advanced Ultra Short-Pulse (“AUSP”) and Counter-IED (“CIED”) technologies. Consequently, AE has resumed long-term R&D of next generation advanced LGE, LIPC, USP, and potentially CIED technologies for national security and defense applications.
 
LETTER TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
 
Our Principal Executive Officer has prepared and issued the following letter to our shareholders:
 
Dear Shareholders:
 
On behalf of our management team, I would like to present this letter to shareholders of our company to explain details about important events in 2018 and in the execution of our business plan for 2019 and over the long term. 
 
2018 was a year of transition and great positive change for Applied Energetics Inc. (“AE”). On March 9, 2018, new management for AE was put in place with a victorious proxy by shareholders, removing the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and sole director with cause. Since that time, management has undertaken and completed a series of activities focusing on the reconstitution of the company and its advanced technologies, which include Laser Guided Energy (“LGE”), Laser Induced Plasma Channel (“LIPC”), Advanced Ultra Short-Pulse (“AUSP”) and Counter-IED (“CIED”). The Board of Directors and executive team have more recently executed a plan to address critical areas required to further establish a strong corporate and scientific foundation, create future growth and define the future strategic direction of the company.
 
AE Technology and Patents
 
AE has developed, successfully demonstrated and holds all crucial ownership rights to a dynamic Directed Energy technology called LGE and LIPC. LGE and LIPC are technologies that can be used in a new generation of high-tech weapons. In the market today, two key types of Directed Energy Weapon (“DEW”) technologies exist, High Energy Lasers (“HEL”), and High-Power Microwave (“HPM”). Neither HEL or HPM are owned by a single entity. Now, there is a third DEW technology, LGE. Applied Energetics’s LGE and LIPC technologies are owned by AE, and patent protected with 25 current patents and an additional 11 Government Sensitive Patent Applications (“GSPA”). The company’s GSPA’s are held under secrecy orders of the US government. That is important because government GSPA’s allow AE greatly extended protection rights.
 
AE’s technology is vastly different from conventional directed energy weapons, i.e. HEL, and HPM. LGE uses Ultra-Short Pulse (USP) technology to combine the speed and precision of lasers with the overwhelming punch of high-voltage electricity. This advanced “man-made lightning” allows extremely high peak power and energy, with target effects tenability, and is effective against a wide variety of potential targets. A key element of LGE is its novel ability to offer selectable and tunable properties that can help protect non-combatants and combat zone infrastructure.
 
As AE moves toward the future, our business strategy reflects upon the significant value of LGE and LIPC, and also includes related technologies involving AUSP and CIED technologies.
 
AE’s immediate priorities going forward include the following:
 

A. | Support R&D efforts: LGE and LIPC are rapidly expanding technologies and the cornerstone to AE’s future, along with unique projects involving AUSP opportunities and counter-IED. These will be the key areas of R&D for 2019. AE’s LGE, LIPC and AUSP technologies potentially have many significant new opportunities in a variety of rapidly evolving areas. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


B. | Focus on Business Development: In July 2018, AE launched a targeted business development effort to engage both the US government and existing teaming partners and help communicate the value of AE’s intellectual property and corporate capabilities. The company has engaged Westpark Advisors, LLC as a full-time consultant specifically assigned to this effort in the Virginia and Washington D.C. area. To date, Westpark’s efforts have produced requests for information and many important introductions to potential AE customers. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


C. | Build a Solid Executive Management Team: AE is currently seeking to appoint a permanent CEO with highly specialized skills and experience in the field of lasers and optical physics to further AE’s rapidly growing and opportunistic technology portfolio and to manage its corporate and scientific affairs. Management has been in discussions concerning this important matter and expects to announce a new CEO before the end of the second quarter of 2019. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D. | Assemble a Highly Specialized Scientific Team: AE’s lead scientist, Dr. Stephen McCahon is a cofounder of Applied Energetics and is highly accomplished in the field of laser technology and recognized in the scientific community. Dr. McCahon is currently in the process of assembling a highly specialized AE scientific team to further optimize areas of the company’s targeted growth. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


E. | Expand the Board of Directors: To help facilitate AE’s expected future corporate growth, the Board of Directors is expected to expand from 3 to 5 directors. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


F. | Opportunities Through M&A: AE’s management and Board of Directors intends to pursue strategic corporate acquisitions in related fields and technology. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


G. | Funding for Future Growth: AE is currently pursuing several avenues to bring institutional sponsorship to help fund the next two years of corporate and R&D growth. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As we move forward in 2019 and beyond, management believes AE’s advanced technology business opportunities have never been greater. We recently attended the February 2019 Booz Allen Directed Energy Conference in Washington D.C. During presentations and in discussions concerning Directed Energy, a presenter commented that, “stakeholders attending the summit used to prognosticate that directed energy technology would be deployed to the field in the next “five to 10 years,” but thanks to increased federal spending, that number may be down to two or three years. We are right on the cusp of fielding developmental systems that can quickly transition to operational capabilities”. (www.boozallen.com/d/event/directed-energy-summit.html)
 
Through our analysis of the market, and in discussions with potential customers, we would also conclude that customers are becoming more receptive and interested in directed energy technologies. According to the Department of Defense (“DOD”), directed energy spending by the DOD is expected to grow from approximately $500 million in 2018 to over $1 billion in 2019, an increase of 100% year over year. As a result, we continue to be evermore excited about our future and the growing opportunities in directed energy applications. With our existing patent portfolio, and through further advancements of our technologies, we believe there is an opportunity for us to become a leading and successful developer in the marketplace. Finally, with our team of dedicated professionals and ambitious scientists, along with a supportive shareholder base, we also believe that the future and timing of the company has never been better than it is today. We look forward to a successful year.
 
Sincerely, 
 
Brad Adamczyk

Applied Energetics 2018 Accomplishments and News of Importance
 

● | On March 8, 2018 a group of AE investors led by original cofounder and previous CEO Thomas C. Dearmin, along with Jonathon Barcklow, Brad Adamczyk, John Schultz and Oak Tree Asset Management Ltd. were victorious in a proxy vote, removing with cause George Farley, the Chief Executive Officer, and sole director of the company. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On March 9, 2018 a new three-man board of directors took office and appointed Thomas C. Dearmin acting CEO. The company’s first line of business was to review all aspects of the company’s business and to create a check list of issues in order of priority. It became immediately apparent that the new management had to address egregious and highly toxic loans put on the company books by the company’s former CEO and sole director over the prior six months. Because of timing constraints and lack of cash, board members Barcklow and Adamczyk agreed to loan the company interest free the needed funds to take care of immediate corporate needs. At the top of the list were the toxic loans set to convert into shares within days. Shortly thereafter, on April 12, 2018, the company commenced raising funds via the private placement of restricted shares of AE at .06 cents per share. By May of 2018, all loans had been repaid, but at a substantial cost to the company. Adamczyk and Barcklow then converted their interest free loans to equity at .06 per share along with the equity subscription offering.
