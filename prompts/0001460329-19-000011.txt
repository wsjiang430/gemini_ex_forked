Item 1. Business.
This business description should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “2018 Form 10-K”), which are incorporated herein by this reference.
Company Overview
Fluent, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Fluent,” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation formerly known as Cogint, Inc., is an industry leader in data-driven digital marketing services. We primarily perform customer acquisition services by operating highly-scalable digital marketing campaigns, through which we connect our advertiser clients with consumers they are seeking to reach. We deliver data and performance-based marketing executions to our clients, which in 2018 included over 500 consumer brands, direct marketers and agencies across a wide range of industries, including Financial Services, Retail & Consumer, Media & Entertainment, Staffing & Recruitment and Marketing Services. 
We attract consumers at scale to our owned digital media properties primarily through promotional offerings and employment opportunities. On average, our websites receive over 900,000 first-party user registrations daily, which include users’ names, contact information and opt-in permission to present them with offers on behalf of our clients. According to comScore, we reach 12% of the U.S. digital population on a monthly basis through our owned media properties. Approximately 90% of these users engage with our media on their mobile devices or tablets. Our always-on, real-time capabilities enable users to access our media whenever and wherever they choose.
Once users have registered with our sites, we integrate proprietary direct marketing technologies to engage them with surveys, polls and other experiences, through which we learn about their lifestyles, preferences and purchasing histories. Based on these insights, we serve targeted, relevant offers to them on behalf of our clients. As new users register and engage with our sites and existing registrants re-engage, we believe the enrichment of our database enables expansion of our addressable client base and improves the effectiveness of our performance-based campaigns.
Since our inception, we have amassed a large, proprietary database of first-party, self-declared user information and preferences. We have permission to contact the majority of users in our database through multiple channels, such as email, home address, telephone, push notifications and SMS text messaging. We leverage our data primarily to serve advertisements that we believe will be relevant to users based on the information they have provided. We have also begun to leverage our existing database into new revenue streams, including utilization-based models, such as programmatic advertising and identity resolution, as well as services-based models, such as marketing research and insights.
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded revenue of $250.3 million and $211.7 million, net income from continuing operations of $3.2 million and net loss from continuing operations of $31.7 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $44.1 million and $32.5 million, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure based on US GAAP, adding back income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, and other adjustments. See our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto appearing elsewhere in the 2018 Form 10-K, and for further discussion and analysis of our results of operations, including a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA from net income (loss) from continuing operations, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Market Opportunity
According to eMarketer, aggregate spending on digital media is expected to overtake aggregate spending on offline media in the U.S. for the first time in 2019. Industry spending on digital media is projected by eMarketer to exceed $129 billion in 2019, representing approximately 54% of total media spend in the U.S. Of this total media spend, the largest component is expected to represent media spend on mobile platforms, which is also anticipated to represent the fastest growing segment of U.S. media spend over the five years from 2018 through 2022, according to eMarketer. Further, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau (“IAB”), performance-based advertising is the predominant industry pricing model, accounting for 61% of total U.S. digital advertising spending in the first half of 2018.
According to the IAB, marketers spent over $19 billion on data and related services and solutions in 2018 in the U.S., with the amount spent on digital data up approximately 37% over 2017 and exceeding, for the first time, amounts spent on traditional

terrestrial data. Further, marketers are increasing their focus and spend on recognizing consumer identities and tracking consumer behaviors across channels and devices, rather than simply targeting their advertising based on anonymized online behaviors.
Key Challenges Facing our Clients
While performance-based pricing models dominate digital media spend, we believe that a significant portion of such spend represents an intermediary step in an advertiser’s process of securing new customers, such as a click on a banner advertisement. According to The Nielsen CMO Report, only one in four marketers reports a high level of confidence in their ability to measure the return on investment, or ROI, of their media spend. We believe advertisers are operating in an environment where greater accountability is being mandated and, therefore, are becoming increasingly focused on the ability to precisely measure return on their media spend. 
In addition, many companies seeking to learn more about their existing customers or target new customers either gather data themselves or purchase data to inform their advertising and marketing strategies. However, the data they obtain is typically either not first-party, not sufficiently recent or not sufficiently complete. Moreover, these companies may not have the ability to capture real-time signals that are indicated by a consumer’s behavior, even if it is observable. As a result, we believe many companies who offer products and services to consumers do not have ready access to accurate consumer data or timely alerts through which they could programmatically target their advertising, nor the ability to resolve data sets and thereby confirm consumer identities or enrich data profiles.
Our Offerings and Solutions
We often provide performance marketing solutions to our clients based on their desired outcomes, or specific actions in their marketing funnels, including submission of a registration form, app installation or a completed transaction. As such, we believe our solutions are well-aligned with the needs and objectives of our clients, providing measurability, scalability and flexibility. In addition, by using the data consumers provide about themselves when registering on our sites, our advertiser clients are able to reach the precise audiences they are targeting through the modes of contact these consumers prefer and at the times they are most receptive to being contacted.
Performance Campaigns
For clients who seek the completion of certain actions by consumers, such as the submission of a registration form, the installation of a mobile application or a trial subscription of a good or service, we provide performance campaigns that meet the criteria specified by the client.
We bear the cost and risk of paying various media sources to generate consumer traffic to our digital media properties or to media properties owned or operated by our clients, without the assurance of a subsequent revenue-generating event from such activity. By leveraging our scale and expertise in acquiring consumer traffic, we effectively and efficiently enable our clients to define billable events and pricing tolerances that meet their profitability objectives, which may be difficult for them to achieve themselves economically, if at all.
Consumer Data 
For clients who prefer to contact consumers through means such as direct mail, email, telephone and other channels by which they can operate or manage a campaign, we generally transmit contact information for consumers who meet certain qualifications dictated by the client. We generate revenue through the delivery of qualifying data and through certain performance-based triggers that may be met based upon the client’s subsequent efforts to contact and market to such consumers.
The data records we provide contain varying depths of user profiles, ranging from basic contact information to in-depth self-declared preferences and behaviors. We believe the scale and depth of first-party, self-declared information captured in our database and reflected in our data profiles is a competitive advantage in the industry. Many other providers of consumer data offer data or information that is inferred from a consumer’s behavior but not directly observed or stated by such a consumer. We believe our first-party data is more reliable and reflective of consumers' current interests and preferences.

Emerging Data Offerings
In 2018, we began to offer data sets pertaining to certain audience segments from our database in programmatic environments, thereby enabling advertisers, such as those in the healthcare industry, to leverage our data in an anonymized, privacy-minded manner to target high-intent prospects for their offerings. While this offering is still nascent, we believe the results achieved to date indicate the commercial viability of this incremental revenue stream for our existing database.
We have also begun to develop an offering through which clients that possess their own first-party databases can resolve them against our first-party data, in an effort to cleanse and enrich their data sets, as well as allow for the deployment of loyalty and retention programs, thereby enhancing and extending the lifetime value of their customer relationships.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe our competitive strengths will continue to enable us to provide a compelling value proposition to our clients and drive differentiation of our offerings in the marketplace.
Scale and Ingenuity in Purchasing Media - Our ability to effectively access, at scale, channels and sources of media that supply consumer traffic to our media properties has been critical to our growth. Through hundreds of millions of dollars of media spend since our inception, we have gained knowledge and experience that we believe enable us to generate higher levels of profitability from given media sources, thereby enabling us to acquire media more competitively than others. This capability allows us to run thousands of campaigns simultaneously and cost-effectively for our clients at acceptable media costs and margins to us.
Proprietary and Innovative Technology Platform - We believe our internally-developed technology platform is unique in the industry, having been purpose-built for performance marketing and developed with a mobile-first user experience in mind since our founding in 2010. Our platform deploys proprietary machine-learning capabilities to build upon our experience with various promotional offers, consumer segments and advertisers, through which we continuously optimize our digital marketing campaigns.
Unique and Extensive Database of First-Party Consumer Information - We attract a substantial volume of consumers to our owned media properties on a daily basis and collect significant demographic, behavioral and other data as they engage with our direct marketing experiences. This data is utilized in real-time, as consumers respond to dynamically-populated survey questions, thereby enabling intelligently targeted ads to be served in response. This data is also stored and analyzed and can be further enhanced as consumers return to our sites and declare and exhibit additional preferences and behaviors through additional surveying, allowing for the development of deeper insights and additional monetization opportunities.
Sales and Marketing
We generate new sales primarily through our in-house sales team and we service established clients through our in-house account managers, who seek to optimize results for and expand our business with these clients.
Our Competition
Our traditional competitors have been digital marketing and database marketing services providers, online and traditional media companies, and advertising agencies. We believe the competitive landscape is changing and becoming more complex. We believe our data and our ad serving and customer acquisition technologies enable our clients to better target, engage, qualify and communicate with relevant consumers, in a more profitable manner, across web and in-app environments than our competitors.
Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources, better name recognition and a larger customer base. 
Concentration
We have an extensive list of clients across a wide range of industries. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was no individual advertiser that accounted for more than 10% of the consolidated revenue or accounts receivable, net of the Company.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was no individual third-party publisher through which we generated more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenue.
Corporate History
On March 20, 2015, the entity now known as Fluent, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware under the name Tiger Media, Inc. On April 30, 2015, Tiger Media, Inc. changed its name to IDI, Inc.
On December 9, 2015, IDI, Inc. completed the acquisition of Fluent, Inc., which merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary of IDI, Inc. and continued as the surviving company under the name Fluent, LLC. IDI, Inc. changed its name to Cogint, Inc. on September 26, 2016.
On March 26, 2018, Cogint, Inc. completed a spin-off (the "Spin-off") of its risk management business by way of a pro rata distribution of all the shares of common stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Red Violet, Inc. ("Red Violet"), to its stockholders of record as of March 19, 2018 (the "Record Date") and certain warrant holders.
Following the Spin-off, Cogint, Inc.’s common stock continued trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ"), and Red Violet became an independent public company, which owns all of the subsidiaries that previously operated Cogint Inc.'s risk management business.
On April 16, 2018, Cogint, Inc. changed its name to Fluent, Inc., and its common stock continued trading on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "FLNT."
Our Intellectual Property
We rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law, confidentiality agreements, and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. We have filed a patent application on our ad serving and lead generation system and also avail ourselves of applicable trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our proprietary technology. With respect to our trademarks, we maintain a portfolio of perpetual common law and federally-registered trademark rights across several brands and domains relating to our business units, products, services and solutions. We claim copyright protection in our original content that is published on our websites and included in our marketing materials. 
Regulatory Matters
Our business is subject to a significant number of federal, state, local and international laws, rules and regulations applicable to online advertising, commercial email marketing, telemarketing and text messaging, including, the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”), the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), the General Data Privacy Regulation (the “GDPR”), the Do Not Call Implementation Act, the CAN SPAM Act of 2003 (“CAN-SPAM  Act”), the Telemarketing Sales Rule (“TSR”), the California Business & Professions Code § 17529 (the “California Anti- Spam Act”) and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). We are also subject to laws, rules and regulations regarding data collection, privacy and data security, sweepstakes and promotions, intellectual property ownership and infringement, and taxation, among others. Some of our clients operate in regulated industries, such as financial services, credit repair, healthcare and medical services and secondary education, and, to the extent applicable, we must comply with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to marketing activities in those industries.
These laws, rules and regulations, which generally are designed to prevent deceptive practices in advertising, online marketing and telemarketing, protect individual privacy rights and prevent the misuse and unauthorized disclosure of personal information, are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws, rules and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate.
Our Employees
We had 174 employees as of December 31, 2018, of which 170 were full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization, and none are party to any collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we believe we have an excellent relationship with our employees. Competition in the recruiting of personnel in our industry is intense. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire, motivate and retain qualified sales and marketing, executive and administrative and technical personnel. To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining qualified employees.
