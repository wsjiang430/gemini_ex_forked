ITEM 1. | DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 
--------+------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on June 25, 2002. We operate in two separate business segments; cold weather clothing and a house wrap for the building construction industry. Both of our segment lines use products made from INSULTEX, which is a low density foamed polyethylene with buoyancy, scent block, and thermal resistant properties. We have a license agreement directly with the owner of the INSULTEX Technology. In December 2015, we took delivery of equipment capable of producing INSULTEX. Given the time and cost of bringing the equipment into production mode and our current financial condition, it is our current intention to attempt to sell the equipment. We will continue to operate under the license agreement for the manufacture of INSULTEX used in our cold weather clothing.
 
Other companies are free to purchase INSULTEX from us assuming that it is a company within the distribution jurisdiction that we have, which is worldwide with the exception of Korea and Japan. Other than Korea and Japan, we are the sole worldwide supplier/distributor of the INSULTEX material.
 
We offer the following products containing INSULTEX:
 

• | Floating Swimwear: Product under our product name "Swimeez". Our swimwear is designed to be a swim aid. The interior lining of our swimwear product is made from INSULTEX, which enhances floatability. This product was discontinued during 2010 and we are only selling from our existing inventory. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hunting Apparel Line: Our hunting apparel provides almost total block from odors provided by the INSULTEX material. This product was discontinued during 2010 and we are only selling from our existing inventory. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Arctic Armor Line: The Arctic Armor line, introduced in April of 2006, consists of a jacket, bib and gloves. The suit contains 3 layers of INSULTEX for uncompromised warmth and provides the user with guaranteed buoyancy. The gloves contain a single layer of INSULTEX and are windproof, waterproof and good to sub-zero temperatures as are the jacket and bibs. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | INSULTEX House Wrap: Our house wrap product is designed for the building construction industry. This product, made from INSULTEX, provides barrier protection plus moisture vapor transmission and approximately R-3 and R-6 value insulation. We also sell a tape that is designed to be used with the INSULTEX House Wrap. In December 2016, we temporarily suspended any advertising of our House Wrap product line. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | INSULTEX Material: We sell INSULTEX material in bulk to non-competing customers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also offer a product that helps restore the waterproof character of the outer side of our Arctic Armor clothing. In addition, we offer cold weather headgear and a base insulation clothing product.

Our apparel products containing INSULTEX are manufactured, under agreement, at a facility we currently utilize in Indonesia. We assumed no material costs associated with the design, prototyping, and testing of these products because: (a) we did not utilize the services of any outside consultant or company for these purposes and (b) although we used the services of our Chief Executive Officer and Vice President of Sales and Marketing for these purposes, their efforts are part of their normal responsibilities. Our INSULTEX House Wrap product is manufactured in the United States through a third-party manufacturer.
 
For financial information regarding each segment, please see Note 9 of the Notes to Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Report.
 
The INSULTEX License and Manufacturing Agreement
 
Under the terms of the agreement between us and the Ketut Group, Ketut Group agrees to promptly deliver to Innovative Designs, Inc. within twenty-eight (28) days of receiving an order, all INSULTEX ordered by us. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to pay a fixed amount per meter of INSULTEX. This fixed amount will not change under the agreement for a period of ten (10) years after the date of the agreement was signed, which was April 1, 2006. The agreement provides that after the ten (10) year period, the price of the INSULTEX shall be adjusted for a subsequent ten (10) year term, no more than twelve percent (12%) for the subsequent ten (10) year period. We order INSULTEX from time to time as needed and are not required to purchase any minimum amount of INSULTEX during the term of the agreement, and we are not required to make any minimum annual payment. However, should we place an order; any quantity ordered must be a minimum of 100,000 yards of INSULTEX. We are not required to pay any part of any sublicense fee that we receive from third party sub-licensees, and we are not required to pay any fees to the Ketut Group. This agreement will be in full legal force and effect for an initial term of ten (10) years from the date of its execution. We have the option to renew this agreement for up to three (3) successive terms of ten (10) years each by giving notice of our intention to so renew not less than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the then-current term. The Company has exercised the first ten-year renewal option. We purchased the equipment capable of producing INSULTEX from the Ketut Group.

Website and Retailers
 
We sell both wholesale and retail products on our web site. Our web site, located at www.idigear.com, contains information on our products, technical information on INSULTEX insulation, e-commerce capabilities with "shopping cart", wholesaler information and order forms, company contact information, and links to retailers that carry our products. We have obtained the services of BA Web Productions who assists us in designing and continually developing our website. Our web site features a "wholesaler only" area, allowing our wholesalers access to information, ordering, and reordering. Our products are offered and sold by retailers, distributors and through our web site in all states and Canada. Except for products sold through our web site, others who purchase our products do so at wholesale prices which they plan to sell at their retail prices or use within their industry.
Sales
 
We primarily sell our products through independent sales agents and agencies. Once we have made contact with a potential sales agency or solo agent, we evaluate their existing accounts, the capacity and potential for them to effectively push our products. We also look at their current product lines through the sales channel. Our primary market area is the outdoor industry which includes all activity done in cold weather. These activities include recreational such as hunting, ice fishing, snowmobiling, and industries such as oil and gas, utilities and construction. Once we agree to bring on an independent sales agent or agency, we enter into a standard agreement.
 
A typical sales representative agreement will have a term of one year with the right of either party to terminate upon thirty days written notice. We do not provide any free samples of our products and all sales expenses are the sole obligation of the sales agent.
 
Certain retailers buy directly from us. We have no verbal or written agreements with them. These retailers purchase our products strictly on a purchase order basis. During our last fiscal year, we sold our products to such retailers as Canadian Tire and Dick’s Sporting Goods. Some of our distributors during the last fiscal year were Triple S Pro Fishing Supplies and Fleece Corner. We distribute our products to the following:
 
Swimeez Products
 
We distribute our Swimeez products through our web site.
 
Hunting Apparel Line
 
We distribute our hunting apparel through our web site.
 
Our hunting apparel consists of a six pocket pants, 1/2 zip pullover jacket with collar, parka jacket, fleece jacket, bib coveralls in light weight, and bib coveralls in arctic weight.

Arctic Armor Line
 
We distribute the Arctic Armor Line to retailers and distributors across the United States and Canada. These products are also marketed to utility companies, oil/gas pipeline workers, railroad workers, police and first responders, and to construction workers.
 
During our last fiscal year, two customers accounted for more than ten percent of our cold weather clothing products sales, Fleece Corner (27.1%) and Pro Fishing Supplies (14.5%).
 
HOUSE WRAP
 
House Wrap
 
In early January 2008, we announced that we had completed our research and development effort on a new use for INSULTEX as a house wrap for the building construction industry. This house wrap provides barrier protection plus moisture vapor transmission and the feature of approximately R-3 and R-6 value insulation. The INSULTEX House Wrap was designed to specifically add enhanced insulating characteristics. In addition, the house wrap is priced competitively with existing house wraps that do not provide any insulation. The development efforts were conducted by our own personnel and an outside consultant. In December 2016, we temporarily suspended any advertising for our House Wrap product line as we are currently in litigation with the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). Please see “Legal Proceedings” appearing elsewhere in this report.
INSULTEX House Wrap
 
During our last fiscal year three customers accounted for more than ten percent of our total sales of our House Wrap product, A-Team Building Supplies, LLC (38.7%), Well Done Insulation (31.1%), and Eddie’s Ace Hardware (13.2%).
Competition
 
Many companies offer a type of house wrap some with insulating properties. These companies have large operations and are well financed. Some of the larger companies are DuPont, Owens-Corning and Kimberly Clark. The Company expects to face intense competition with others who have much greater resources in the building construction supply industry.

We ship wholesale product orders by United Parcel Service or trucking companies. Retail orders from our website are shipped United Parcel Ground Service or Federal Express overnight. The costs of shipping our finished goods are paid by our customers. We have not instituted any formal arrangements or agreements with United Parcel Service, Federal Express or trucking companies, and we do not intend to do so.
 
INSULTEX is used in all our Arctic Armor finished goods, except for our headwear, and is purchased directly from the Ketut Group.
 
All of our cold weather clothing products, except for our gloves, which are purchased from a supplier in the U.S., are sub-manufactured by PT Lidya and Natalia located in Indonesia.

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We contact our sub-manufacturers with the details of the order, including the number of units to be produced according to design or model, size, or color. The sub-manufacturer procures all materials required for the product. Our House Wrap inventory is stored in the facility that manufactures it. We use a commercially available breathable water repellant film used in the manufacturing process that we store at the seller’s facility.

In 2007, we were granted the mark "INSULTEX" by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
 In 2011, we were granted a trademark for “INSULTEX HOUSE WRAP” by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
 In December 2009, we filed a patent application, No. 12 642714, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for our Composite House Wrap. The application is still pending. In order to obtain the broadest possible patent protection for this invention Innovative Designs, Inc. has appealed a portion of the decision of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) entered in Appeal 2015-006289 to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) under 35 U.S.C. §141. The portion of the decision of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) entered in Appeal 2015-006289 reversing the examiner’s rejection has not been appealed. Innovative Designs, Inc. expects a favorable action allowing for the broadest possible patent protection to be obtained.
 We had filed a provisional application in December 2008. The patent is currently held by our Chief Executive Officer and a consultant to the Company.
 In February of 2010, our Chief Executive Officer filed a patent application for a composite fabric material and apparel made therefrom. The patent has been allowed. The patent has been assigned to the Company.
 In May 2016, our Chief Executive Officer and a consultant to the Compliant filed a patent application relating to INSULTEX entitled “Process for Forming Closed Cell Expanded Low Density Polyethylene Foam and Products Formed Thereby”.
 Our production costs are limited to the invoices we receive from our sub-manufacturer, PT Lidya and Natalia, on a per production basis and for our gloves from our supplier in the U.S and for our House Wrap product from the manufacturer.
 Although we are not aware of the need for any government approval of our principal products, we may be subject to such approvals in the future.
 United States and foreign regulations may subject us to increased regulation costs, and possibly fines or restrictions on conducting our business. We are subject, directly or indirectly, to governmental regulations pertaining to the following government agencies:
 United States Customs Service
 We are required to pay a 6.5% importation duty to the United States Customs Service on all imported products. We import INSULTEX from Indonesia from the Ketut Group, in accordance with Innovative Design’s agreement with the Ketut Group.
United States Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration
 Because our sub-manufacturers manufacture our completed products, we and our sub-manufacturers will be subject to the regulations of the United States Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

We are not aware of any governmental regulations that will affect the Internet aspects of our business. However, due to increasing usage of the Internet, a number of laws and regulations may be adopted relating to the Internet covering user privacy, pricing, and characteristics and quality of products and services. Furthermore, the growth and development of Internet commerce may prompt more stringent consumer protection laws imposing additional burdens on those companies conducting business over the Internet. The adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the Internet, which, in turn, could decrease the demand for Internet services and increase the cost of doing business on the Internet. These factors may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
 Moreover, the interpretation of sales tax, libel, and personal privacy laws applied to Internet commerce is uncertain and unresolved. We may be required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each such state or foreign country. Our failure to qualify as a foreign corporation in a jurisdiction where we are required to do so could subject us to taxes and penalties. Any such existing or new legislation or regulation, including state sales tax, or the application of laws or regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 We currently have no costs associated with compliance with environmental regulations. Because we do not manufacture our products, but rather they are manufactured by our sub-manufacturers, we do not anticipate any costs associated with environmental compliance. Moreover, the delivery and distribution of our products will not involve substantial discharge of environmental pollutants. However, there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in the future.
 We estimate that all of our revenues will be from the sale of our products. We will sell our products at prices above our original cost to produce our products. Prices for some of our products will be lower than similar products of our competitors, while others will be higher. We expect our product prices to be lower than network marketing companies, but higher compared with retail establishments that directly manufacture their own products.
 Products that are sold directly by our website will be priced according to our Manufacturer Suggested Retail Prices. Our wholesale clients will purchase our products at our wholesale prices. We recommend that our retailer clients sell our products at the Manufacturer Suggested Retail Prices that we provide to them which are the same prices for products on our website; however, they are not required to do so and may price our products for retail sale at their discretion. We have established M.A.P. (minimum advertised pricing) on our Arctic Armor™ suit in an attempt to allow all retailers and distributors carrying the line to obtain reasonable gross margin dollars.
 We currently have a total of 3 full time employees. We hire part-time personnel as needed.
 We have no collective bargaining or employment agreements.
