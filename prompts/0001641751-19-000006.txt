Company Overview
 
Vet Online Supply, Inc. is an emerging growth company that now engages in the online sale of its own holistic product line for pets, during the first quarter of 2018, the Company discontinued its legacy veterinarian supplies lines. These new holistic pet products are designed to help with arthritis, compromised immune systems, stress responses, aggression and digestive issues and may also be useful in treating acute ailments like sprains and strains, torn ligaments, bone breaks and even during post-operative care to reduce swelling, pain and stiffness. The Companys web-based eCommerce platform with our products is on our website www.vetonlinesupplies.com.

Vet online Supply Inc. is a manufacturer of holistic pet products that include treats, oils and oral sprays. Distribution channels include online retail sales and fulfillment, direct sales and sub-distributors. Although selling pet products online is not entirely new, we anticipate that this medium will continue to grow as the popularity of Internet eCommerce continues to grow.

We hope to realize our full plan of operations by raising additional capital through the sale of our securities, and other financing strategies to fully implement our marketing plan. While we have designed a full marketing strategy to gain brand awareness, with a goal of developing a large opt-in customer base we have not yet raised sufficient capital to implement this strategy.
 
Our Market Opportunity
 
We have formed our initial marketing and business model. According to the American Pet Products Association (APPA), revenue in the pet industry was $66.75 billion in 2016, an increase of more than 4% over 2015. The average annual growth rate since 2002 is 5.4%, and revenue has been growing steadily for well over 20 years. Of the $66.75 billion in revenue in 2016, $14.71 billion was spent on pet health supplies and medicine. The forecast for 2017 was $14.93 billion. Manufacturers level pet health product demand is forecast to increase 4.6 percent annually to $5.6 billion that year. Advances in expenditures will be encouraged by continuing trend of humanizing companion animals and their perception as family members, as well as by growth in the overall pet population. Veterinary technology will continue to adapt diagnostic and treatment techniques from human health care, stimulating value gains for newer, more costly procedures.

As todays world moves toward online eCommerce solutions, we believe pet owners will be hard pressed to ignore the cost and quality benefit of online ordering.
 
Industry Overview
 
Having holistic pet products available for sale online opens the door to every individual (who has access to the Internet) to have access to our products. Our website does not require a special account, or a qualification process. An account can be made if the user so chooses. Compared to a representative sales force that travels, there is a lower cost to reach an unlimited number of customers across the USA and world using the Internet; travel costs of representatives are eliminated. There is no time lag between the offering of a new product, and its availability online. Email blasts allow the companies to maintain constant, inexpensive communication with their customers, and to provide specials and discounts that motivate purchasing.
Current Operations
 
Since inception, our operations have primarily consisted of the organization of our business and the development of our business plan. To date we have experienced limited sales from our eCommerce platform launched in fiscal 2014 as we have not yet been available to fully implement our marketing strategy to expand our sales due to lack of available funds.
Products
 
Vet Online Supply for Animals
 
Our company manufactures holistic products using hemp oil or hemp isolate that includes Pet Treats and Pet Drops for cats and dogs. The company manufactures its products through LBC Bioscience in Phoenix, Arizona with certifications with SC Laboratories in Santa Cruz, California.
 
We offer our products on our website. We hope to provide clients with a competitive cost, quality product. Individuals will be able to order online 24/7, from our website, with a minimum order of $100. Our products offered on our site will enjoy the benefit of eCommerce, compared to companies providing products using catalogue options, thus reducing costs, as the sale of products through us will not include catalogue design fees, printing fees, or any postage costs.
 
It is our hope that our eCommerce website will attract new customers with the ability to go to our website and create an account at no cost and order supplies as needed any hour of the day any day of the week.

Marketing
 
We have engaged various marketing tools and consultants to for social media, press releases and website advertising. Warm Media, LLC in Bend, Oregon provides all website media advertising and marketing. Meridian Ventures, LLC provides news releases.
Growth Strategy
 
Initially, our target customers have been predominantly pet owners within the large cities of the United States. As we are able to implement our full marketing strategy and grow our client and end-user base, we hope to gain the attention of the general public as well. However, until such time as we have begun substantive marketing efforts we will not be able to adequately assess what portions of our strategy for growth will be most appropriate. However, we envision our success being attributable to our ability to:

- | attract new clients with our competitive costs and quality products, and by providing customers with a free, login account to manage all orders.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | sustain lower operating costs per customer compared to other companies by having all marketing and materials Internet based.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | deploy our capital more effectively by hiring a successful firm that specializes in the search engine optimization and social media marketing of eCommerce websites.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Competition
 
We compete for the sales of pet products with existing websites that sell similar products. Our principal competitors include but are not limited to: Petco; MWI Veterinary Supply; California Veterinary Supply; Lampert Vet Supply; Valley Vet Supply; and Miller Vet Supply, all of which offer online products. Numerous other second tier resellers are also in the marketplace.
 
Most, if not all, of our competitors have greater name and brand recognition and access to greater amounts of capital and established relationships with a larger base of current and potential customers. Because of their size and bargaining power, our competitors may be able to purchase supplies and products at lower prices than us in the initial stages of our development. As a result, our operations may be significantly and negatively impacted by our larger, more established competitors. In particular, once we are able to fund our full marketing program, if we are not able to generate enough revenue by attracting new and businesses and/or by enticing our customers to buy our products, we may be forced to cease operations.
 
Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on the quality of our products, size of our database of customers, as well as our marketing efforts and our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry. These factors include the introduction of new products and technologies, changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends, economic conditions, and pricing strategies of competitors. As a result of competition, we may be required to:
 

● | increase overall spending to ensure we are offering the best quality products and pricing to our customers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | continually assess and evaluate our specials and other offers to ensure that we are offering the most compelling and affordable products
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increase our advertising, promotional spending, commissions and other customer acquisition costs.
