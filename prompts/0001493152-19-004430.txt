Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Reed’s Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Reed’s”, the “Company,” “we,” or “us” throughout this report) owns a leading portfolio of handcrafted, all-natural beverages that is sold in over 30,000 outlets nationwide (including the natural and specialty food channel, grocery stores, mass merchants, drug stores, convenience stores, club stores and on-premise locations including bars and restaurants). Reed’s two core brands are Reed’s Craft Ginger Beer and Virgil’s Handcrafted soda. Reed’s Craft Ginger Beers are unique due to the proprietary process of using fresh ginger root combined with a Jamaican inspired recipe of natural spices, honey and fruit juices. Reed’s uses this same handcrafted approach in its Virgil’s line of great tasting, bold flavored craft sodas, including its award winning Virgil’s Root Beer.
 
Reed’s is the leading ginger beer in the US; Virgil’s is the leading independent (not aligned with Coca-Cola or Keurig Dr. Pepper) all-natural full line craft soda and is ranked fourth in the craft soda category as a whole.
 
Recent Business Optimization
 
In 2017, Reed’s newly hand-picked executive management team developed and launched a plan to capture performance improvements, re-accelerate core brand growth, and become a premier “asset-light” sales and marketing organization.

Beginning in June of 2017, pursuant to our plan, we successfully:
 

● | Optimized our business model through the sale of our manufacturing and bottling facility in Los Angeles. As a result, we have been relieved of annual lease payments of approximately $420,000, idle plant costs which aggregated $2,428,000 in 2018, and the need for significant continuing capital expenditures; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | negotiated new strategic co-packing partnerships on both coasts for both bottles and cans; 
● | completed the relocation of our headquarters to Norwalk, Connecticut and added upgraded leadership talent across all functions including sales, marketing, supply chain, finance and accounting; 
● | streamlined our portfolio to focus on the approximately thirty-five SKUs that together accounted for approximately 83% of 2018 gross revenue; 
● | restructured our selling prices to offset several years of raw material price increases; 
● | negotiated improved raw material vendor contracts; 
● | entered into a new long-term glass supply agreement significantly improving gross margins; 
● | enhanced our capital structure, including entering into a new credit facility with Rosenthal & Rosenthal that improved terms, reduced debt-service requirements by approximately $1.5 million on an annualized basis, and increased flexibility to support Reed’s future growth needs; 
● | increased investment and expanded capabilities in sales and marketing, including development of a marketing function; secured partnerships with new creative, public relations and marketing support agencies; 
● | established relationships with leading brokers across multiple channels of distribution to expand sales reach; 
● | completed a refresh of both the Reed’s and Virgil’s brands which included new package designs, updated web sites and social media platforms, and the development of consumer pull campaigns; 
● | through innovation, developed and announced new product launches: Zero Sugar offerings, can packaging and channel-specific packages and 
● | successfully launched Virgil’s Zero Sugar in cans in five thousand retail outlets including Target and Kroger nationally, which helped drive brand growth of more than 30% in the fourth quarter of 2018. 

 
We believe that we begin 2019 solidly positioned as an asset light company, with a significantly enhanced infrastructure capable of driving accelerated growth well beyond the Company’s current size. The Company now will be able to focus all of its attention and resources on driving growth and building its brands, with capital flexibility, a reduced need for capital expenditures, and an optimized operating model.
 
Industry Overview
 
Reed’s offers its portfolio of natural hand-crafted beverages in the craft specialty foods industry as natural alternatives to the estimated $90 billion mainstream carbonated soft drinks (“CSD”) market in the United States. Reed’s products are sold across the country and internationally in the following major channels: natural food, specialty food, grocery, mass merchant, convenience, club, drug, and on-premise bars and restaurants.
 
While Reed’s is a top-seller in natural food store markets, it also sells nationally to major grocery chains. Sales growth of natural food and beverage products is presently outpacing sales growth for conventional products in every region in the United States. The trend in grocery stores is to expand offerings of natural products. We believe that as we continue to invest our attention and resources in driving accelerated growth and building our brands, we will have the ability to scale our business and continue to build our presence and distribution across all retail channels.

Carbonated Soft Drink Industry Overview
 
The CSD market continues to be a large category in the overall American consumer beverage industry. According to Chicago-based Mintel in April 2017, carbonated soft drinks enjoyed about a 90% household penetration. However, years of CSD decline (13 years of decline through 2017 according to Mintel) have resulted in an urgency to innovate within this category. The ginger ale category has experienced steady CAGR growth of more than 5% over the last 4 years and more than 11% over the latest 52 weeks (based on SPINS MULO/Natural/Specialty Sales ending 12/2/18). Consumers continue to increasingly embrace ginger ingredients and ginger products. More consumers are focused on digestive health and are likely opting for the functional and digestive health benefits of ginger-based beverages. While many consumers clearly still want to indulge in soft drinks, they are turning to ginger beverages as a way to impart some health benefits.


The biggest shift seen over the last decade is a redefinition of what it means to eat and drink healthfully. More consumers are opting for naturally healthful products touting organic and natural appeals. In addition, as the craft and natural soda segment is still underdeveloped at only 1% of the total CSD market, we believe there is significant growth potential to continue to market and sell our portfolio of branded products and encourage consumers to switch away from mainstream beverages that contain artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners and preservatives to great tasting natural alternatives.
 
Consumer Trends Driving Growth for Our Products
 
The following is a list of consumer trends that act as tailwinds as we sell and market our portfolio of ginger beer and handcrafted beverages:
 

● | Growing Consumer Interest in Better-for-You and Healthier Products: According to a recent study, consumers reported that ‘healthy options,’ followed by ‘natural ingredients’ were the two top factors when considering purchasing new products. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Reducing Sugar and Artificial Sweeteners: Consumers are moving away from high sugar beverages and artificially sweetened products. 
● | Authentic and Distinct Brands: There is a broad, cross-generational appeal (Millennials and Boomers alike) for brands with an authentic story, proprietary processes, higher quality ingredients and unique packaging. 
● | Trading up to Premium and Craft: The $500 million craft soda and premium mixer industry segments are growing. Consumers are looking for small batch, handcrafted brands that offer higher quality products and authentic bold flavors. 
● | The Craft Soda Category is Underdeveloped: The craft soda segment is underdeveloped relative to other super-premium food and beverage categories; it is currently less than 1% of the overall CSD category while craft beer accounts for over 20% of the total beer category. 
● | Ginger Use in Beverages is Growing: Ginger is showing up more and more in beverages, and we believe its momentum will continue. 
● | Growth in Non-Alcoholic Alternatives (Mocktails) in On-Premise: More consumers are seeking non-alcoholic alternatives with bold and unique flavors when they go out to bars and restaurants. 
● | Demand for Premium Mixed Drinks: Leading the way in demand has been the Moscow Mule and Mule related cocktails, growing 30% year over year in on-premise sales. They are now in the top five most popular cocktails in the United States according to both Nielsen and Cheers Magazine. 



Our strategies will remain responsive to these macro consumer trends as we concentrate our efforts on developing the Company’s sales and marketing functions.

Our Products
 
Our hand-crafted natural beverages use only premium natural ingredients. Our products are free of genetically modified organisms (“GMOs”) and are gluten free. Over the years, Reed’s has developed several product offerings. In 2018, we streamlined our focus to our core product offerings of Reed’s Craft Ginger Beer and Virgil’s Craft Sodas and launched a new line of Virgil’s Zero Sugar Sodas in twelve ounce cans.
Reed’s Craft Ginger Beer
 
Reed’s Craft Ginger Beer is distinguished from other ginger beers by its proprietary process of brewing fresh ginger root, its exclusive use of all-natural ingredients, and its authentic Jamaican-inspired recipe. We do not use preservatives, artificial flavors, or colors, and our Ginger Beer is certified kosher. We offer different levels of fresh ginger content, ranging from our lightest-spiced Original, to our medium-spiced Extra, and finally to our spiciest Strongest. We also offer two sweetener options: one with cane sugar, honey and fruit juices and another without sugar (Zero Sugar) made from an innovative blend of natural sweeteners (developed in 2018 and commercialized in 2019).
 
As of the end of 2018, the Reed’s Craft Ginger Beer line included three major varieties:
 

● | Reed’s Original Ginger Beer – Our first to market product uses a Jamaican-inspired recipe that calls for fresh ginger root, lemon, lime, honey, raw cane sugar, pineapple, herbs and spices. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Reed’s Extra Ginger Beer – Contains 100% more fresh ginger than Reed’s Original recipe for extra spice. 
● | Reed’s Strongest Ginger Beer – Contains 200% more fresh ginger than Reed’s Original for the strongest spice. 

 
In 2018, we also announced a NEW Zero Sugar Reed’s Craft Ginger Beer to be launched in 2019 in both bottles and first ever cans.
 
Virgil’s Handcrafted Sodas
 
Virgil’s is a premium handcrafted soda that uses only all-natural ingredients to create bold renditions of classic flavors. We don’t use any preservatives, any artificial colors, or any GMO-sourced ingredients, and our Virgil’s line is certified kosher.
 
The Virgil’s line includes the following products:
 
Handcrafted Line: Virgil’s first Handcrafted soda was launched in 1994. It began as one man’s passion to create the finest root beer ever produced and has since won numerous awards. Virgil’s difference is using all-natural ingredients to craft bold, classic soda flavors. Virgil’s Handcrafted line includes Root Beer, Vanilla Cream, Black Cherry, and Orange.
 
Zero Sugar Line: In 2018, Virgil’s launched a new line of Zero Sugar, Zero Calorie craft sodas. Each Zero Sugar soda is sweetened with a proprietary blend of natural sweeteners. This all-natural line of Zero Sugar flavors includes Root Beer, Cola, Black Cherry, Vanilla Cream, Orange and Lemon-Lime. The product has recently been certified Keto compliant.
 
2019 Pilot Test Product Launches
 
By the end of the second quarter of 2019, Reed’s intends to launch pilot tests of its Wellness Ginger Beer with Hemp Extract in the Pacific Northwest and its ready to drink Mule in Seattle, WA.

Our Primary Markets
 
We target a smaller segment of the estimated $90 billion mainstream carbonated and non-carbonated soft drink markets in the U.S., Canada, and international markets. Our brands are generally considered premium and natural, with upscale packaging. They are loosely defined as the craft specialty bottled carbonated soft drink category.
 
We have an experienced and geographically diverse sales force promoting our products, with senior sales representatives strategically placed in multiple regions across the country, supported by local Reed’s sales staff. Additionally, we have sales managers handling national accounts for natural, specialty, grocery, mass, club, drug and convenience channels. Our sales managers are responsible for all activities related to the sales, distribution, and marketing of our brands to our entire retail partner and distributor network in North America. The Company not only employs an internal sales force, but has partnered with independent sales brokers and outside representatives to promote our products in specific channels and key targeted accounts.
 
We sell to well-known popular natural food and gourmet retailers, large grocery store chains, mass merchants, club stores, convenience and drug stores, liquor stores, industrial cafeterias (corporate feeders), and to on-premise bars and restaurants nationwide and in some international markets. We also sell our products and promotional merchandise directly to consumers via the Internet through our Amazon storefront which can be accessed through our company web site www.drinkreeds.com.
 
Some of our representative key customers include:
 

● | Natural stores: Whole Foods Market, Natural Grocers, Earth Fare, Fresh Thyme Farmers Market 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Gourmet & Specialty stores: Trader Joe’s, Bristol Farms, Lazy Acres, The Fresh Market, Central Market 
● | Grocery and Mass chains: Kroger (and all Kroger banners), Safeway, Albertson’s, Publix, Food Lion, Stop & Shop, H.E.B., Wegmans, Target 
● | Club stores: Costco Wholesale 
● | Liquor stores: BevMo!, Total Wine & More, Spec’s 
● | Convenience & Drug stores: Circle K, Rite Aid, CVS Health 

Our Distribution Network
 
Our products are brought to market through an extremely flexible and fluid hybrid distribution model, which is a mix of direct-store-delivery, customer warehouse, and distributor networks. The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics, and local trade practices.
 
Our product reaches the market in the following ways:
 
Direct to Natural & Specialty Wholesale Distributors
 
Our natural and specialty distributor partners operate a distribution network delivering thousands of SKUs of natural and gourmet products to thousands of small, independent, natural retail outlets around the U.S., along with national chain customers, both conventional and natural. This system of distribution allows our brands far reaching access to some of the most remote parts of North America.
Direct to Store Distribution (“DSD”) Through Alcoholic and Non-Alcoholic Beverage Distributor Network
 
Our independent distributor partners operate DSD systems which deliver primarily beverages, foods, and snacks directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by their route sales and field sales employees. DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products frequently restocked and responds to in-store promotion and merchandising.

-

Direct to Store Warehouse Distribution
 
Some of our products are delivered from our co-packers and warehouses directly to customer warehouses. Some retailers mandate we deliver directly to them, as it is more cost effective and allows them to pass savings along to their customers. Other retailers may not mandate direct delivery, but they recommend and prefer it as they have the capability to self-distribute and can realize significant savings with direct delivery.
Wholesale Distribution
 
Our Wholesale Distributor network handles the wholesale shipments of our products. These distributors have a warehouse and distribution center, and ship Reed’s and Virgil’s products directly to the retailer (or to customers who opt for drop shipping).
International Distribution
 
We presently export Reed’s and Virgil’s brands throughout international markets via US based exporters. Some markets where you’ll find our brands at present are: France, UK, South Africa, portions of the Caribbean, Canada, Spain, Philippines, Israel and Australia. In the UK, our Virgil’s brands can be found at Pizza Hut and Tesco.
 
International sales to some areas of the world are cost prohibitive, except for some specialty sales, since our premium sodas were historically packed in glass, which drives substantial freight costs when shipping overseas. Despite these cost challenges, we believe there are good opportunities to expand internationally and we are increasing our marketing focus on these areas by adding freight friendly packages such as aluminum cans. We are open to exporting and co-packing internationally and expanding our brands into foreign markets, and we have held preliminary discussions with trading companies and import/export companies for the distribution of our products throughout Asia, Europe, Australia, and South America. We believe these areas are a natural fit for Reed’s ginger products because of the popularity and importance of ginger in international markets, especially the Asian market, where ginger is a significant part of the local diet and nutrition.
 
We believe the strength of our brands, innovation, and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete effectively.
 
Distribution Agreements
 
We have entered into agreements with some of our distributors that commit us to “termination fees” if we terminate our agreements early or without cause. These agreements provide for our customer to have the right to distribute our products to a defined type of retailer within a defined geographic region. As is customary in the beverage industry, if we should terminate the agreement or not automatically renew the agreement, we would be obligated to make certain payments to our customers. We constantly review our distribution agreements with our partners across North America.
 
Some of our outside distributors are not bound by written agreements with us and may discontinue their relationship with us on short notice. Most distributors handle a number of competitive products. In addition, our products are a small part of our distributors’ businesses.
 
Competition
 
Nonalcoholic Beverages
 
The nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry is highly competitive, consisting of numerous companies ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. The principal areas of competition include pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors, and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers. Many of these brands have enjoyed broad, well-established national recognition for years, through well-funded ad and other branding campaigns. Competitors in the ginger beer category include Goslings, Fever Tree, Bundaberg, Cock ‘n Bull and Q Tonic; in the craft soda category we compete with brands such as Stewart’s, IBC, Zevia, Blue Sky, Hansen’s, Henry Weinhard’s, Boylan, and Jones Soda.

8
-


Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting-edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising, and pricing. We also compete for distributors who will concentrate on marketing our products over those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution, and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. Competitive pressures in the soft drink category could also cause our products to be unable to gain or even lose market share, or we could experience price erosion.
 
Despite our products having a relatively high price for a craft premium beverage product, minimal mass media advertising to date, and a small but growing presence in the mainstream market compared to many of our competitors, we believe our all-natural innovative beverage recipes, packaging, use of premium ingredients, and a proprietary ginger processing formula provide us with a competitive advantage. Our commitments to the highest quality standards and brand innovation are keys to our success.
 
Alcoholic Beverages
 
Our ready to drink Mule test pilot is in its early stages. Many companies have already entered, and others are beginning to enter the ready to drink alcoholic beverage space. Competition for market share and acceptance of new products will be significant.
 
CBD Space
 
Our Wellness Ginger Beer with Hemp Extract test pilot is in its early stages. Cannabidiol (“CBD”) is a naturally occurring extract from cannabis/industrial hemp plants that has health benefits and possible medicinal applications. Many companies are entering the CBD space and competition for market share and acceptance of new products will be significant.
 
Manufacturing Our Products
 
In 2017, our new executive management team performed a complete operational review and developed a detailed action plan to capture performance improvements, drive core brand growth, and become a premier asset-light sales and marketing organization. In keeping with this plan, in December of 2018 we sold our manufacturing and bottling facility in Los Angeles to California Custom Beverage, LLC (“CCB”), an entity owned by Christopher J. Reed, the Company’s founder, director and Chief Innovation Officer. The transaction enables us to focus more on sales, marketing and product innovation.
 
Now, 100% of Reed’s product is produced by our co-pack partners, which assemble our products and charge us a fee, generally by the case, for the products produced. We have long standing relationships with co-packers in Indiana and Pennsylvania. Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of our plant, we entered into a three-year co-packing agreement with CCB, whereby CCB will produce Reed’s Inc. beverages in glass bottles at prevailing West Coast market rates. During the first quarter of 2019, we also entered into a one-year co-packing agreement with Sonoma Beverage Company, also on the West Coast. We are in discussion and negotiation with additional co-packers to secure added capability for future production needs. We periodically review our co-packing relationships to ensure that they are optimal with respect to quality of production, cost and location.
 
Raw Materials
 
General
 
Substantially all of the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by Reed’s or by our contract packers in accordance with our specifications.
 
Generally, the raw materials used in our products are obtained from domestic and foreign suppliers and many of the materials have multiple reliable suppliers. This provides a level of protection against a major supply constriction or adverse cost or supply impacts. Since our raw materials are common ingredients and supply is easily accessible, we have few long-term contracts in place with our suppliers.
 

9
-


A significant component of our product cost is the purchase of glass bottles and aluminum cans. In December 2017, we entered into an exclusive strategic partnership with Owens-Illinois (glass), and in February 2018 we entered into a strategic partnership with Crown for aluminum cans. Both suppliers provide expertise in emerging package and material innovation that can be leveraged to further expand marketing and package offerings.
 
CBD
 
CBD extracts are derived from cannabis/industrial hemp plants. CBD may be legally produced in states which have laws and regulations that qualify under 7 US Code §5940 for implementation of “agricultural pilot programs to study the growth, cultivation or marketing of industrial hemp”, apart from state laws legalizing and regulating medical and recreational cannabis or marijuana which remains illegal under federal law. In addition, Federal licensing for farmers wishing to grow hemp in states that don’t have a pilot program is now available as a result of the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018.
Production
 
As part of our ongoing initiative to simplify and streamline operations, we have identified approximately thirty-five core products on which to place our strategic focus. These core products consist of Reed’s and Virgil’s branded beverages, which accounted for approximately 83% of sales in 2018. Product innovation within these two major lines remains a top priority.
 
Discontinued products consist primarily of certain discontinued Reed’s and Virgil’s SKU’s, certain Reed’s candy SKU’s, Reed’s Kombucha, Reed’s Energy, and China Cola. In conjunction with the December 2018 plant sale, we transferred all rights and contracts pertaining to our private-label business to CCB.
 
Warehousing and Distribution
 
Warehousing and Logistics are a significant portion of the Company’s operational costs. In order to drive efficiency and reduce costs, on February 1, 2019 we entered into a strategic partnership with Veritiv Logistics Solutions to manage all freight movement for the Company. Veritiv is one of the largest distribution service providers in North America and has expertise that will provide a competitive advantage in the movement of raw materials and finished goods. This partnership will support planning and execution of all inventory movement, assessment of storage needs and cost management.
 
We follow a “fill as needed” model to the best of our ability and have no significant order backlog.
 
New Product Development
 
While we have simplified our business and have streamlined a significant number of SKUs in order to further our primary objective of accelerating the growth of the Reed’s and Virgil’s core product offerings, we believe significant opportunity remains in the all-natural beverage space. Healthier alternatives will be the future for carbonated soft drinks. We will continue to drive product development in the all-natural, no and low sugar offerings in the “better for you” beverage categories. In addition, we believe there are powerful consumer trends that will help propel the growth of our brand portfolio including the increased consumption of ginger as a recognized superfood, the growing use of ginger beer in today’s popular cocktail drinks, and consumers’ increased demand for higher quality, all-natural handcrafted beverages.
 
Chris Reed, the Company’s founder and Chief Innovation Officer, continues to support our new product development efforts in 2019. Mr. Reed possesses thirty years of product development and innovation experience. Recent innovations include our compelling line of full flavor, all-natural, zero sugar, zero calorie sodas. Reed’s has also begun to expand and broaden its product development capabilities by engaging and working with larger, experienced beverage flavor houses and innovative ingredient research and supply companies.

We believe our new business model enhances our ability to be nimble and innovative, producing category leading new products in a short period of time.
 
Seasonality
 
Sales of our nonalcoholic beverages are somewhat seasonal with a higher than average volume in the warmer months. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.
Proprietary Rights
 
We own copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets relating to our products and the processes for their production; the packages used for our products; and the design and operation of various processes and equipment used in our business. Some of our proprietary rights are licensed to our co-packers and suppliers and other parties. Reed’s ginger processing and brewing process, finished beverage products and concentrate formulas are among its most valuable trade secrets.
 
We own trademarks in the United States that we consider material to our business. Trademarks in the United States are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Pursuant to our manufacturing and bottling agreements, we authorize our bottlers to use applicable Reed’s trademarks in connection with their manufacture, sale and distribution of our products. We intend to obtain trademarks in international markets as may become necessary.
 
We use confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees, manufacturers and distributors to protect our proprietary rights. Mr. Reed is also subject to an intellectual property agreement with Reed’s restricting competition consistent with his fiduciary obligations to Reed’s.
 
Regulation
 
General
 
The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Lanham Act, state consumer protection laws, competition laws, federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws, various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. Outside the United States, the distribution and sale of our many products and related operations are also subject to numerous similar and other statutes and regulations.
 
A California law known as Proposition 65 requires a specific warning to appear on any product containing a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists. Proposition 65 exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in California because it does not provide for any generally applicable quantitative threshold below which the presence of a listed substance is exempt from the warning requirement. Consequently, the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. However, Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of that product exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is:
 

● | below a “safe harbor” threshold that may be established; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------
● | naturally occurring; 
● | the result of necessary cooking; or 
● | subject to another applicable exemption. 


11
--


No Company beverages produced for sale in California are currently required to display warnings under this law. We are unable to predict whether a component found in a Company product might be added to the California list in the future, although the state has initiated a regulatory process in which caffeine and other natural occurring substances will be evaluated for listing. Furthermore, we are also unable to predict when or whether the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology may become applicable under this law and related regulations as they currently exist, or as they may be amended, might result in the detection of an infinitesimal quantity of a listed substance in a beverage of ours produced for sale in California.
 
Bottlers of our beverage products presently offer and use non-refillable, recyclable containers in the United States. Some of these bottlers also offer and use refillable containers, which are also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring deposits or certain taxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of beverage container-related deposit, recycling, tax and/or product stewardship statutes and regulations also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas. We anticipate additional, similar legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere.
 
All of our facilities and other operations in the United States are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.
 
CBD Space
 
The move toward ending hemp prohibition and the reemergence of a hemp economy began with the 2014 Farm Bill, which provided states with opportunities to create pilot programs for hemp research. The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (“2018 Bill”) was signed into law at the end of December 2018 and expands on the 2014 Farm Bill. The 2018 Bill removes “hemp” from the definition of “Marihuana” in the Controlled Substances Act, decriminalizes the plant and its components, and as a result, transfers oversight of the cultivation and sale of the crop from the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Department of Agriculture. The net result of the 2018 Bill’s passage is that farmers and entrepreneurs gain several significant benefits, in addition to ending the uncertainty of criminal exposure for growing, processing or selling hemp:
 

● | Federal licensing for farmers wishing to grow hemp in states that don’t have a pilot program 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Clarification that interstate commerce in hemp is permitted 
● | Placing oversight of hemp with the USDA, and 
● | Including hemp in the Federal Crop Insurance Act. 

 
These provisions will go a long way toward helping the industry by clarifying existing gray areas of law, creating certainty around transport and interstate sale, and normalizing hemp as an industrial crop. However, there can be no assurance that Federal laws ending hemp prohibition will not be modified or repealed.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our primary cost pertaining to environmental compliance activity is in recycling fees and redemption values. We are required to collect redemption values from our customers and remit those redemption values to the state, based upon the number of bottles or cans of certain products sold in the state.
Our Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we have 50 full-time equivalent employees on our corporate staff. As a result of our Plant Sale (see Note 3 of the Notes to Financial Statements), our Production and Logistics departments were reduced by 24 full-time equivalents in January 2019.

We employ additional people on a part-time basis as needed. We have never participated in a collective bargaining agreement. We believe relations with our employees are good.
