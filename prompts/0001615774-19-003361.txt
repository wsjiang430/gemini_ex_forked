Item 1. Business
 Oxford Square Capital Corp. (“OXSQ,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). We have elected to be treated for tax purposes as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) beginning with our 2003 taxable year. Our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio’s total return. Our primary current focus is to seek an attractive risk-adjusted total return by investing primarily in corporate debt securities and collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) structured finance investments that own corporate debt securities. CLO investments may also include warehouse facilities, which are financing structures intended to aggregate loans that may be used to form the basis of a CLO vehicle. We may also invest in publicly traded debt and/or equity securities. As a BDC, we may not acquire any asset other than “qualifying assets” unless, at the time we make the acquisition, the value of our qualifying assets represents at least 70% of the value of our total assets.
 Our capital is generally used by our corporate borrowers to finance organic growth, acquisitions, recapitalizations and working capital. Our investment decisions are based on extensive analysis of potential portfolio companies’ business operations supported by an in-depth understanding of the quality of their recurring revenues and cash flow, variability of costs and the inherent value of their assets, including proprietary intangible assets and intellectual property. In making our CLO investments, we consider the indenture structure for that vehicle, its operating characteristics and compliance with its various indenture provisions, as well as its corporate loan-based collateral pool.
 We generally expect to invest between $5.0 million and $50.0 million in each of our portfolio investments, although this investment size may vary as the size of our capital base changes and market conditions warrant. We invest in both fixed and variable interest rate structures. We expect that our investment portfolio will be diversified among a large number of investments with few investments, if any, exceeding 5% of the total portfolio.
 The structures of our investments will vary and we seek to invest across a wide range of different industries. We seek to invest in entities that, as a general matter, have been operating for at least one year prior to the date of our investment and that will, at the time of our investment, have employees and revenues, and which are cash flow positive. Many of these companies are expected to have financial backing provided by other financial or strategic sponsors at the time we make an investment. The portfolio companies in which we invest, however, will generally be considered below investment grade, and their debt securities may in turn be referred to as “junk.” A portion of our investment portfolio may consist of debt investments for which issuers are not required to make significant principal payments until the maturity of the senior loans, which could result in a substantial loss to us if such issuers are unable to refinance or repay their debt at maturity. In addition, many of the debt securities we hold typically contain interest reset provisions that may make it more difficult for a borrower to repay the loan, heightening the risk that we may lose all or part of our investment.
 We also purchase portions of equity and junior debt tranches of CLO vehicles. Substantially all of the CLO vehicles in which we may invest would be deemed to be investment companies under the 1940 Act but for the exceptions set forth in section 3(c)(1) or section 3(c)(7). Other than CLO vehicles, we do not intend to invest, and we would be limited to 15% of our net assets if we did invest, in any types of entities that rely on the exceptions set forth in section 3(c)(1) or section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act. Structurally, CLO vehicles are entities that are formed to originate and manage a portfolio of loans. The loans within the CLO vehicle are limited to loans which meet established credit criteria and are subject to concentration limitations in order to limit a CLO vehicle’s exposure to a single credit. A CLO vehicle is formed by raising various classes or “tranches” of debt (with the most senior tranches being rated “AAA” to the most junior tranches typically being rated “BB” or “B”) and equity. The tranches of CLO vehicles rated “BB” or “B” may be referred to as “junk.” The equity of a CLO vehicle is generally required to absorb the CLO’s losses before any of the CLO’s other tranches, yet it also has the lowest level of payment priority among the CLO’s tranches; therefore, the equity is typically the riskiest of CLO investments which, if it were rated, may also be referred to as “junk.” We primarily focus on investing in the junior tranches and the equity of CLO vehicles. The CLO vehicles which we focus on are collateralized primarily by senior secured loans made to companies whose debt is unrated or is rated below investment grade, and generally have very little or no direct exposure to real estate, mortgage loans or to pools of consumer-based debt, such as credit card receivables or auto loans. However, there can be no assurance that the collateral securing such senior secured loans would satisfy all of the unpaid principal and interest of our investment in the CLO vehicle in the event of default and the junior tranches, especially the equity tranches, of CLO vehicles are the last tranches to be paid, if at all, in the event of a default. Our investment strategy may also include warehouse facilities, which are financing structures intended to aggregate loans that may be used to form the basis of a CLO vehicle.

We have historically borrowed funds to make investments and may continue to do so. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of leverage, which may be considered a speculative investment technique. Borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain and loss on amounts invested and therefore increase the risks associated with investing in our securities. In addition, the costs associated with our borrowings, including any increase in the management fee payable to our investment adviser, Oxford Square Management, LLC (“Oxford Square Management”), will be borne by our common stockholders.
 6.50% Unsecured Notes
 On April 12, 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of approximately $64.4 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.50% unsecured notes due 2024, or the “6.50% Unsecured Notes.” The 6.50% Unsecured Notes will mature on March 30, 2024, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after March 30, 2020. The 6.50% Unsecured Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.50% per year payable quarterly on March 30, June 30, September 30, and December 30 of each year. The 6.50% Unsecured Notes are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol “OXSQL.”
 OXSQ Facility
 On June 21, 2018, Oxford Square Funding 2018, LLC (“OXSQ Funding”), a special purpose vehicle that is our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a credit facility (the “OXSQ Facility”) with Citibank, N.A. On October 12, 2018, OXSQ Funding amended the OXSQ Facility to provide for additional borrowings under the OXSQ Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the OXSQ Facility, as amended, OXSQ Funding increased the outstanding principal borrowing to $125.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, the total principal outstanding was approximately $85.7 million. Subject to certain exceptions, pricing under the OXSQ Facility is based on the London interbank offered rate for an interest period equal to three months plus a spread of 2.25% per annum. Interest on the outstanding principal amount owing under the OXSQ Facility is payable quarterly in arrears. The OXSQ Facility will mature, and all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on June 21, 2020, and is subject to periodic repayment prior to such date from collections on OXSQ Funding’s loan assets and certain other mandatory payment requirements.
 Organizational and Regulatory Structure
 Our investment activities are managed by Oxford Square Management. Oxford Square Management is an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). Oxford Square Management is owned by Oxford Funds, LLC (“Oxford Funds”), its managing member, and Charles M. Royce, a member of our Board of Directors who holds a minority, non-controlling interest in Oxford Square Management. Jonathan H. Cohen, our Chief Executive Officer, and Saul B. Rosenthal, our President and Chief Operating Officer, directly or indirectly own or control all of the outstanding equity interests of Oxford Funds. Under the investment advisory agreement, we have agreed to pay Oxford Square Management an annual base management fee based on our gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our performance. Refer to “— Investment Advisory Agreement”.
 We were founded in July 2003 and completed an initial public offering of shares of our common stock in November 2003. We are a Maryland corporation and a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. As a BDC, we are required to meet certain regulatory tests, including the requirement to invest at least 70% of our total assets in eligible portfolio companies. Refer to “— Regulation as a Business Development Company.” In addition, we have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).

 MARKET OVERVIEW AND OPPORTUNITY
 The market volatility and downdraft in the fourth quarter made 2018 a challenging year for corporate loans and CLO equity. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the S&P / LSTA Leveraged Loan Index fell from a price of 98.60% to 93.84% by the end of December. We believe the decrease in U.S. loan prices during the fourth quarter of 2018 was in part driven by large outflows out of U.S. loan mutual funds and ETFs. We believe that the fundamentals across the U.S. loan market continue to be stable. Corporate loan default rates remain at low levels, providing investors with a generally lower-risk, lower-return corporate debt environment. At the present time, approximately only 1% of the S&P / LSTA Leveraged Loan Index trades at a price of “par” or higher. This environment may allow CLO managers to buy performing loan assets in the secondary market at discounts to par, which may build CLO asset value and spread over time, ultimately accruing to the benefit of CLO equity. Moreover, as we execute our corporate loan strategy of focusing primarily on smaller broadly-syndicated loans, narrowly syndicated loans and club deals, through purchases in both the primary and secondary markets, we remain mindful of maintaining overall portfolio liquidity. We believe this strategy allows us to maintain corporate debt investments which have sufficient liquidity in order to take advantage of market opportunities.
 We continue to view our mandate as maximizing the risk-adjusted return on our stockholders’ investment in OXSQ. We view the market opportunity currently available to us as strong and, as a permanent capital vehicle, we have historically been able to take a longer-term view towards our investments. We believe this perspective served us well in 2018.
 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
 We believe that we are well positioned to provide financing to corporate borrowers and structured finance vehicles that, in turn, provide capital to corporate borrowers for the following reasons:
 •     Expertise in credit analysis and monitoring investments; and
 •     Established transaction sourcing network.

  Expertise in credit analysis and monitoring investments
 While our investment focus is on middle-market companies, we have invested, and in the future will likely continue to invest, in larger and smaller companies and in other investment structures on an opportunistic basis, including CLO investment vehicles. We believe our experience in analyzing middle-market companies and CLO investment structures, as detailed in the biographies of Oxford Square Management’s senior investment professionals, affords us a sustainable competitive advantage over lenders with limited experience in investing in these markets. In particular, we have expertise in evaluating the investment merits of middle-market companies as well as the structural features of CLO investments, and monitoring the credit risk of such investments after closing until full repayment.

Established deal sourcing network
 Through the investment professionals of Oxford Square Management, we have extensive contacts and sources from which to generate investment opportunities. These contacts and sources include private equity funds, companies, brokers and bankers. We believe that senior professionals of Oxford Square Management have developed strong relationships within the investment community over their years within the banking, investment management and equity research fields.
 INVESTMENT PROCESS
 Identification
 We identify opportunities in the CLO market through our network of brokers, dealers, agent banks, collateral mangers and sponsors that we have worked with for several years. The CLO vehicles which we focus on are collateralized primarily by senior secured loans made to companies whose debt is unrated or is rated below investment grade, and generally have very little or no direct exposure to real estate, mortgage loans or to pools of consumer-based debt, such as credit card receivables or auto loans.
 We identify and source new prospective corporate debt investments through brokers, investment banks and direct company relationships. We have identified several criteria that we believe are important in seeking our investment objective. These criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions; however, we do not require each prospective investment to meet all or any specific number of these criteria.
 •      Experienced management.    We generally require that our portfolio companies have an experienced management team. We also prefer the portfolio companies to have in place proper incentives to induce management to succeed and to act in concert with our interests as investors, including having significant equity interests.
 •      Significant financial or strategic sponsor and/or strategic partner.    We prefer to invest in companies in which established private equity or venture capital funds or other financial or strategic sponsors have previously invested and are willing to make an ongoing contribution to the management of the business, including participation as board members or as business advisers.
 •      Strong competitive position in industry.    We seek to invest in companies that have developed a competitive position within their respective sector or niche of a specific industry.
 •      Profitable on a cash flow basis.    We focus on companies that are profitable or nearly profitable on an operating cash flow basis. Typically, we would not expect to invest in start-up companies.
 •      Clearly defined exit strategy.    Prior to making a direct corporate equity investment and/or an investment in a debt security that is accompanied by an equity-based security in a portfolio company, we analyze the potential for that company to increase the liquidity of its common equity through a future event that would enable us to realize appreciation, if any, in the value of our equity interest. Liquidity events may include an initial public offering, a merger or an acquisition of the company, a private sale of our equity interest to a third party, or a purchase of our equity position by the company or one of its stockholders.
 •      Liquidation value of assets.     Although we do not operate as an asset-based lender, the prospective liquidation value of the assets, if any, collateralizing the debt securities that we hold is a consideration in our credit analysis. We consider both tangible assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, and intangible assets, such as intellectual property, software code, customer lists, networks and databases.

  Due Diligence
 Our due diligence process generally includes some or all of the following elements:
 Corporate Loans
 Management team and financial sponsor
 •      management assessment including a review of management’s track record with respect to product development, sales and marketing, mergers and acquisitions, alliances, collaborations, research and development outsourcing and other strategic activities; and
 •      financial sponsor reputation, track record, experience and knowledge (where a financial sponsor is present in a transaction).
 Business
 •      industry and competitive analysis;
 •      assessment of likely exit strategies; and
 •      potential regulatory/legal issues.
 Financial condition
 •      detailed review of the historical financial performance and the quality of earnings;
 •      development of detailed pro forma financial projections; and
 •      review of assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities.
 Structured Finance Vehicles
 •      review of indenture structures;
 •      review of underlying collateral loans;
 •      analysis of projected future cash flows; and
 •      analysis of compliance with covenants.
 Contemporaneous with our due diligence process, the investment team presents the investment proposal to our Investment Committee, which currently consists of Messrs. Cohen, Rosenthal and Monasebian. Our Investment Committee reviews and approves each of our portfolio investments.
Investment Characteristics
 In identifying corporate debt investments, we seek to ascertain the asset quality as well as the earnings quality of our prospective portfolio companies. Frequently, we obtain a senior secured position and thus receive a perfected, first or second priority security interest in substantially all of our portfolio companies’ assets, which entitles us to a preferred position on payments in the event of liquidation. It should be noted, however, that because we are not primarily an asset-based lender, in the current economic environment, the value of collateral and security interests may dissipate rapidly. In addition, in certain investments we seek loan covenants or to participate in syndicated loans that incorporate loan covenants that assist in the early identification of risk. Our loan documents may include affirmative covenants that require the portfolio company to take specific actions such as: periodic financial reporting; notification of material events and compliance with laws; restrictive covenants that prevent portfolio companies from taking a range of significant actions such as incurring additional indebtedness or making acquisitions without our consent; covenants requiring the portfolio company to maintain or achieve specified financial ratios such as debt to cash flow and interest coverage; and operating covenants requiring them to maintain certain operational benchmarks such as minimum revenue or minimum cash flow. Our loan documents also provide protection against customary events of default such as non-payment, breach of covenant, insolvency and change of control.

In identifying CLO investments, we seek to ascertain the asset quality of the underlying collateral pool, the structural integrity of the CLO liability capital structure, the expected return profile of the CLO equity or debt tranche we are investing in as well as the quality of the prospective collateral manager. The underlying portfolio of each CLO investment is typically diversified across approximately 100 to 250 broadly syndicated loans which are predominantly 1st lien senior secured term loans to U.S. corporations. Additionally, these collateral pools typically do not have direct exposure to real estate, mortgages, or consumer-based credit assets. Our investment focus is generally agnostic between the primary and secondary CLO markets. In both markets, we pursue opportunities which we view to have attractive optionality with regards to the ability to refinance or “reset” the CLO liability capital structure at some point in the future. A CLO “reset” typically includes an extension of the CLO’s reinvestment period in addition to the refinancing of the CLO liabilities. We continue to prefer CLO equity investments which have longer reinvestment periods which may give CLO managers additional time to rebuild collateral value from potential credit losses as well as take advantage of a potential disruption in the broader credit markets.

MONITORING RELATIONSHIPS WITH PORTFOLIO COMPANIES
 Monitoring
 We monitor the financial trends of each portfolio company to assess the appropriate course of action for each investment and to evaluate overall portfolio quality. We closely monitor the status and performance of each individual company on at least a quarterly and, in some cases, a monthly basis.
 We have several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance of our investments, including but not limited to the following:
 •      assessment of business development success, and the portfolio company’s overall adherence to its business plan; and
 •      review of monthly and/or quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies.
 In addition, we may from time to time identify investments that require closer monitoring or become workout assets. In such cases, we will develop a strategy for workout assets and periodically gauge our progress against that strategy. As a private debt holder, we may incur losses from our investing activities from time to time; however, we attempt, where possible, to work with troubled portfolio companies in order to recover as much of our investments as is practicable.
 Portfolio Grading
 We have developed a credit grading system to monitor the quality of our debt investment portfolio. We use an investment rating scale of 1 to 5. The following table provides a description of the conditions associated with each debt investment. Equity securities, including CLO equity tranches, are not graded.

Grade | Summary Description 
------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 | Company is ahead of expectations and/or outperforming financial covenant requirements of the specific tranche and such trend is expected to continue. 
2 | Full repayment of the outstanding amount of OXSQ’s cost basis and interest is expected for the specific tranche. 
3 | Closer monitoring is required. Full repayment of the outstanding amount of OXSQ’s cost basis and interest is expected for the specific tranche. 
4 | A loss of interest income has occurred or is expected to occur and, in most cases, the investment is placed on non-accrual status. Full repayment of the outstanding amount of OXSQ’s cost basis is expected for the specific tranche.
5 | Full repayment of the outstanding amount of OXSQ’s cost basis is not expected for the specific tranche and the investment is placed on non-accrual status. 

Significant Managerial Assistance
 As a BDC, we are required to offer significant managerial assistance to portfolio companies. This assistance, were it to be accepted, would typically involve monitoring the operations of portfolio companies, participating in their board and management meetings, consulting with and advising their officers and providing other organizational and financial guidance.
Portfolio Overview
 We seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily CLO investments, senior secured loans, senior subordinated and junior subordinated debt investments, as well as warrants and other equity instruments we may receive in connection with such debt investments. We generally expect to invest between $5 million and $50 million in each of our portfolio companies. We expect that our investment portfolio will be diversified among a large number of investments with few investments, if any, exceeding 5% of the total portfolio.

 INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
 Management Services
 Oxford Square Management serves as our investment adviser. Oxford Square Management is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, Oxford Square Management manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory services to us. Under the terms of our Investment Advisory Agreement with Oxford Square Management (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”), Oxford Square Management:
 •      determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;
 •      identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make;
 •      closes, monitors and services the investments we make; and
 •     determines what securities we will purchase, retain or sell.

10
  Oxford Square Management’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. Oxford Square Management has agreed that, during the term of its Investment Advisory Agreement with us, it will not serve as investment adviser to any other public or private entity that utilizes a principal investment strategy of providing debt financing to middle-market companies similar to those we target.
 Management Fee
 We pay Oxford Square Management a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components — a base management fee (the “Base Fee”) and an incentive fee. The cost of both the Base Fee payable to Oxford Square Management and any incentive fees earned by Oxford Square Management are ultimately borne by our common stockholders.
 Through March 31, 2016, the Base Fee was calculated at an annual rate of 2.00%. Effective April 1, 2016, the Base Fee is currently calculated at an annual rate of 1.50%. The Base Fee is payable quarterly in arrears, and is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any equity or debt capital raises, repurchases or redemptions during the current calendar quarter (however, no Base Fee will be payable on the cash proceeds received by us in connection with any share or debt issuances until such proceeds have been invested in accordance with our investment objective). Accordingly, the Base Fee will be payable regardless of whether the value of our gross assets has decreased during the quarter. The Base Fee for any partial quarter will be appropriately prorated.
 The incentive fee has two parts: the net investment income incentive fee and the capital gains incentive fee. The net investment income incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the amount by which (x) the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” for the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds (y) the “Preferred Return Amount” for the calendar quarter. For this purpose, “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any accrued income that we have not yet received in cash and any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses accrued the calendar quarter (including the Base Fee, expenses payable under a separate agreement with Oxford Funds (the “Administration Agreement”) and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Oxford Square Management will not be under any obligation to reimburse us for any part of the incentive fee it received that was based on accrued income that we never receive as a result of a default by an entity on the obligation that resulted in the accrual of such income. “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” does not include any realized gains, realized losses or unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Given that this portion of the incentive fee is payable without regard to any gain, loss or unrealized depreciation that may occur during the quarter, this portion of Oxford Square Management’s incentive fee may be payable notwithstanding a decline in net asset value that quarter.
 From January 1, 2005 through March 31, 2016, the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income,” which was expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, was compared to one-fourth of an annual hurdle rate that was determined as of the immediately preceding December 31 by adding 5.00% to the interest rate then payable on the most recently issued five-year U.S. Treasury Notes, up to a maximum annual hurdle rate of 10.00%. The annual hurdle used to calculate the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 was 6.76%.
 Effective April 1, 2016, a “Preferred Return Amount” is calculated on a quarterly basis by multiplying 1.75% by the Company’s net asset value at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. The net investment income incentive fee is then calculated as follows: (a) no net investment income incentive fee is payable to Oxford Square Management in any calendar quarter in which the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” does not exceed the “Preferred Return Amount”; (b) 100% of the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” for such quarter, if any, that exceeds the “Preferred Return Amount” but is less than or equal to a “Catch-Up Amount” determined on a quarterly basis by multiplying 2.1875% by OXSQ’s net asset value at the end of such calendar quarter; and (c) for any quarter in which the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” exceeds the “Catch-Up Amount,” the net investment income incentive fee will be 20% of the amount of the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” for such quarter. There is no accumulation of amounts from quarter to quarter for the “Preferred Return Amount,” and accordingly there is no claw back of amounts previously paid to Oxford Square Management if the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” for subsequent quarters is below the quarterly “Preferred Return Amount,” and there is no delay of payment of incentive fees to Oxford Square Management if the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” for prior quarters is below the quarterly “Preferred Return Amount” for the quarter for which the calculation is being made.

11
 
In addition, effective April 1, 2016, the calculation of the Company’s net investment income incentive fee is subject to a total return requirement (the “Total Return Requirement”), which provides that a net investment income incentive fee will not be payable to Oxford Square Management except to the extent 20% of the “cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations” (which is the amount, if positive, of the sum of the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income,” realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation) during the calendar quarter for which such fees are being calculated and the eleven (11) preceding quarters (or if shorter, the number of quarters since April 1, 2016) exceeds the cumulative net investment income incentive fees accrued and/or paid for such eleven (11) preceding quarters (or if shorter, the number of quarters since April 1, 2016). Under the revised fee structure, under no circumstances will the aggregate fees earned from April 1, 2016 by Oxford Square Management in any quarterly period be higher than the aggregate fees that would have been earned prior to the adoption of these changes.
 The capital gains part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20% of our “Incentive Fee Capital Gains,” which consists of our realized capital gains for each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation for that calendar year. For accounting purposes under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the capital gains incentive fee calculated is based on a hypothetical liquidation of the Company. In such a calculation, in order to reflect the theoretical capital gains incentive fee that would be payable for a given period as if all unrealized gains were realized, we will accrue a capital gains incentive fee based upon net realized gains and unrealized depreciation for that calendar year (in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement), plus unrealized appreciation on investments held at the end of the period. It should be noted that a fee so calculated and accrued would not necessarily be payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, and may never be paid based upon the computation of capital gains incentive fees in subsequent periods. Amounts paid under the Investment Advisory Agreement will be consistent with the formula reflected in the Investment Advisory Agreement.
 Example 1: Net Investment Income Portion of Incentive Fee for Each Calendar Quarter
 Alternative 1
 Assumptions
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25%
 Quarterly Hurdle rate = 1.75%
 Management fee(1) = 0.375%
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2%
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.675%
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no income-related incentive fee.
 Alternative 2
 Assumptions
 Quarterly Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.50%
 Quarterly Hurdle rate = 1.75%
 Management fee(1) = 0.375%

12
  Quarterly Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2%
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 1.925%
 The Total Return Requirement is met (no net investment income incentive fee would be payable if the Total Return Requirement were not met).
 The aggregate fees that would have been earned prior to the adoption of the April 1, 2016 changes, as described above, exceed the current aggregate fees.
 Incentive fee = 100%* Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in excess of the hurdle rate but less than 2.1875% and 20% of any Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income thereafter.
 = 100%* (1.925% – 1.75%)
 = 100%* 0.175%
 = 0.175%
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875%. Therefore the income-related incentive fee is 0.175%.
 Alternative 3
 Assumptions
 Quarterly Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 4.00%
 Quarterly Hurdle rate = 1.75%
 Management fee(1) = 0.375%
 Quarterly Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2%
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 3.425%
 The Total Return Requirement is met (no net investment income incentive fee would be payable if the Total Return Requirement were not met).
 The aggregate fees that would have been earned prior to the adoption of the April 1, 2016 changes, as described above, exceed the current aggregate fees.
 Incentive fee = 100% * Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in excess of the hurdle rate but less than 2.1875% and 20% of any Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income thereafter.
 = 100%* (2.1875% – 1.75%) + 20%* (3.425% – 2.1875%)
 = 100%* 0.4375% + 20%* 1.2375%
 = 0.4375% + 0.2475%
 = 0.685%
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate and 2.1875%. Therefore the income-related incentive fee is 0.685%.

  Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee(*)
 Capital Gains Incentive Fee = 20% × Incentive Fee Capital Gains (i.e., our realized capital gains for each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation for that calendar year)
Assumptions:
 •      Year 1 = no realized capital gains or losses
 •      Year 2 = 9% realized capital gains, 0% realized capital losses, 1% unrealized depreciation and 0% unrealized appreciation
 •      Year 3 = 12% realized capital gains, 0% realized capital losses, 2% unrealized depreciation and 2% unrealized appreciation
 
Year 1 incentive fee | • Total Incentive Fee Capital Gains = 0 
---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | • No capital gains incentive fee paid to Oxford Square Management in Year 1 
Year 2 incentive fee | • Total Incentive Fee Capital Gains = 8% 
 | (9% realized capital gains less 1% unrealized depreciation) 
 | • Total capital gains incentive fee paid to Oxford Square Management in Year 2 
 | = 20% × 8% 
 | = 1.6% 
Year 3 incentive fee | • Total Incentive Fee Capital Gains = 10% 
 | (12% realized capital gains less 2% unrealized depreciation; unrealized appreciation has no effect)
 | • Total capital gains incentive fee paid to Oxford Square Management in Year 3 
 | = 20% × 10% 
 | = 2%

CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
 As a BDC, we have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, beginning with our 2003 taxable year. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To continue to qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”).

16
 
Taxation as a RIC
 If we:
 •      qualify as a RIC; and
 •      satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement,
 then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) we distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders.
 We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, and on which we paid no corporate-level U.S. federal income tax, in preceding years (the “Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement”). We generally will endeavor in each taxable year to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to satisfy the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement.
 In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:
 •      at all times during each taxable year, be registered under the 1940 Act as a management company or unit investment trust, or have in effect an election under the 1940 Act to be treated as a BDC;
 •      derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities (the “90% Income Test”); and
 •      diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
 •      at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and
 •      no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (the “Diversification Tests”).
 We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest and deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. In addition, we may be required to accrue for U.S. federal income tax purposes amounts attributable to our investment in CLOs that may differ from the distributions received in respect of such investments. Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds, to sell assets and to make taxable distributions of our stock and debt securities in order to satisfy distribution requirements. Our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC and become subject to tax as an ordinary corporation.

17
 
Under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. If we are prohibited to make distributions, we may fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC and become subject to tax as an ordinary corporation.
 We have purchased and may in the future purchase residual or subordinated interests in CLOs that are treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as shares in a “passive foreign investment company” (a “PFIC”). We may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our allocable share of a portion of any “excess distribution” received on, or any gain from the disposition of, such shares, even if our allocable share of such income is distributed as a taxable distribution to the PFIC’s stockholders. Additional charges, in the nature of interest, generally will be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from any such excess distribution or gain. If we elect to treat a PFIC as a “qualified electing fund” under the Code (a “QEF”), in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year our proportionate share of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed by the QEF. Alternatively, we may be able to elect to mark-to-market at the end of each taxable year our shares in a PFIC; in this case, we will recognize as ordinary income our allocable share of any increase in the value of such shares, and as ordinary loss our allocable share of any decrease in such value to the extent that any such decrease does not exceed prior increases included in our income. Under either election, we may be required to recognize in a year income in excess of distributions from PFICs and proceeds from dispositions of PFIC shares during that year, and such income will nevertheless be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement.
 If we hold more than 10% of the shares in a foreign corporation that is treated as a controlled foreign corporation (“CFC”) (including equity tranche investments in a CLO treated as a CFC), we may be treated as receiving a deemed distribution (taxable as ordinary income) each year from such foreign corporation in an amount equal to our pro rata share of the corporation’s income for the tax year (including both ordinary earnings and capital gains), whether or not the corporation makes an actual distribution during such year. This deemed distribution is required to be included in the income of a U.S. Stockholder (as defined below) of a CFC regardless of whether the stockholder has made a QEF election with respect to such CFC. In general, a foreign corporation will be classified as a CFC if more than 50% of the shares of the corporation, measured by reference to combined voting power or value, is owned (directly, indirectly or by attribution) by U.S. Stockholders. A “U.S. Stockholder,” for this purpose, is any U.S. person that possesses (actually or constructively) 10% or more of the combined voting power or value of all classes of shares of a corporation. If we are treated as receiving a deemed distribution from a CFC, we will be required to include such distribution in our investment company taxable income regardless of whether we receive any actual distributions from such CFC, and we must distribute such income to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement.
 Although the Code generally provides that income inclusions from a QEF or a CFC will be “good income” for purposes of the 90% Income Test to the extent that the QEF or the CFC distribute such income to us in the same taxable year to which the income is included in our income, the Code does not specifically provide whether income inclusions would be “good income” for the 90% Income Test if we do not receive distributions from the QEF or CFC during such taxable year. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has issued a series of private rulings in which it has concluded that all income inclusions from a QEF or a CFC included in a RIC’s gross income would constitute “good income” for purposes of the 90% Income Test. Although such rulings are not binding on the IRS except with respect to the taxpayers to whom such rulings were issued under current law, we believe that the income inclusions from a QEF or a CFC would be “good income” for purposes of the 90% Income Test whether or not we receive a cash distribution from such CLOs in the same year as the required income inclusion. However, no guaranty can be made that the IRS would not assert that such income would not be “good income” for purposes of the 90% Income Test to the extent that we do not receive timely distributions of such income from the CLO. If such income were not considered “good income” for purposes of the 90% Income Test, we may fail to qualify as a RIC.

18
  Proposed regulations may impact our ability to qualify as a RIC if we do not receive timely distributions from our CLO Investments
 The IRS and U.S. Treasury Department have issued proposed regulations that provide that the income inclusions from a QEF or a CFC would not be good income for purposes of the 90% Income Test unless we receive a cash distribution from such entity in the same year attributable to the included income. If these regulations are finalized, we will carefully monitor our investments in CLOs to avoid disqualification as a RIC.
 Failure to Qualify as a RIC
 If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, and certain cure provisions are not met, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. Distributions would not be required, and any distributions made would be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income that, subject to certain limitations, may be eligible for the 20.0% maximum rate to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. To requalify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the nonqualifying year, we would be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized within the subsequent 5 years, unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on such built-in gains at the time of our requalification as a RIC.
 REGULATION AS A BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COMPANY
 General
 A BDC is regulated by the 1940 Act. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to invest in long-term, private investments in businesses. A BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock, while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies.
 We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (i) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We currently do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business.
 As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to the company or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
 As a BDC, we are required to meet a coverage ratio of the value of total assets to total senior securities, which includes all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200%. On March 23, 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act (the “SBCAA”) was signed into law, which included various changes to regulations under the federal securities laws that impact BDCs. The SBCAA included changes to the 1940 Act to allow BDCs to decrease their asset coverage requirement to 150% from 200% under certain circumstances. On April 6, 2018, the Board of Directors, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board of Directors, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCAA. As a result, our asset coverage requirements for senior securities will be changed from 200% to 150%, effective as of April 6, 2019. We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC.

We are not generally able to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. Refer to “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to our Business and Structure — Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we raise additional capital, which may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.” We may, however, sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share (i) in connection with a rights offering to our existing stockholders, (ii) with the consent of the majority of our common stockholders, or (iii) under such other circumstances as the SEC may permit. For example, we may sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then current net asset value of our common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve our policy and practice of making such sales. In any such case, under such circumstances, the price at which our common stock is to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board of Directors, closely approximates the market value of such common stock. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below the net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of distributions and in certain other limited circumstances.
 We may be examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
 As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to our Business and Structure.”
 Qualifying Assets
 As a BDC, we may not acquire any asset other than “qualifying assets” unless, at the time we make the acquisition, the value of our qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the value of our total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are:
 •      Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering, the issuer of which is an eligible portfolio company;
 •      Securities received in exchange for or distributed with respect to securities described in the bullet above or pursuant to the exercise of options, warrants or rights relating to such securities; and
 •      Cash, cash items, government securities or high quality debt securities (within the meaning of the 1940 Act), maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
 An eligible portfolio company is generally a domestic company that is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by a BDC) and that:
 •      does not have a class of securities with respect to which a broker may extend margin credit at the time the acquisition is made;
 •      is controlled by the BDC and has an affiliate of the BDC on its board of directors;
 •      does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange;
 •      is a public company that lists its securities on a national securities exchange with a market capitalization of less than $250 million; or
 •      meets such other criteria as may be established by the SEC.
 Control, as defined by the 1940 Act, is presumed to exist where a BDC beneficially owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company.
 In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in eligible portfolio companies, or in other securities that are consistent with its purpose as a BDC.

  Significant Managerial Assistance
 BDCs generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the BDC controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. The Administrator or its affiliate provides such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance.
Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policy
 As required by the 1940 Act, we maintain a Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policy, or “Code of Ethics,” that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain transactions by our personnel. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to our Business and Structure — There are significant potential conflicts of interest between OXSQ and our management team.” Our Code of Ethics generally does not permit investments by our employees in securities that may be purchased or held by us. The Code of Ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. You may obtain copies of the Code of Ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following email address: publicinfo@sec.gov. Our Code of Ethics is also available on our website at http://oxfordsquarecapital.com/.
Compliance Policies and Procedures
 We and our investment adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and to designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:
 •      Pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”), our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
 •      Pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
 •      Pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management must prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and
 •      Pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our investment adviser, Oxford Square Management. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of Oxford Square Management are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by Oxford Square Management, and, accordingly, are subject to change.

  Introduction
 As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, Oxford Square Management has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, Oxford Square Management recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients.
 These policies and procedures for voting proxies for Oxford Square Management’s investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
 Proxy Policies
 Oxford Square Management will vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in the best interests of our stockholders. Oxford Square Management will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by OXSQ. Although Oxford Square Management will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. Oxford Square Management will abstain from voting only in unusual circumstances and where there is a compelling reason to do so.
 The proxy voting decisions of Oxford Square Management are made by the senior officers of Oxford Square Management who are responsible for monitoring each of our investments. To ensure that its vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, Oxford Square Management requires that: (i) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to Oxford Square Management’s Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (ii) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how Oxford Square Management intends to vote on a proposal without the prior approval of the Chief Compliance Officer and senior management in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
