ITEM 1. BUSINESS:
General Description of Business, Offering and Structure
 
The Lightstone Income Trust, incorporated in Maryland on September 9, 2014, elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (‘‘REIT’’) beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2016.
 
On September 12, 2014, Lightstone Income Trust sold 20,000 Common Shares to Lightstone Real Estate Income LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the ‘‘Advisor’’), an entity majority owned by David Lichtenstein for $10.00 per share. Mr. Lichtenstein also is a majority owner of the equity interests of Lightstone Income Trust’s sponsor, The Lightstone Group, LLC (the ‘‘Sponsor’’).
 
Subject to the oversight of Lightstone Income Trust’s board of directors (the “Board of Directors”), the Advisor has primary responsibility for making investment decisions and managing Lightstone Income Trust’s day-to-day operations. Mr. Lichtenstein also acts as the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, he exerts influence over but does not control the Lightstone Income Trust.
 
Lightstone Income Trust, together with its subsidiaries, is collectively referred to as the ‘‘Company’’ and the use of ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘our,’’ ‘‘us’’ or similar pronouns refers to Lightstone Income Trust or the Company as required by the context in which any such pronoun is used.
 
The Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-200464) (the “Registration Statement”) pursuant to which it offered to sell (the “Offering”) up to 30,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (which may be referred to herein as ‘‘shares of common stock’’ or as ‘‘Common Shares’’) at an initial price of $10.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts (the “Primary Offering”) (exclusive of 10,000,000 shares which were available pursuant to its distribution reinvestment program (the ‘‘DRIP’’) which were offered at a discounted price equivalent to 95% of the initial price of $10.00 per Common Share) was declared effective on February 26, 2015 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under Exchange Act.
 
The Offering, which terminated on March 31, 2017, raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $85.6 million from the sale of approximately 8.9 million shares of common stock (including $2.0 million in Common Shares at a purchase price of $9.00 per Common Share to an entity 100% owned by David Lichtenstein, who also owns a majority interest in the Company’s Sponsor). After including aggregate principal advances from our Sponsor of $12.6 million made under a subordinated loan agreement (the “Subordinated Agreement”) (as discussed below) and allowing for the payment of approximately $7.6 million in selling commissions and dealer manager fees and $3.2 million in organization and offering expenses, the Offering generated aggregate net proceeds of approximately $87.5 million.
 
On April 21, 2017, the Board of Directors approved the termination of our DRIP effective May 15, 2017. As a result, all subsequent distributions have been in the form of cash. In addition, through May 15, 2017 (the termination date of the DRIP), the Company had issued approximately 0.1 million shares of common stock under its DRIP, representing approximately $1.2 million of additional proceeds under the Offering.
 
Orchard Securities, LLC (the ‘‘Dealer Manager’’) served as the dealer manager of the Offering through its termination on March 31, 2017.

On March 18, 2016, the Company and its Sponsor entered into the Subordinated Agreement, a subordinated unsecured loan agreement pursuant to which the Sponsor made aggregate principal advances of $12.6 million through March 31, 2017 (the termination date of the Offering). The outstanding principal advances bear interest at a rate of 1.48%, but no interest or principal is due and payable to the Sponsor until holders of the Company’s Common Shares have received liquidation distributions equal to their respective net investments (defined as $10.00 per Common Share) plus a cumulative, pre-tax, non-compounded annual return of 8.0% on their respective net investments.
 
Distributions in connection with a liquidation of the Company initially will be made to holders of its Common Shares until holders of its Common Shares have received liquidation distributions equal to their respective net investments plus a cumulative, pre-tax, non-compounded annual return of 8.0% on their respective net investments. Thereafter, only if additional liquidating distributions are available, the Company will be obligated to repay the outstanding principal advances and related accrued interest to the Sponsor, as described in the Subordinated Agreement. In the event that additional liquidation distributions are available after the Company repays its holders of common stock their respective net investments plus their 8% return on investment and then the outstanding principal advances under the Subordinated Agreement and accrued interest to its Sponsor, such additional distributions will be paid to holders of its Common Shares and its Sponsor: 85.0% of the aggregate amount will be payable to holders of the Company’s Common Shares and the remaining 15.0% will be payable to the Sponsor.
 
The principal advances and the related interest are subordinate to all of the Company’s obligations as well as to the holders of its Common Shares in an amount equal to the shareholder’s net investment plus a cumulative, pre-tax, non-compounded annual return of 8.0% and only potentially payable in the event of a liquidation of the Company.
 
In connection with the termination of the Offering on March 31, 2017, the Company and the Sponsor simultaneously terminated the Subordinated Agreement. As a result of the termination, the Sponsor is no longer obligated to make any additional principal advances to the Company. Interest will continue to accrue on the outstanding principal advances and repayment, if any, of the principal advances and related accrued interest will still be made according to the terms of the Subordinated Agreement disclosed above.
 
As of both December 31, 2018 and 2017, $12.6 million of principal advances were outstanding. The outstanding principal advances, together with the related accrued interest of $445,771 and $258,817 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, are classified as Subordinated advances – related party, a liability, on the consolidated balance sheets. During both of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company accrued $186,954 of interest expense on the principal advances.
 
The Company has and will continue to seek to originate, acquire and manage a diverse portfolio of real estate-related investments, including investments in mezzanine loans, first lien mortgage loans, second lien mortgage loans, bridge loans and preferred equity interests, in each case with a focus on investments intended to finance development or redevelopment opportunities. The Company may also invest in debt and derivative securities related to real estate assets. A substantial portion of the Company’s investments by value may be secured by or related to properties or entities advised by, or wholly or partially, directly or indirectly owned by, the Sponsor, by its affiliates or by real estate investment programs sponsored by it. Although the Company expects that most of its investments will be of these types, it may make other investments. In fact, it may invest in whatever types of real estate-related investments that it believes are in its best interests.
 
The Company has no employees. The Company retains the Advisor to manage its affairs on a day-to-day basis. The Advisor is an affiliate of the Sponsor and will receive compensation and fees for services related to the investment and management of the Company’s assets. The Advisor received fees during the Company’s organization and offering stage and will receive fees during its operational and liquidation/listing stages.
 
The Company’s shares of common stock are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. The Company may seek to list its shares of common stock for trading on a national securities exchange only if a majority of its independent directors believe listing would be in the best interest of its stockholders. The Company does not intend to list its shares of common stock at this time. The Company does not anticipate that there would be any market for its shares of common stock until they are listed for trading. In the event the Company does not begin the process of achieving a liquidity event prior to March 31, 2022 (the fifth anniversary of the termination of our Offering), our charter requires either (a) an amendment to our charter to extend the deadline to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event, or (b) the holding of a stockholders meeting to vote on a proposal for an orderly liquidation of our portfolio.
 
Related Parties
 
Our Advisor and its affiliates are related parties. Certain of these entities received compensation and fees for services related to the Offering and have and will continue to receive compensation and fees and services for the investment of our assets. These entities received fees during our Offering stage and will receive fees during our acquisition, operational and liquidation stages. The compensation levels during our offering stage were based on the percentages of the offering proceeds sold and during our acquisition and operational stages are based on percentages of the cost of acquired properties or other investments and the annual revenue earned from such properties or other investments, and other such fees outlined in each of the respective agreements.

Primary Investment Objectives, Acquisition and Investment Policies
 
Our primary investment objectives are:
 

• | to pay periodic cash distributions to our stockholders as required to maintain our qualification as a REIT; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to preserve and protect our shareholders’ capital contribution.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our strategy is to originate, acquire and manage a diverse portfolio of real estate-related investments secured by or related to properties located primarily in the United States. A majority of our investments by value currently are and we expect will continue to be related-party investments located in large metropolitan areas. We generally have sought to create and maintain a portfolio of investments that either generate or are expected to generate attractive cash distributions. Our focus on investing in debt instruments aligns with primary investment objectives. However, we still may target capital appreciation from our investments.
 
We have not established any limits on the percentage of our portfolio that may be comprised of various categories of assets which present differing levels of risk. The allocation of our assets under management is dependent, in part, upon the then-current commercial real estate market, the investment opportunities it presents and available financing, if any, as well as other micro and macro market conditions.
 
We have and expect to continue to seek to originate, acquire and manage a diverse portfolio of real estate-related investments, including mezzanine loans, first lien mortgage loans, second lien mortgage loans, bridge loans and preferred equity interests, in each case with a focus on investments intended to finance development or redevelopment opportunities. We may also invest in debt and derivative securities related to real estate assets, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”); collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”); debt securities issued by real estate companies; and credit default swaps. We have and expect to continue to focus our origination and acquisition activity on real estate-related investments secured by or related to properties located in the United States, and primarily related-party investments. We sometimes refer to the foregoing types of investments as our targeted investments. We have and will continue to target investments that generally offer predictable current cash flow and/or attractive risk-adjusted returns based on the underwriting criteria established and employed by our Advisor, which includes the anticipated leverage point, market and economic conditions, the location and quality of the underlying collateral and the borrower’s exit or refinancing plan. We believe our ability to continue to execute our investment strategy may be enhanced through access to our Sponsor’s extensive experience in financing real estate projects it has sponsored, as opposed to a strategy that relies solely on buying assets in the open market from third-party originators. We have and will continue to seek to build a portfolio that includes some of or all the following investment characteristics: (a) provides current income; (b) is secured by high-quality commercial real estate; (c) includes subordinate capital investments by strong sponsors that support our investments and provide downside protection; and (d) possesses strong structural features that maximize repayment potential, such as a clear exit or refinancing plan by the borrower.
 
We have and may continue to invest in real estate-related loans and debt securities both by directly originating them and by purchasing them from third-party sellers. Although we generally prefer the benefits of direct origination, situations may arise to purchase real estate-related loans and debt securities, possibly at discounts to par, which compensate for the lack of control or structural enhancements typically associated with directly structured investments.
 
Investments
 
Through December 31, 2018, we have made the following three real estate and real estate-related investments:
 
105-109 W. 28th Street Preferred Investment
 
The Company has entered into an agreement, as amended, with various related party entities that provided for the Company to make aggregate preferred equity contributions (the “105-109 W. 28th Street Preferred Investment”) of up to $37.0 million in an affiliate of its Sponsor (the “Moxy Developer”), which owns a parcel of land located at 105-109 W. 28th Street, New York, New York on which it constructed a 343-room Marriott Moxy hotel, which opened during February 2019. The 105-109 W. 28th Street Preferred Investment was made pursuant to an instrument that entitles the Company to monthly preferred distributions at a rate of 12% per annum and is redeemable by the Company on November 25, 2020. The 105-109 W. 28th Street Preferred Investment is classified as a held-to-maturity security and recorded at cost.
 
As of both December 31, 2018 and 2017, the 105-109 W. 28th Street Preferred Investment had an outstanding balance of $37.0 million, which is classified as an investment in related party on the consolidated balance sheets. During both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded $4.5 million of investment income related to the 105-109 W. 28th Street Preferred Investment.
 
During March 2019, we received aggregate repayments of $13.0 million on our Preferred Investment.

The Cove Joint Venture
 
On January 31, 2017, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, REIT IV COVE LLC along with LSG Cove LLC, an affiliate of the Company’s Sponsor and a related party, REIT III COVE LLC, a subsidiary of the operating partnership of Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc., a real estate investment trust also sponsored by the Company’s Sponsor and a related party and Maximus Cove Investor LLC (“Maximus”), an unrelated third party, completed the acquisition of all of RP Cove, L.L.C’s membership interest in RP Maximus Cove, L.L.C. (the “Cove Joint Venture”) for aggregate consideration of approximately $255.0 million, which consisted of $80.0 million of cash and $175.0 million of proceeds from a loan from a financial institution. The Cove Joint Venture owns and operates The Cove at Tiburon (the “Cove”), a multi-family complex consisting of 281-units, or 289,690 square feet, contained within 32 apartment buildings over 20.1 acres originally constructed in 1967, located in Tiburon, California.
 
In connection with the acquisition, the Company paid the Advisor an acquisition fee of approximately $0.6 million, equal to 1.0% of the Company’s pro-rata share of the contractual purchase price which is reflected in the Company’s carrying value which is included in investments in unconsolidated affiliated real estate entities on the consolidated balance sheets.
 
The Company paid approximately $20.0 million for a 22.5% membership interest in the Cove Joint Venture. The Company’s ownership interest in the Cove Joint Venture is a non-managing interest. The Company has determined that the Cove Joint Venture is a variable interest entity but the Company is not the primary beneficiary. The Company accounts for its ownership interest in the Cove Joint Venture in accordance with the equity method of accounting because it exerts significant influence over but does not control the Cove Joint Venture. All capital contributions and distributions of earnings from the Cove Joint Venture are made on a pro rata basis in proportion to each member’s equity interest percentage. Any distributions in excess of earnings from the Cove Joint Venture are made to the members pursuant to the terms of the Cove Joint Venture’s operating agreement. An affiliate of Maximus is the asset manager of the Cove and receives certain fees as defined in the property management agreement for the management of the Cove. The Company commenced recording its allocated portion of profit/loss and cash distributions beginning as of January 31, 2017 with respect to its membership interest of 22.5% in the Cove Joint Venture.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company made additional capital contributions of $2.2 million to the Cove Joint Venture.
 
In connection with the closing of the Cove Transaction, the Cove Joint Venture simultaneously entered into a $175.0 million loan (the “Loan”) initially scheduled to mature on January 31, 2020 with two, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. The Loan requires monthly interest payments through its maturity date.  The Loan bears interest at Libor plus 3.85% through its initial maturity and Libor plus 4.15% during each of the extension periods. The Loan is collateralized by the Cove and an affiliate of the Company’s Sponsor (the “Guarantor”) has guaranteed the Cove Joint Venture‘s obligation to pay the outstanding balance of the Loan up to approximately $43.8 million (the “Loan Guarantee”). The members have agreed to reimburse the Guarantor for any balance that may become due under the Loan Guarantee, of which the Company’s share is up to approximately $10.9 million.
 
Starting in 2013, the Cove has been undergoing an extensive refurbishment which was substantially completed in 2018. The members have used all of the remaining proceeds from the Loan and also invested additional capital as necessary for the refurbishment. The Guarantor has provided an additional guarantee of up to approximately $13.4 million (the “Refurbishment Guarantee”) to provide any necessary funds to complete the remaining renovations as defined in the Loan. The members have agreed to reimburse the Guarantor for any balance that may become due under the Refurbishment Guarantee, of which the Company’s share is up to approximately $3.3 million.
 
The Company has determined that the fair value of both the Loan Guarantee and the Refurbishment Guarantee are immaterial.
 
40 East End Ave. Joint Venture
 
On March 31, 2017, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement (the “40 East End Ave. Transaction”) with SAYT Master Holdco LLC, an entity majority-owned and controlled by David Lichtenstein, who also majority owns and controls the Company’s Sponsor, and a related party, (the “40 East End Seller”), pursuant to which it acquired 33.3% of the 40 East End Seller’s approximate 100% membership interest in 40 East End Ave. Pref Member LLC ( “40 East End Ave. Joint Venture”) for aggregate consideration of approximately $10.3 million. The Company subsequently made additional capital contributions aggregating $2.6 million to the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture during 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company made additional capital contributions of $1.2 million to the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture.
 
The Company’s ownership interest in the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture is a non-managing interest. Because the Company exerts significant influence over but does not control the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture, it accounts for its ownership interest in the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture in accordance with the equity method of accounting. All contributions to and distributions of earnings from the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture are made on a pro rata basis in proportion to each Member’s equity interest percentage. Any distributions in excess of earnings from the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture are made to the Members pursuant to the terms of its operating agreement. The Company commenced recording its allocated portion of earnings and cash distributions from the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture beginning as of March 31, 2017 with respect to its membership interest of approximately 33.3% in the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture. Additionally, Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. (“Lightstone I”), a real estate investment trust also sponsored by the Company’s Sponsor, has made $30.0 million of preferred equity contributions (the “Preferred Contributions”) to a subsidiary of the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture, pursuant to an instrument that entitles Lightstone I to monthly preferred distributions at a rate of 12% per annum. No distributions may be paid to the Members until the Preferred Contributions are redeemed in full.

The 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture, through affiliates, acquired a parcel of land located at the corner of 81st Street and East End Avenue in the Upper East Side neighborhood of New York City on which it is constructing a luxury residential project consisting of 29 condominium units (the “40 East End Ave. Project”). On March 21, 2017, the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture obtained financing from a financial institution of up to $85.3 million (the “Mortgage Payable”) for the land acquisition and construction of the 40 East End Ave. Project. The Mortgage Payable initially matures on September 21, 2020 but may be further extended one additional year, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The Mortgage Payable bears interest at Libor plus 4.50% (subject to floor of 5.00%) and is collateralized by the 40 East End Ave. Project. During the initial term, the monthly interest due on the Mortgage Payable is funded under the remaining availability under the Mortgage Payable and thereafter, interest is payable monthly and principal payments are required to be made from condominium sales proceeds until the Mortgage Payable is repaid in full. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Payable was approximately $54.1 million and the remaining availability was approximately $31.2 million. The Company’s Sponsor (the “40 East End Guarantor”) has provided certain guarantees with respect to the Mortgage Payable, including a completion guarantee and a carry costs guarantee for the 40 East End Ave. Project. The Members have agreed to reimburse the 40 East End Guarantor for any balance that may become due under the guarantees, of which the Company’s share is 33.3%.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the 40 East End Ave. Project was still under development but has incurred certain selling, general and administrative costs; including marketing/advertising costs and staffing, rent and other costs, and depreciation and amortization expense of furnishing and fixtures related to an off-site sales office, which opened in May 2018. To date, such costs have been fully funded under the Mortgage Payable.
 
Financing Strategy and Policies
 
There is no limitation on the amount we may invest or borrow for the purchase or origination of any single property or investment. Our charter allows us to incur leverage up to 300% of our total “net assets” (as defined in our charter) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally expected to be approximately 75% of the cost of our investments. We may only exceed this 300% limit if a majority of our independent directors approves each borrowing in excess of this limit and we disclose such borrowing to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with a justification for the excess borrowing. In all events, we expect that our secured and unsecured borrowings will be reasonable in relation to the net value of our assets and will be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly.
 
We do not currently intend to exceed the leverage limit in our charter. We believe that careful use of debt helps us to achieve our diversification goals because we may have more funds available for investment. However, high levels of debt could cause us to incur higher interest charges and higher debt service payments, which would decrease the amount of cash available for distribution to our investors.
 
Distribution Objectives
 
U.S. federal income tax law requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”)) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash available.
 
Distributions, if any, are authorized at the discretion of our Board of Directors based on their analysis of our performance over the previous periods and expectations of performance for future periods. Such analyses may include actual and anticipated operating cash flow, capital expenditure needs, general financial and market conditions, proceeds from asset sales and redemptions and other factors that our board of directors deem relevant. Our Board of Directors’ decisions will be substantially influenced by their obligation to ensure that we maintain our federal tax status as a REIT. We may fund distributions with cash proceeds from borrowings if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to fund distributions. Our ability to pay regular distributions and the size of these distributions will depend upon a variety of factors. For example, our borrowing policy permits us to incur short-term indebtedness, having a maturity of two years or less, and we may have to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT. We cannot assure that regular distributions will continue to be made or that we will maintain any particular level of distributions that we have established or may establish.

We are an accrual basis taxpayer, and as such our REIT taxable income could be higher than the cash available to us. We may therefore borrow to make distributions, which could reduce the cash available to us, in order to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income as a condition to our election to be taxed as a REIT. These distributions made with borrowed funds may constitute a return of capital to stockholders. To the extent that distributions to stockholders exceed earnings and profits, such amounts constitute a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but only to the extent of a shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in our shares, although such distributions might not reduce stockholders’ aggregate invested capital. Because our earnings and profits are reduced for depreciation and other non-cash items, it is likely that a portion of each distribution will constitute a tax-deferred return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
On October 28, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized and we declared a distribution rate which is calculated based on stockholders of record each day during the applicable period at a rate of $0.002191781 per day, and equals a daily amount that, if paid each day for a 365-day period, would equal a 8.0% annualized rate based on a share price of $10.00. Our first distribution began to accrue on June 12, 2015 (date of breaking escrow for our Offering) through November 30, 2015 (the end of the month following our initial real estate-related investment) and our subsequent distributions have been on a monthly basis thereafter. Our first distribution was paid on December 15, 2015 and subsequent distributions have been paid on or about the 15th day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business on the last day of the prior month. However, there can be no assurances that our Board of Directors will authorize and we will declare future distributions at any particular level or frequency.
 
Total distributions declared during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were approximately $7.0 million and $6.8 million, respectively.
 
Distribution Reinvestment and Share Repurchase Programs
 
On April 21, 2017, our Board of Directors approved the termination of the DRIP effective May 15, 2017. Previously, our stockholders had an option to elect the receipt of shares of our common stock in lieu of cash distributions under the DRIP, however, all future distributions, if any, will be in the form of cash. In addition, through May 15, 2017 (the termination date of the DRIP), we issued approximately 0.1 million shares of common stock under the DRIP, representing approximately $1.2 million of additional proceeds under the Offering.
 
Our DRIP provided our stockholders with an opportunity to purchase additional shares of our common stock at a discount by reinvesting distributions. The Offering provided for 10.0 million shares available for issuance under our DRIP which were offered at a discounted price equivalent to 95% of our Primary Offering price per Common Share. Through May 15, 2017 (the termination date of the DRIP), 128,554 shares of common stock had been issued under our DRIP, which is now terminated.
 
Our share repurchase program may provide our stockholders with limited, interim liquidity by enabling them to sell their shares of common stock back to us, subject to restrictions. From our date of inception through December 31, 2016, we repurchased 18,798 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $9.75 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2017 we repurchased 20,236 shares of common stock, pursuant to our share repurchase program at an average price per share of $9.71 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2018 we repurchased 286,870 shares of common stock, pursuant to our share repurchase program at an average price per share of $9.38 per share. We funded share repurchases for the periods noted above from the cumulative proceeds of the sale of our shares pursuant to our DRIP, (prior to its termination) and available cash on hand.
 
Our Board of Directors may amend the terms of our share repurchase program without stockholder approval upon at least 30 days’ written notice to all stockholders. Our Board of Directors also is free to suspend or terminate the program upon at least 30 days’ written notice to all stockholders or to reject any request for repurchase and there is no assurance our Board of Directors will not suspend or terminate the program or reject requests for repurchases.
 
Tax Status
 
We elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2016. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. To maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”), we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT in any subsequent year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at the regular corporate rate, and we may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify as a REIT. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no material uncertain income tax positions. Additionally, even if we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income taxes and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
 
Market Overview and Opportunity
 
We believe that the market for investment in real estate-related investments secured by or related to real estate located primarily in the United States continues to be compelling from a risk-return perspective. We have and intend primarily to continue to focus on investing in development or redevelopment opportunities because, since the economic dislocation that occurred in the United States from approximately 2007–10, demand for development and or redevelopment projects has increased; funding sources to fund such projects have not kept pace with demand; and traditional lenders have tightened lending standards, making it difficult for developers to obtain traditional financing.
 
We favor a strategy weighted toward targeting debt investments that balance current income with significant subordinate capital and downside structural protections. We believe that our investment strategy, combined with the experience and expertise of our Advisor’s management team, provides opportunities to: (a) originate loans with attractive current returns and strong structural features directly with borrowers, thereby taking advantage of market conditions in order to seek the best risk-return dynamic for our stockholders; and (b) purchase real estate-related investments from third parties, in some instances at discounts to their face amounts (or par value). We believe the combination of these strategies and the application of prudent leverage to our investments may also allow us to (i) realize appreciation opportunities in the portfolio and (ii) diversify our capital and enhance returns.
 
Environmental
 
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of U.S. federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.
Employees
 
We do not have employees. We entered into an advisory agreement with our Advisor pursuant to which our Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day operations and selects our real estate and real estate related investments, subject to oversight by our Board of Directors. We pay our Advisor fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets, and we have and expect to continue to reimburse our Advisor for certain expenses incurred on our behalf.
Economic Dependence
 
We were initially dependent upon the net proceeds received from the Offering and principal advances from our Sponsor made under the Subordinated Agreement to conduct our proposed activities.
