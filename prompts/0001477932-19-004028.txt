Industry Background:

Non-alcoholic beverages are among the most widely distributed food products in the world and are being sold through more than 400,000 retailers in the United States, our core market. The United States has more than 2,600 beverage companies and 500 bottlers of beverage products. Collectively they account for more than $100 billion in annual sales. It is estimated that globally more than $300 billion worth of non-alcoholic beverages are sold annually. The beverage market is controlled by two giants, The Coca-Cola Company (“Coke”) and PepsiCo, combining for over 70% of the non-alcoholic beverage market. The demand for “better-for you” and functional drinks are two of the fastest growing beverage categories. 

Since the signing of the 2018 Farm Bill, there has been a significant boost in CBD store fronts, both brick and mortar, and online retailers across the country. According to recent 3rd party reports, the hemp-derived CBD market is expected to reach sales of $22 billion by 2022, outpacing cannabis sales, and surging from $591 million in 2018.

Distribution Systems:

Our distribution strategy will be comprised of traditional beverage distribution through established channels.

Direct Store Delivery (“DSD”) - DSD players, and regional and local distributors touch over 90% of retail chains in the US. DSDs primarily distribute beverages, chips, snacks and milk and provide pre-sales, delivery and merchandising services to their customers. Service levels are daily and weekly and they require 25% to 30% gross profit from sales to their customers. We will grant these independent distributors the exclusive right in defined territories to distribute finished cases of one or more of our products through written agreements. These agreements typically include compensation to those distributors in the event we provide product directly to one of our regional retailers located in the distributor’s region. We will choose our distributors based on their perceived ability to build our brand franchise in convenience stores and grocery stores.

Direct to Retail Channel (“Warehouse Direct”) - We are targeting listings with large retail convenience store and grocery store chains where we ship direct to the chain stores warehousing system. Retailers must have warehousing and delivery capabilities. Services to retailers will be provided by an assigned broker, approved by us, to oversee pre-sale and merchandising services. Our direct to retail channel of distribution is an important part of our strategy to target large national or regional restaurant chains, retail accounts, including mass merchandisers and premier food-service businesses. Through these programs, we will negotiate directly with the retailer to carry our products, and the account is serviced through the retailer’s appointed distribution system. These arrangements are terminable at any time by these retailers or us and will contain no minimum purchase commitments.

Production Facilities:

Our strategy is to outsource the manufacturing and warehousing of our products to independent contract manufacturers (“co-packers”). We will purchase our raw materials from North American suppliers which deliver to our third-party co-packers. We will use two or more co-packers to manufacture and package our products. Once our products are manufactured, we store finished product in a warehouse adjacent to each co-packer or in third party warehouses. Our copackers will be chosen based on their proximity to markets covered by our distributors. Most of the ingredients used in the formulation of our products are off-the shelf and thus readily available. No ingredient has a lead time greater than two weeks. Other than minimum case volume requirements per production run for most co-packers, we will not have annual minimum production commitments with our co-packers. Our co-packers may terminate their arrangements with us at any time, in which case we could experience disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers. We will continually review our contract packing needs considering regulatory compliance and logistical requirements and may add or change co-packers based on those needs.

Raw Materials:

Substantially all the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our products will be purchased by us or by our contract manufacturers in accordance with our specifications. The raw materials used in the preparation and packaging of our products will consist primarily of juice concentrates, natural flavors, stevia, pure cane sugar, bottles, labels, trays and enclosures. These raw materials will be purchased from suppliers selected by us or by our contract manufacturers. We believe that we have adequate sources of raw materials, which are available from multiple suppliers.

We will purchase our flavor concentrate from several flavor concentrate suppliers. Generally, all natural flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to the flavors. Independent suppliers bear a large portion of the expense for the development of new products and flavors, thereby enabling us to develop new products and flavors at relatively low cost. 

New Product Development:

Our product philosophy will continue to be based on developing products in those segments of the market that offer the greatest chance of success such as health, wellness and natural refreshment and rehydration, and we will continue to seek out underserved market niches. We believe we can quickly respond, , to changing market conditions with new and innovative products. We are committed to developing products that are distinct, meet a quantifiable need, are proprietary, lend themselves to at least a 30% gross profit, project a quality and healthy image, and can be distributed through existing distribution channels. We are identifying brands of other companies with a view to acquiring them or taking on the exclusive distribution of their products.
Intellectual Property:

We own the following intellectual property: - Good Hemp® trademark, Good Hemp 2oh! And Good Hemp fizz! beverage formulations.

Seasonality:

Our sales are expected to be seasonal and experience fluctuations in quarterly results because of many factors. Historically, the industry experiences an increase in revenues during the warm weather months of April through September. Timing of customer purchases will vary each year and sales can be expected to shift from one quarter to another. Thus, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance or results expected for the entire fiscal year.
Emerging Growth Company Status:

We are an “emerging growth company” as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, commonly referred to as the JOBS Act. We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.

As an “emerging growth company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to:


· | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (we also will not be subject to the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) as long as we are a “smaller reporting company,” which includes issuers that had a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of their most recently completed second fiscal quarter);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and 
· | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 


In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Under this provision, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of such accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies until the first to occur of the date the subject company (i) is no longer an “emerging growth company” or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in Securities Act Section 7(a) (2) (B). The Company has elected to take advantage of this extended transition period and, as a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. Accordingly, until the date that we are no longer an “emerging growth company” or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption provided by Securities Act Section 7(a) (2) (B), upon the issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to your financial statements and has a different effective date for public and private companies, clarify that we will disclose the date on which adoption is required for non-emerging growth companies and the date on which we will adopt the recently issued accounting standard.
