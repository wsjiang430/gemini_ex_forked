General
Express is a leading fashion destination and apparel brand for both women and men. Since 1980, Express has provided the latest apparel and accessories for work, casual, jeanswear, and going-out, offering a distinct combination of fashion and quality at an attractive value.
As of February 2, 2019, we operated 631 stores across the United States and in Puerto Rico, including 184 factory outlet stores. Our stores are located primarily in high-traffic shopping malls, lifestyle centers, outlet centers, and street locations, and average approximately 8,500 gross square feet. We also sell our products through our e-commerce website, www.express.com, and our mobile app, as well as through franchisees who operate Express locations in Latin America pursuant to the franchise agreements. Our 2018 merchandise sales were comprised of approximately 61% women's merchandise and approximately 39% men's merchandise. 
Competition and Competitive Strengths
The apparel retail market is highly competitive. We compete with other brick-and-mortar and e-commerce retailers that engage in the retail sale of women's and men's apparel, accessories, and similar merchandise. We compete on the basis of a combination of factors, including, among others, style, breadth, quality, and price of merchandise offered, in-store and online customer experience, and brand image. 
We believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors as follows:
Established Lifestyle Brand. With nearly 40 years of heritage, the Express brand represents a distinct fashion point of view, outfitting ambitious, driven individuals who inspire others to level up through their personal style. Express has the fashion, fit, quality and sizes for every moment and milestone in their lives, getting them ready for what’s next. The Express brand differentiates itself by offering 1) a balanced assortment of core styles and the latest fashions; 2) products that address fashion needs across multiple wearing occasions, including work, casual, jeanswear, and going-out; and 3) quality products at an attractive value.
Data Driven Processes. Our data driven processes allow us to test our merchandise in select stores and online before placing orders for our broader store base. In addition, we assess sales data on a weekly basis in order to make in-season inventory adjustments where possible, which allows us to respond to the latest trends. We have an efficient, diversified, and flexible supply chain, including a network of buying agents and third-party manufacturers located throughout the world that allows us to quickly identify and respond to trends and bring a tested assortment of high quality products at competitive prices to our stores. 
Strong and Tenured Team. We are currently conducting a search for a new Chief Executive Officer and other leadership roles. Our existing team, at and below the leadership level, has extensive experience in the retail apparel industry, including depth in the areas of fashion design and merchandising, supply chain, marketing, customer experience, e-commerce, store operations, technology, planning and allocation, and real estate, as well as other diverse business experiences that we believe are valuable to us as we continue to execute our growth strategy. Experience and tenure within Express extends deep into our organization, including district and store managers. 
Our future success will depend on our ability to maintain these strengths, offer compelling merchandise at an attractive value, provide an exceptional omni-channel customer experience, maintain the strength and increase awareness of the Express brand, and retain and acquire customers.
Our Products 
The majority of our apparel designs are created by our in-house design team, and we believe we have developed a portfolio of apparel products that have significant brand value, including the Editor pant and 1MX shirt. We focus on providing our

customers with attractively-priced merchandise that is well-constructed and made from quality materials that are designed to last for several seasons, and believe our customers value our consistent fits and detailing. 
We plan our product assortments and display them in our stores and online in a coordinated manner to encourage our customers to purchase multi-item outfits as opposed to individual items. We believe this allows us to better meet our customers' shopping objectives while differentiating our product offerings from competitors. On average, our customers purchase two to three items per transaction. We monitor cross-selling trends in order to optimize our in-store and online product assortment. 
Omni-Channel Customer Experience
We are committed to creating an omni-channel customer experience that offers a seamless shopping experience whether the customer is shopping in a store or online through a desktop, tablet, or mobile device. We believe the lines between our store and e-commerce channels are disappearing as customers increasingly interact with us both in-store and online and often through mobile devices while in stores. As a result, we are focused on leveraging the best of both channels to create an exceptional omni-channel shopping experience. 
We design our stores to create a distinctive and engaging shopping environment and project our image of Express as a fashion authority for our target demographic. Our stores feature a vibrant and youthful look, bright signage, and popular music. Our stores are constructed and finished to allow us to efficiently shift merchandise displays throughout the year as seasons dictate. To further enhance our customers' experience, we seek to attract enthusiastic store associates who are committed to offering a high level of customer service. We believe our managers and associates deliver a superior shopping experience as a result of the training we provide, the culture of accountability we foster, the incentives we offer, and the decision-making authority we grant to store managers. On average, our store managers have been with Express for over five years.
Similar to our stores, our e-commerce capabilities focus on creating an engaging and easy shopping experience that supports a vibrant, young fashion consumer, whether on a mobile device, tablet, or at a desktop, with a particular focus on mobile. We recognize the growing preference for online shopping and continue to make enhancements to the online customer experience through improved search, site navigation and checkout capabilities, and targeted customer messaging, making shopping easier for customers. 
In 2018, we continued to expand our omni-channel capabilities by further rolling out ship-from-store to a total of approximately 400 stores. Ship-from-store allows us to ship merchandise from select stores directly to the customer. In addition, we further piloted "buy-online-pickup-in-store" which allows customers to order online and pick up at certain Express stores. We believe that these expanded capabilities will enhance the overall customer experience and have a positive impact on our business, including sales, margins, and inventory productivity. 
Marketing
We use a variety of marketing vehicles designed to acquire new customers, engage with existing customers, increase customer traffic in-store and online, and build brand loyalty. These include direct mail, e-mail communications, promotional offers, social media, print, television, digital advertising, celebrity brand ambassador campaigns, arrangements with social influencers and bloggers, in-store visuals, earned media mentions, and other features through public relations activities. 
We use a proprietary customer database, together with data analytics, to customize our communications and make targeted offers to customers in an effort to increase customer traffic in-store and online and to increase conversion. In addition, we offer a customer loyalty program, Express NEXT, which allows customers to earn rewards for purchases and offers other incentives to engage with the Express brand. We also offer a private-label credit card through an agreement (the "Card Agreement") with Comenity Bank (the “Bank”) under which the Bank owns the credit card accounts and Alliance Data Systems Corporation provides services to our private-label credit card customers. All of our proprietary credit cards carry the Express logo. We believe that our loyalty and credit card programs encourage frequent store and website visits, promote multiple-item purchases, and cultivate customer loyalty to the Express brand. 
Technology 
We rely on information technology to operate our business. Our information technology provides a full range of business process support and information to our store, e-commerce, merchandising, financial, and real estate teams. We utilize a combination of customized and industry standard software systems to provide various functions related to point-of-sale, inventory management, design, planning and allocation, and financial reporting. Over the past few years, we launched multiple system upgrades, including a new order management system, a new retail management system, and a new enterprise planning system to further enhance our omni-channel capabilities. We believe these new systems allow us to increase speed-to-market, 
5

conduct planning and allocation with more precision, and ultimately give us the ability to maximize inventory productivity and reduce markdowns over time. 
Sourcing 
Our Sourcing Methods 
We utilize a broad base of manufacturers located throughout the world that we believe produce goods at the level of quality that our customers desire, and can supply products to us on a timely basis at competitive prices. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and, as a result, contract with third-party vendors for the production of all of our merchandise. We purchase both apparel and accessories through buying agents and directly from vendors. In exchange for a commission, our buying agents identify suitable vendors and coordinate our purchasing requirements with vendors by placing orders for merchandise on our behalf, ensuring the timely delivery of goods to us, obtaining samples of merchandise produced in factories, inspecting finished merchandise, and carrying out vendor compliance monitoring and administrative communications on our behalf.
We purchase the majority of our merchandise outside of the United States through arrangements with approximately 89 vendors utilizing approximately 315 manufacturing facilities located in approximately 24 countries throughout the world, primarily in Asia. The top five countries from which we sourced our merchandise in 2018 were Vietnam, China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and India, based on total cost of merchandise purchased. The top 10 manufacturing facilities, based on cost, supplied approximately 25% of our merchandise in 2018. We purchase merchandise using purchase orders, and therefore are not subject to long-term production contracts with any vendors, manufacturers, or buying agents. 
Quality Assurance and Compliance Monitoring 
Each supplier, factory, and subcontractor that manufactures our merchandise is required to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct and certain other purchasing terms and conditions, including those related to product quality. This is designed to ensure that each of our suppliers' operations are conducted in a legal, ethical, and responsible manner. Our Code of Vendor Conduct requires that each of our suppliers provides minimum wages and benefits, limits working hours, complies with all laws, including environmental laws, and provides a safe and healthy work environment. It also forbids the use of child labor or forced labor, and prohibits unauthorized subcontracting. We monitor compliance through third parties who conduct regular factory audits on our behalf as well as through our buying agents. 
Distribution
We utilize two facilities for the distribution of our product, both of which are owned and operated by third parties. Virtually all of the merchandise sold in our stores and on our website is first received and processed at a central distribution facility in Columbus, Ohio. From there, merchandise allocated to be sold in stores is shipped to our stores and merchandise to be sold online direct-to-consumer is shipped to a distribution facility in Richwood, Kentucky (the "Richwood Facility"). Merchandise is typically shipped to such stores and to the Richwood Facility via third-party delivery services multiple times per week, thereby providing them with a steady flow of inventory. The third party who operates the Richwood Facility is responsible for fulfilling the majority of the orders placed through our website and shipping the merchandise directly to customers or to stores for pickup, via third-party delivery services. In addition, approximately 400 retail stores have the ability to ship select online merchandise directly to our customers.

Intellectual Property 
The Express trademark and certain variations thereon, such as Express World Brand, are registered or are subject to pending trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and/or with the registries of many foreign countries. In addition, we own domain names for many of our trademarks, including express.com. We believe our material trademarks have significant value, and we vigorously protect them against infringement.
Regulation and Legislation 
We are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations, including minimum wage requirements, intellectual property laws, consumer protection laws and regulations, including those governing advertising and promotions, privacy, and product safety, and laws and regulations with respect to the operation of our stores and business generally, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and laws that apply as a result of being a public company. In addition, we are subject to United States customs laws and similar laws of other countries associated with the import and export of merchandise. 
Employees 
We currently employ approximately 15,700 employees. Approximately 1,000 employees are based at our home office locations in either Columbus or New York City, approximately 60 are field-based regional and district managers, approximately 1,600
7

are in-store managers or co-managers, and approximately 13,100 are in-store sales associates. Approximately 20% and 80% of our associates are full-time and part-time, respectively. None of our employees are represented by a union, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe our relations with our employees are good. 
Seasonality 
Our business is seasonal. We define our seasons as Spring, which includes the first and second quarters, and Fall, which includes the third and fourth quarters. Historically, we have realized a higher portion of our net sales and net income in the Fall season due primarily to the impact of the holiday season. In 2018, approximately 54% of our net sales were generated in the Fall season, while approximately 46% were generated in the Spring season. Cash needs are typically higher in the third quarter due to inventory-related working capital requirements for early Fall and holiday selling periods. Our business is also subject, at certain times, to calendar shifts, which may occur during key selling periods close to holidays such as Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. 
Corporate History 
We opened our first store in 1980, in Chicago, Illinois as a division of The Limited, Inc., now known as L Brands, Inc., and launched our men’s apparel line in 1987, which was rebranded under the name Structure in 1989. In 2001, we began to consolidate our separate women’s and men’s stores into combined dual-gender stores under the Express brand. In 2007, Golden Gate Capital acquired 75% of the equity interests in our business from an affiliate of Limited Brands, Inc., and we began to operate as a standalone company. In May 2010, the Company converted to a Delaware corporation, held an initial public offering, and listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Subsequent to our initial public offering, Golden Gate Capital and Limited Brands, Inc. sold their remaining interests in the Company and are no longer affiliated with Express.
