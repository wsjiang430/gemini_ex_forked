Item 1. | Business

General
The Corporation is a Pennsylvania corporation, organized in 1973 and registered as a bank holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. Effective January 1, 2019, the name of the Corporation was changed from Univest Corporation of Pennsylvania to Univest Financial Corporation. The Corporation owns all of the capital stock of Univest Bank and Trust Co. (the Bank). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank. The Corporation’s and the Bank’s legal headquarters are located at 14 North Main Street, Souderton, PA 18964. At December 31, 2018, the Corporation had total assets of $5.0 billion, net loans and leases of $4.0 billion, total deposits of $3.9 billion and total shareholders’ equity of $624.1 million.
The Bank is a Pennsylvania state-chartered bank and trust company. As a state-chartered member bank of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is regulated primarily by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. 
The Bank is engaged in domestic banking services for individuals, businesses, municipalities and non-profit organizations. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Bank provides a variety of financial services throughout its markets of operation. Effective January 1, 2019, the Bank's wealth management segment was re-branded under the Girard name with associated name changes of several subsidiaries while continuing to provide fiduciary services, investment management, and financial and retirement planning. The Bank is the parent company of Girard Investment Services, LLC (formerly Univest Investments, Inc.), a full-service registered broker-dealer and a licensed insurance agency, Girard Advisory Services, LLC (formerly Girard Partners Ltd.), a registered investment advisory firm, Girard Pension Services, LLC (formerly TCG Investment Advisory, Inc.), a registered investment advisor,

which provides investment consulting and management services to municipal entities. Girard Investments has two offices in Pennsylvania. Girard Advisory Services is headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania with a satellite office in Florida. The Bank is also the parent company of Univest Insurance, LLC, an independent insurance agency and Univest Capital, Inc., an equipment financing business. Univest Insurance has three offices in Pennsylvania and one in Maryland. The Bank's former subsidiary, Delview, Inc. was dissolved effective January 1, 2019.
At December 31, 2018, the Corporation has three reportable business segments: Banking, Wealth Management and Insurance. The Corporation determines its segments based primarily upon product and service offerings, through the types of income generated and the regulatory environment. This is strategically how the Corporation operates and has positioned itself in the marketplace. Accordingly, significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of each of these segments. For more detailed discussion and financial information on the business segments, see Note 22, “Segment Reporting” included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under Item 8.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, the Corporation and its subsidiaries employed approximately 841 individuals. None of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and the Corporation believes it enjoys good relations with its personnel.
Market Area
The Corporation is headquartered in Souderton, Pennsylvania, which is located in Southeastern Pennsylvania, approximately thirty-five miles north of Philadelphia. The Corporation provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in Bucks, Berks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, Lehigh, Montgomery, Northampton and Philadelphia counties in Pennsylvania and Atlantic and Cape May counties in New Jersey. The highest concentration of our deposits and loans are in Montgomery and Bucks counties where twenty-four out of our thirty-nine financial centers are located. The acquisition of Fox Chase Bancorp (Fox Chase) on July 1, 2016 expanded the Corporation's presence in Montgomery, Bucks, Philadelphia, and Chester counties in Pennsylvania and into Cape May County in New Jersey. During 2017, the Corporation opened a financial center in Northampton County and three financial centers in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. During 2018, the Corporation opened an additional financial center in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.
Montgomery and Bucks counties are two of the wealthiest counties in Pennsylvania. Significant types of employment industries include pharmaceuticals, health care, electronics, computer services, insurance, industrial machinery, retail, schools and universities and meat processing. Major companies throughout the two counties include Merck and Company, Abington Hospital-Jefferson Health, SmithKline Beecham, Hatfield Quality Meats, St. Mary Medical Center, Giant Food Stores LLC, Doylestown Hospital, Grand View Health, Central Bucks School District, Pennsbury School District and Northtec LLC. Unemployment rates at December 2018 were 3.1% in Montgomery County and 3.4% in Bucks County, lower than Pennsylvania’s state unemployment rate of 4.0% and the federal unemployment rate of 3.7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
The Corporation ranks fifth in deposit market share in Montgomery County with thirteen financial centers and sixth in Bucks County with eleven financial centers, with 6.4% of total combined deposit market share in the two counties according to data provided by SNL Financial. Montgomery County’s population has grown 4% to 832,000 from the year 2010 to 2019, and is expected to grow another 1.9% through 2024, while Bucks County’s population has increased 0.7% to 630,000 during the same period, and is expected to grow 0.7% through 2024, according to SNL Financial. The median age is 41 years and 44 years in Montgomery and Bucks counties, respectively, consistent with the median age of 41 years in Pennsylvania and slightly higher than the median age in the United States of 38 years. County estimates project the median age to increase over the next two decades. The median yearly household income was $91,000 for Montgomery County and $87,000 for Bucks County during 2018 and is expected to increase 7% for Montgomery County and 7% for Bucks County through 2024, according to SNL Financial. The yearly median income for both counties is well above that of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania of $62,000 and the United States at $63,000 during 2018. 
Competition
The Corporation’s service areas are characterized by intense competition for banking business among commercial banks, savings institutions and other financial institutions. In competing with other banks, savings institutions and other financial institutions, the Bank seeks to provide personalized services and local decision making through management’s knowledge and awareness of its service area, customers and borrowers.
Other competitors, including credit unions, consumer finance companies, insurance companies, wealth management providers, leasing companies, financial technology companies and mutual funds, compete with certain lending and deposit gathering services

and insurance and wealth management services offered by the Bank and its operating segments.
Supervision and Regulation
The financial services industry in the United States, particularly entities that are chartered as banks, is highly regulated by federal and state laws that limit the types of businesses in which banks and their holding companies may engage, and which impose significant operating requirements and limitations on banking entities. The discussion below is only a brief summary of some of the significant laws and regulations that affect the Bank and the Corporation, and is not intended to be a complete description of all such laws. 
The Bank is subject to supervision and is regularly examined by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The Bank is also subject to examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
The Corporation is a registered bank holding company, subject to the provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Corporation is subject to the reporting requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board); and the Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, is subject to examination by the Board. The Federal Reserve Act limits the amount of credit that a member bank may extend to its affiliates, and the amount of its funds that it may invest in or lend on the collateral of the securities of its affiliates. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, insured banks are subject to the same limitations.
The Corporation is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). SOX adopted new standards of corporate governance and imposed additional requirements on the board of directors and management of public companies. SOX also requires that the chief executive officer and chief financial officer certify the accuracy of periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Pursuant to Section 404 of SOX (SOX 404), management of the Corporation is required to furnish a report on internal control over financial reporting, identify any material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting and assert that such internal controls are effective. The Corporation has continued to be in compliance with SOX 404 during 2018. The Corporation must maintain effective internal controls, which requires an on-going commitment by management and oversight by the Corporation’s Audit Committee. The process has and will continue to require substantial resources in both financial costs and human capital.
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act).
The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes in the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies such as:

• | Centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by the creation of a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, that has rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws;


• | Increased the FDIC assessment for depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, changed the basis for determining FDIC premiums from insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital and increased the minimum reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund to 1.35% by September 30, 2020. On September 30, 2018, the deposit insurance fund reserve ratio reached 1.36%, exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35%, ahead of the target date of September 30, 2020. The FDIC will not be lowering rates until a target ratio of 2.0% is reached. The FDIC will be giving small banks credits for their portion of assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%.


• | Permanently increased the federal deposit insurance coverage to $250 thousand and increased the Securities Investor Protection Corporation protection from $100 thousand to $250 thousand;


• | Provided for new disclosures and other requirements relating to executive compensation, proxy access by shareholders and corporate governance;


• | Provided for mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer’s ability to repay, restricting variable-rate lending by requiring the ability to repay be determined for variable-rate loans by using the maximum rate that will apply during the first five years of a variable-rate loan term, and making more loans subject to provisions for higher cost loans, new disclosures, and certain other revisions; and

• | Created a financial stability oversight council responsible for recommending to the Federal Reserve increasingly strict rules for capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity.

Basel III
In July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final rules revising the agencies’ capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules, designed to enhance such requirements and implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly referred to as Basel III. Basel III generally implements higher minimum capital requirements, adds a common equity Tier 1 capital requirement, and establishes criteria that instruments must meet to be considered common equity Tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital or Tier 2 capital. The minimum capital to risk-adjusted assets requirements include a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% (6.5% to be considered “well capitalized”) and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, increased from 4.0% (and increased from 6.0% to 8.0% to be considered “well capitalized”); the total capital ratio remains at 8.0% under the rules (10.0% to be considered “well capitalized”). Under BASEL III, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets. BASEL III permits institutions, other than certain large institutions, to elect to continue to treat most components of accumulated other comprehensive income as permitted under the current general risk-based capital rules, and not reflect these items in common equity Tier 1 calculations (such as unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income attributed to defined benefit retirement plans resulting from the initial and subsequent application of the relevant U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges related to items that are reported on the balance sheet at fair value). The minimum capital requirements were effective on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirements were phased in beginning January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2019. See Note 20, "Regulatory Matters" included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under Item 8 for further discussion. 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On December 22, 2017, H.R.1, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was signed into law. The TCJA includes many provisions that affect the Corporation's income tax expense, including a reduction of the Corporation's federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the rate reduction, the Corporation was required to re-measure, through income tax expense in the period of enactment, the deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted rate at which they were expected to be recovered or settled. The re-measurement of the Corporation's net deferred tax asset resulted in additional 2017 income tax expense of $1.1 million. The Corporation completed the calculations of provisional items with the completion of the 2017 tax returns. The impact of the completed calculations to the re-measurement of the Corporation's net deferred tax asset resulted in an income tax benefit of $300 thousand which the Corporation recorded in 2018. See Note 11, "Income Taxes" included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under Item 8 for further discussion.
Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act
On May 24, 2018, President Trump signed into law the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the Act), which was designed to ease certain restrictions imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. Most of the changes made by the Act can be grouped into five general areas: mortgage lending; certain regulatory relief for “community” banks; enhanced consumer protections in specific areas, including subjecting credit reporting agencies to additional requirements; certain regulatory relief for large financial institutions, including increasing the threshold at which institutions are classified a systemically important financial institutions (from $50 billion to $250 billion) and therefore subject to stricter oversight, and revising the rules for larger institution stress testing; and certain changes to federal securities regulations designed to promote capital formation. Some of the key provisions of the Act as it relates to community banks and bank holding companies include, but are not limited to: (i) designating mortgages held in portfolio as “qualified mortgages” for banks with less than $10 billion in assets, subject to certain documentation and product limitations; (ii) exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets from Volcker Rule requirements relating to proprietary trading; (iii) simplifying capital calculations for banks with less than $10 billion in assets by requiring federal banking agencies to establish a community bank leverage ratio of tangible equity to average consolidated assets of a ratio between 8% and 10%, and provide that banks that maintain tangible equity in excess of such ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with risk-based capital and leverage requirements; (iv) assisting smaller banks with obtaining stable funding by providing an exception for reciprocal deposits from FDIC restrictions on acceptance of brokered deposits; (v) raising the eligibility for use of short-form Call Reports from $1 billion to $5 billion in assets; and (vi) clarifying definitions pertaining to high volatility commercial real estate loans which require higher capital allocations, so that only loans with increased risk are subject to higher risk weightings. The Corporation continues to analyze the changes implemented by the Act, but does not believe that such changes will materially impact the Corporation’s business, operations, or financial results.

SEC Disclosure Update and Simplification
On August 17, 2018, the SEC issued Release No. 33-10532, "Disclosure Update and Simplification." This rule amends certain disclosure requirements that were redundant with or superseded by other SEC disclosure requirements or U.S. GAAP or for changes in the information environment. The changes are generally expected to reduce or eliminate some of a SEC registrant's disclosures in certain topics but some provisions require additional disclosures. The rule extends to interim periods the annual disclosure requirement under Regulation S-X of presenting changes in shareholders' equity for the current and comparative year-to-date interim periods. Under the amendments, an analysis of changes in each caption of shareholders' equity presented in the balance sheet must be provided in a note or separate statement. The analysis should include a reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance for each period for which a statement of comprehensive income is required to be filed. The amendments are effective on November 5, 2018. The Corporation currently includes year-to-date changes in shareholders' equity in the Form 10-Q and will additionally provide the quarterly changes in shareholders' equity in the Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2019. The Corporation continues to analyze the amended disclosure requirements under this rule, but does not believe that such changes will materially impact the Corporation’s disclosures.
Wealth Management and Insurance Businesses
The Corporation's wealth management and insurance businesses are subject to additional regulatory requirements. The securities brokerage activities of Girard Investment Services, LLC are subject to regulation by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. Girard Advisory Services, LLC and Girard Pension Services, LLC are registered investment advisory firms which are subject to regulation by the SEC. Univest Insurance, LLC is subject to Pennsylvania insurance laws and the regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance. 
Credit and Monetary Policies
The Bank is affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. An important function of these policies is to curb inflation and control recessions through control of the supply of money and credit. The Board uses its powers to regulate reserve requirements of member banks, the discount rate on member-bank borrowings, interest rates on time and savings deposits of member banks, and to conduct open-market operations in United States Government securities to exercise control over the supply of money and credit. The policies have a direct effect on the amount of bank loans and deposits and on the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits, with the result that the policies have a material effect on bank earnings. Future policies of the Board and other authorities cannot be predicted, nor can their effect on future bank earnings.
The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLBanks), which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks, and is subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The FHLBanks provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. The Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLB), is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB. At December 31, 2018, the Bank owned $13.6 million in FHLB capital stock.
Acquisitions
The Corporation, through its business segments, provide financial solutions to individuals, businesses, municipalities and non-profit organizations. The Corporation prides itself on being a financial organization that continues to increase its scope of services while maintaining traditional beliefs and a determined commitment to the communities it serves. Over the past five years, the Corporation and its subsidiaries have experienced stable growth, both organically and through various acquisitions, to be the best integrated financial solutions provider in the market.
