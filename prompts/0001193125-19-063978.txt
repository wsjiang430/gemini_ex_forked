Item 1. Business 
BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, acquiring, developing and commercializing next generation immunotherapy platforms that leverage cell- and gene-based therapies to treat patients with cancer. We are developing two immuno-oncology platform technologies that utilize the patients immune system by employing novel, controlled gene expression and innovative cell engineering technologies to designed deliver safe, effective, and scalable cell- and viral-based therapies for the treatment of multiple cancer types. Our first platform is referred to as Sleeping Beauty and is based on the genetic engineering of immune cells using a non-viral transposon/transposase system to stably reprogram T cells outside of the body for subsequent infusion. Our second platform is termed Controlled IL-12, which is designed to stimulate expression of interleukin 12, or IL-12, a master regulator of the immune system, in a controlled and safe manner to focus the patients immune system to attack cancer cells. We believe these two platforms will provide unique and powerful solutions to address the issues associated with (1) treating solid tumors with heterogeneous and unknown antigens, and (2) providing cost-effective scalable manufacturing solutions for T-cell receptor T-cell, or TCR+ T, and chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR T-cell, or CAR+ T, therapies for solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. We expect programs from our two platform technologies to be in the clinic in 2019. 
 Immuno-oncology, which typically utilizes a patients own immune system to treat cancer, is one of the most actively pursued areas of research by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies today. Cancer cells often contain new mutated proteins and may overexpress other proteins usually found in the body. The immune system typically recognizes unusual or aberrant cell protein expression and eliminates these cells in an efficient process known as immune surveillance. Central to immune surveillance are types of white blood cells known as T cells. In healthy individuals, T cells can identify and kill infected or abnormal cells, including cancer cells. Malignant cells develop the ability to evade immune surveillance, which is a key factor in their growth, spread, and persistence. 
 Our approach to immuno-oncology entails the application of engineering principles to biological systems for designing and constructing new biological systems or redesigning and modifying existing biological systems. This approach aims to engineer gene-based programs to modify cellular function to achieve a desired biological outcome, such as the survival of infused T cells, production of IL-12, or the safe elimination of cancerous cells. 
 Using our Sleeping Beauty platform, we are developing TCR+ T therapies, initially to target solid tumors. Our T cell receptor, or TCR, program designs and manufactures T cells that target antigens unique to each patient, thereby delivering truly personalized therapy that can attack an individual patients cancer. The Sleeping Beauty system uses DNA plasmids to reprogram T cells to express introduced TCRs on a patient-by-patient basis (addressing inter-tumor heterogeneity) and to express more than one TCR for each patient (addressing intra-tumor heterogeneity). We believe the scalability of our approach provides a competitive advantage to alternative viral-based approaches to T-cell manufacturing. Under our Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, the National Cancer Institute, or the NCI, intends to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with a variety of solid tumors using the Sleeping Beauty platform to genetically modify T-cells to target patient-specific neoantigens in mid-2019. The clinical trial will be under the direction of Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., Chief of the Surgery Branch at the NCI. 
 We are also developing CAR+ T therapies using our Sleeping Beauty platform. This CAR+ T program seeks to solve the complex and costly manufacturing limitations of existing CAR+ T therapies that we believe will continue limiting their commercial potential. We believe using DNA plasmids in the Sleeping Beauty system to express CAR and our proprietary membrane-bound interleukin 15, or mbIL15, in resting T cells obtained from peripheral blood will enable infused T cells to propagate within the patient to target leukemia and lymphoma, thus avoiding the need to numerically expand T cells for weeks in bioreactors before patient administration. We

  expect the lower cost of DNA plasmids compared with the virus used by other CAR+ T programs, together with the avoidance of lengthy ex vivo manufacturing, will reduce the cost and complexity of manufacturing CAR+ T cells. These technologies should enable T cells to be infused within two days of gene transfer in a process we refer to as rapid personalized manufacture, or RPM. We are advancing our CAR+ T therapies in the United States in collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, or MD Anderson, to target CD19 on malignant B cells. In 2019, we expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in the United States of our third-generation Sleeping Beauty modified CAR+ T cells, co-expressing CAR and mbIL15, manufactured and reinfused into the patient in less than two days from gene transfer. In addition, in a joint venture with TriArm Therapeutics, Ltd., or TriArm, we are forming Eden BioCell, Ltd., or Eden BioCell, to lead clinical development and commercialization of Sleeping Beauty-generated CD19-specific CAR-T therapies in the Peoples Republic of China, Taiwan and Korea. Eden BioCell will be owned equally by us and TriArm and the parties will share decision-making authority. TriArm has committed up to $35.0 million to this joint venture and will manage all clinical development to execute trials in the territory. We expect our joint venture with TriArm to close in the first half of 2019 and we may evaluate additional programs to pursue in this joint venture. 
 Our Controlled IL-12 platform uses virotherapy based on an engineered replication-incompetent adenovirus (Ad-RTS-hIL-12) plus veledimex as a gene delivery system to conditionally produce IL-12, a potent, naturally occurring anti-cancer protein, to treat patients with solid tumors where a specific target is unknown, including brain cancer. Our Controlled IL-12 platform allows us to deliver IL-12 in a tunable dose, which we believe is critical for this potent cytokine. In a Phase 1 clinical trial of patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, or rGBM, a subset of patients (n=6) who received low-dose steroids along with 20 mg of veledimex plus Ad-RTS-hIL-12, achieved 17.8 months median overall survival, or OS, compared with five to eight months OS established in historical controls. Thirty-six additional patients with rGBM have been recruited into a sub study designed to encourage use of low-dose steroids and 20 mg veledimex to further understand the potential of Controlled IL-12 as a monotherapy. We are also developing our Controlled IL-12 platform in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In June 2018, we began enrolling patients with rGBM to receive Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex in combination with OPDIVO® (nivolumab) in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial. In November 2018, we announced a clinical supply agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, to evaluate Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex in combination with Regenerons PD-1 antibody Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc) for the treatment of patients with rGBM. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in the first half of 2019 in approximately 30 patients with rGBM to measure preliminary safety and efficacy of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex in combination with Libtayo. 
 OUR STRATEGY 
 Our goal is to be a leading cell therapy company focused on discovering and developing TCR and CAR+ T therapies where the target of these T cells is known. We also seek to develop our Controlled IL-12 platform as both a monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We believe our ability to control IL-12 will allow us to use this platform to treat multiple types of cancers when the tumor target is unknown. 
 Key elements of our strategy include: 
 

 | Building an end-to-end TCR solution targeting solid tumors. We believe that the NCIs study, expected to initiate in mid-2019, will represent the first time a non-viral, genetically engineered TCR+ T-cell therapy will be administered to patients. We intend to strengthen our position in the field of T-cell targeting solid tumors by investing significantly to optimize and expand our process development and manufacturing capabilities, creating an end-to-end, scalable solution.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Advancing our third generation CAR+ T program. We believe our CAR+ T therapies may solve the manufacturing difficulties limiting the commercial potential of other CAR+ T programs. In 2019, we expect to initiate a U.S. Phase 1 clinical trial of our third generation Sleeping Beauty-modified CAR+ T cells, co-expressing mbIL15 with CAR+ T cells, manufactured and reinfused back into the patient in

less than two days from gene transfer. Our CAR+T program targeting CD19 on malignant B cells will be developed in collaboration with MD Anderson in the United States and with Eden BioCell in greater China, assuming the closing of this joint venture. Under our exclusive license agreement with Precigen, Inc., we also have rights to a second, unnamed CAR target.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Executing on the clinical trials of our Controlled IL-12 platform as both a monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In 2019, we will execute on several clinical trials to treat rGBM with our Controlled IL-12 program as both a monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1 inhibitors, with top-line data likely in 2020. We are preparing our Controlled IL-12 platform to enter Phase 3 clinical trials following the completion of our ongoing and planned Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Our Controlled IL-12 platform may enable the treatment of a broad range of solid tumors and we expect to explore additional indications to pursue with one or more partners.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Selectively collaborating with third parties that provide complementary technologies or capabilities. We expect to collaborate selectively with companies that have enabling technologies or other capabilities to accelerate the development of our programs. In any collaboration, we expect to retain development control or receive significant economic and commercial rights to our product candidates.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Creating a leading, fully integrated biotechnology company focused on advancing our oncology platforms through clinical trials. Following the execution of our exclusive license agreement with Precigen, Inc. on October 5, 2018, we maintain full development control of our programs. We now seek to supplement our existing team with additional research and development depth, particularly focused on cell therapy, in order to accelerate the execution of our clinical programs. In addition, we expect to continue expanding our management team and board of directors.

SLEEPING BEAUTY PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY 
 We are pursuing non-viral genetic engineering technologies to develop novel CAR+ T and TCR therapies. The platform we have licensed from MD Anderson uses the Sleeping Beauty non-viral genetic modification system to generate and characterize new CAR and TCR designs in T cells. 
 Limitations of Existing Approaches to Manufacturing T-Cell Therapies 
 T cells are a type of white blood cell that play a central role in the immune system. T cells are involved in both detecting and killing infected or abnormal cells, such as cancer cells, as well as coordinating immune responses. In recent years, companies have begun developing therapies that include T cells engineered specifically for each patient. Manufacturing such products is separated into discrete steps and typically undertaken at a centralized facility. The production time varies from approximately two to four weeks with additional time needed for quality control requirements. Manufacturing based on viral transduction, propagation and shipping has many drawbacks: 

 | Time to manufacture. The need to propagate (numerically expand) T cells requires the product be in culture in compliance with current manufacturing practice, or cGMP, during which the intended recipient may be unable to receive the genetically modified T cells.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expense of production. The need to generate virus and the production time with the associated logistical complications increase the cost of manufacturing the genetically modified T cells.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Required lymphodepletion. The infusion of T cells that have been propagated ex vivo, or outside the body, tends to make them dependent on cytokines to survive and thrive after infusion. This has resulted in the use of chemotherapy and other approaches of immunosuppression to free up pro-survival cytokines, such as endogenous IL-15, in the recipient prior to the administration of T cells. Lymphodepletion facilitates the sustained persistence of genetically-modified T cells in the patient, but it exposes the patient to medical complications, raises expense, and limits the ability of the technology to be scaled as the administration of chemotherapy requires specialized centers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
6 


 
 | Toxicity. Infusing large numbers of T cells recognizing a single antigen, such as CD19, commonly places the recipient at risk from the synchronous activation of these T cells resulting in cytokine release syndrome and other associated toxicities, which can be severe and life threatening.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe these disadvantages limit the commercial potential of CAR-T therapies and will restrict companies from commercializing effective TCR therapies. 
 Sleeping Beauty Solution 
 The Sleeping Beauty system is a gene transfer method that utilizes a transposase enzyme to cut and paste donor transposon DNA from introduced plasmid into chromosomes using a process called transposition. The system can be used to deliver genes to a variety of cell types including human T cells. Sleeping Beauty transposons appear to integrate in a random distribution at thymine-adenine, or TA, dinucleotide sites, making them less likely to cause off-target effects when compared to other transposons and viral gene delivery methods. 
 We use the Sleeping Beauty system to express TCRs that target patients antigens as well as CARs that enable a T cell to recognize specific proteins or antigens that are present on the surface of other cells. Our third generation CAR+ T therapy uses the Sleeping Beauty system to co-express our proprietary mbIL15 and a kill switch along with the CAR. Interleukin 15 (IL-15) has a variety of apparently beneficial effects as it is considered a pro-survival cytokine that promotes survival of T cells. Our pre-clinical data suggest that incorporating mbIL15 into a CAR+ T therapy enhances in vivo persistence of the CAR+ T cell. 
 We believe our Sleeping Beauty platform has several advantages compared with the viral gene transfer technologies used by other CAR-T and TCR companies: 
 

 | Reduced costs. By using DNA plasmid and avoiding the time-consuming and laborious manufacture of virus, our Sleeping Beauty technology may reduce the manufacturing expense and challenges associated with viral gene transfer systems in creating T-cells engineered to express CAR and TCR.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Shortened manufacturing. We expect the T-cell manufacturing process with Sleeping Beauty to significantly shorten virus-based manufacturing times. In the preclinical setting, the time to administration of third-generation Sleeping Beauty-modified T cells co-expressing mbIL15 and a kill switch has been shortened to two days or less from gene transfer. This reduction in time is primarily achieved through the elimination of the need for in vitro T-cell activation and propagation which avoids the need to culture T cells, which can take between approximately two and four weeks.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Potential to avoid lymphodepletion. The addition of our proprietary mbIL15 likely enables the administration of CAR-expressing younger T cells with an ability to be long-lived after infusion. The ability of CAR+ T cells to signal via mbIL15 increases CAR persistence and has the potential to eliminate lymphodepletion as the T cells rely on their own source of this pro-survival cytokine rather than scavenging endogenous soluble IL-15 from the recipient.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Customizable therapies. Our Sleeping Beauty platform may allow us to manufacture more customizable therapies, therefore enabling us to provide personalized TCR+ T-cell therapy against unique, and potentially multiple, patient-specific neoantigens.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Potential improved safety profile. Given the inclusion of mbIL15, we expect the T cells in our CAR+ T therapies to engraft from low starting (infusion) numbers. We believe this reduced T-cell dose may reduce the side effects caused by cytokine release syndrome, which is often experienced by patients receiving larger infusions of CAR+ T cells.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Local Manufacturing. Our Sleeping Beauty technology enables the potential for a hospital-based manufacturing model rather than the centralized manufacturing approach currently being employed for other CAR+ T-cell products.

 SLEEPING BEAUTY TCR PROGRAM 
 Background 
 Each T cell has a unique alpha/beta TCR and an ability to rapidly increase in numbers when the TCR interrogates a target and detects a threat. A TCR can recognize cancer cells as a threat as the receptor docks with a specialized set of molecules on the cancer cell surface called the major histocompatibility complex, or MHC. The MHC reveals the health of a cell based on the loading of peptides (processed protein), which then await examination by unique TCRs on populations of T cells. Two types of MHC, Class I and Class II, are interrogated by TCRs on T cells. Class I molecules activate CD8+ T cells which have evolved an ability to be efficient killers. Class II molecules activate CD4+ T cells which help coordinate an efficient immune response. In each person, there are both many different TCR structures and many different MHC structures. TCRs within each person are adapted to work with their own MHC structures or alleles. For a T cell to recognize and destroy a tumor cell, the TCR must recognize the foreign antigen in the context of MHC and then be activated to deepen the engagement to kill the cell. This is different than CARs, which directly recognize antigens, such as CD19 on the surface of malignant B cells, without the need for presentation by MHC. 
 Genes in cancer cells can lead to the production of proteins, which are then processed by the cell into protein fragments known as peptides. When these peptides are presented to T cells by MHC, by either tumor cells or antigen presenting cells, and they result in T-cell activation, they are known as antigens. When these presented peptides are derived from proteins which are in turn expressed from genes that are mutated only in tumor cells, they are known as neoantigens. Tumor cells presenting neoantigens via MHC are targets for T cells. T cells can recognize and kill neoantigen-presenting cancer cells and effect a positive feedback loop to heighten the immune response. 
 The immune system avoids targeting the bodys own healthy cells principally through processes known as immune tolerance by which T cells do not respond to MHCs containing peptides from normal proteins and therefore avoid targeting healthy cells for destruction. The recognition by the TCR of peptide presented by the MHC is a vital immune mechanism that allows the body both to respond against foreign threats, including cancer, as well as to avoid targeting the bodys own healthy cells. 
 Tumors utilize a variety of strategies to evade and suppress the host immune system. This renders T cells residing within the tumor, referred to as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TIL, ineffective and, despite expressing tumor-specific TCRs, unable to recycle their effector functions to eliminate tumor. To overcome immune suppression, fresh T cells are needed, such as those found in the peripheral blood. However, these circulating T cells do not typically express tumor-specific TCRs in sufficient numbers. We seek to address this problem by genetically modifying peripheral blood-derived T cells to express TCRs with specificity to tumor-derived antigens, especially neoantigens, and propagating them to sufficient numbers prior to administration.

 The figure below describes how T-cell recognition of genetic mutations leads to the killing of tumor cells. 
 


Targeting Neoantigens 
 Neoantigens are encoded by tumor-specific mutated genes that are often unique to each patient. During cancer initiation and progression, tumor cells acquire mutations in naturally-occurring genes that are either responsible for transformation, known as driver mutations, or are a byproduct of the genomic instability that accompanies cancer formation, known as passenger mutations. 
 Several companies are pursuing public antigens that are encoded within a patients normal germline, such as PRAME, MAGE series, and NY-ESO-1. Targeting these antigens when they occur in tumors typically enables a library of pre-assembled TCRs to be created as proteins from these germline targets can be shared within cancer types between patients. We believe there are several drawbacks to relying solely on this approach: 

 | Public antigens are not present in many tumors, which limits their appeal.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Public antigens are often not homogeneously expressed throughout the tumor because they are typically not driver mutations, which increases the likelihood that the infused TCR-modified T cells will not deliver a complete response.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Public antigens are, by definition, also coded within the germline, leading to endogenous TCRs used for cloning and re-expression having weak affinity and the native T cell unable to recognize the cancer due to immune tolerance. As a result, ex vivo genetic alteration of the alpha and beta chains of the TCR is likely required to improve affinity, which increases the likelihood of on-target, but off-tissue toxicity resulting in adverse events.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the superior approach is to genetically modify T cells to target each patients neoantigens. This requires a personal approach to T-cell therapy in which the introduced TCRs recognize the neoantigens of a patients tumor. These neoantigens can be driver mutations and, therefore, the cancer cell relies upon their presence rendering it less likely the tumor can escape and thus relapse from this form of targeted T-cell therapy. We believe that neoantigen-targeted therapies will improve patient outcomes, particularly for patients with solid tumors.

 There are three essential steps in creating a T-cell therapy targeting personalized neoantigens: 
 

1. | Detecting and prioritizing neoantigens. Detecting a patients unique set of neoantigens requires one or more samples of the patients malignant tissue(s) and sampling of normal cells, followed by sequencing to reveal a catalog of candidate neoantigens that are found in the tumor cells, but not in normal cells. Bioinformatics can be used to prioritize the candidate neoantigens that are driver mutations.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Detecting and prioritizing TCRs. Only a subset of candidate sequence changes are neoantigens as defined by their ability to stimulate a T-cell response. Validating targets requires the presentation of candidate neoantigens via MHC with T cells to be co-cultured with antigen presenting cells to efficiently identify the reactive T cells. One or more of the TCRs from individual reactive T cells are then sequenced.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Manufacturing TCR+ T cells. The sequence of one or more TCRs recognizing neoantigens are placed into DNA plasmids as Sleeping Beauty transposons. These DNA plasmids are inserted into T cells derived from peripheral blood using a process called electroporation. T cells stably expressing the introduced TCR(s) are then propagated to produce the TCR+ T cells in clinically-sufficient numbers before they are released for administration into a patient.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The process for the production and infusion of Sleeping Beauty TCR-modified T cells is based on the electro-transfer of DNA plasmids containing coding for TCR(s) recognizing one or more neoantigens into T cells derived from a patients peripheral blood. The TCR is sequenced from TIL responding to the targeted neoantigens. Following electroporation, the genetically modified T cells are propagated to large numbers based on the rapid expansion protocol which is a technology that has been shown to generate T cells that can recognize and eliminate solid tumors. We believe the use of circulating T cells, rather than TIL, will improve the T cells ability to kill tumor cells because these lymphocytes are generally young and can proliferate and survive in vivo to provide anti-tumor effects. 
 


To be successful, genetically modified T cells targeting one or more neoantigens will need to address the fact that (1) among a population of patients, not all tumors express the targeted neoantigen, referred to as inter-tumor heterogeneity, and (2) within a single patient, not all tumor cells express the targeted antigen, referred to as 
 
10 


  intra-tumor heterogeneity. Inter-tumor heterogeneity limits the number of recipients that are eligible to receive a treatment and intra-tumor heterogeneity creates the risk of antigen-escape variants, increasing the likelihood of cancer relapse. As a result, we believe companies developing T-cell therapies targeting neoantigens must address both inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. 
 Clinical Development of TCR 
 We believe that a non-viral platform represents the only commercially feasible way of manufacturing neoantigen therapies due to the obstacles presented by inter-tumor heterogeneity and intra-tumor heterogeneity. In 2017, we entered into a CRADA with the NCI for the development of adoptive cell transfer-based immunotherapies to treat solid tumors. 
 The process used by the NCI under the CRADA, and the process we expect to use the future, includes three-linked parts. The first is identifying one or more neoantigens that underlie the changes from a normal to a malignant cell. The second is the identification of one or more TCRs that recognize the neoantigens. The third is the ex vivo manufacturing of therapeutic T cells with specificity redirected to the desired neoantigens through the expression of the isolated TCRs. This last step, the production of T cells, is based on the use of the Sleeping Beauty system to stably express TCRs. Once the patient-derived T cells are genetically modified, they are propagated based on the NCIs established technology referred to as rapid expansion protocol which has produced clinical-grade T cells resulting in anti-tumor effects in other studies, including in patients with solid tumors. It is anticipated that patients will receive populations of T cells genetically modified to express more than one TCR so that more than one neoantigen can be targeted in the patient. We expect infusing multiple TCRs per patient will reduce the probability of leaving some cancer cells unaddressed, lowering the risk of cancer relapse. 
 Under our CRADA, the NCI will perform clinical evaluations of the ability of these Sleeping Beauty-engineered T cells to express TCRs that are reactive against neoantigens to mediate cancer regression in patients with refractory (e.g., metastatic) solid tumors for several tumor types, including gastrointestinal and genitourinary, breast, ovarian, non-small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma. This research is being conducted at the NCI under the direction of Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., Chief of the Surgery Branch at the NCI. We expect the NCI will begin treating patients in this clinical trial in mid-2019.
Solid Tumor Malignancy Market 
 Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States, accounting for nearly one of every four deaths. Approximately 1,735,350 new cancer cases were expected to be diagnosed, and 609,640 cancer deaths expected to occur, in the United States in 2018 according to the American Cancer Society. Of these, the majority were caused by solid tumors. Invasive cancer, such as malignancies of epithelial tissue represent 80% to 90% of all cancer cases according to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute. These diseases include colorectal, lung, ovarian, skin, bladder, head and neck cancers, among others. 
 SLEEPING BEAUTY CAR-T PROGRAM 
 Background 
 We are developing CAR+ T cell therapies targeting CD19 for hematologic malignancies using our Sleeping Beauty platform. Our CAR+ T program is focused on (1) shortening the time the patient must wait for treatment with engineered T cells, (2) increasing the access of hospitals to deliver, and patients to receive, this therapy, and (3) providing safe and efficacious personalized T-cell therapies to patients. 
 CARs are engineered molecules that, when present on the surface of a T cell, enable the T cell to directly recognize specific proteins or antigens that are present on the surface of other cells. Autologous CAR+ T-cell therapies are manufactured individually for the recipients use by modifying the patients own T cells outside the body, causing the T cells to stably express CARs. Our CAR+ T program is focused on CD19, which is a protein expressed on the cell surface of B cells and a validated target for B cell driven hematological malignancies. 
 
11 


 Two autologous anti-CD19 CAR+ T cell therapies have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Kymriah®) and R/R large B-cell lymphoma (Kymriah® and Yescarta®). These approaches have been successful in helping patients fight cancer, in particular CD19-positive cancers, resulting in significant remission rates. However, we anticipate that the viral manufacturing approaches used to manufacture these therapies will limit their commercial success. 
 We believe our Sleeping Beauty CAR+ T therapy will offer distinct advantages to the approach used by other CAR-T cell companies. In particular, the ability of the DNA plasmids from the Sleeping Beauty system to integrate into resting T cells, coupled with expression of mbIL15 and CAR, will enable infused T cells to propagate within the patient to target leukemias and lymphoma, thereby avoiding the need to numerically expand T cells for weeks in bioreactors before administration. The reduced cost associated with using DNA plasmids, instead of virus and avoiding lengthy ex vivo manufacturing, and the flexibility to insert industry leading CAR technology in a cassette based approach, provides a solution to the cost and complexity of the current approach to manufacturing CAR+ T cells. 
 Clinical Development of CAR+ T 
 First generation. We entered the clinic in 2015 with CAR+ T therapies utilizing the non-viral genetic modification capabilities of the Sleeping Beauty system. These trials used first-generation technologies, the results from which were published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in September 2016. 
 An update on patients in the first-generation trials was presented in a poster at the 2017 Annual Meeting of ASH. The trials demonstrated that first-generation Sleeping Beauty-modified CD19-specific CAR+ T cells appear to provide long-term cancer control when infused after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, or HSCT, for patients with advanced CD19+ malignancies. 
 All seven patients with advanced CD19+ non-Hodgkins lymphoma that received autologous T-cells were alive with a median survival of 40 months since T-cell infusion. We reported the proportion of patients who were alive was 100% and progression free was 86%. For 19 patients with advanced CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkins lymphoma infused with allogeneic T-cells following HSCT, nine patients were alive with a median survival of 31 months. The proportion of patients reported alive was 49% and the proportion of patients that were progression free was 32%. Of the subset of eight patients who received donor-derived T-cells after haploidentical HSCT, the proportion of patients who were alive was 63% and the proportion of patients that were progression free was 50%. These survival rates compare favorably with historical data for patients receiving HSCT without CAR+ T administration. Patients receiving autologous HSCT have been reported to have a 3-year progression free survival of 49%. Patients receiving just allogeneic HSCT have been reported to have a one-year OS of 20-34%, and haploidentical (haplo) allogeneic HSCT patients have a 3-year OS of 37% and disease-free survival of 31%. 
 Persistence of circulating Sleeping Beauty-modified CAR+ T cells was demonstrated at two years in an autologous and allogeneic patient and for four years in two autologous patients. 
 Second generation. We are currently enrolling patients in an investigator-led Phase 1 trial using second-generation CD19-specific CAR+ T cells with a revised CAR structure in patients with advanced lymphoid malignancies at MD Anderson. Our second-generation CD19 trial employs a revised CAR design and shortened manufacturing process advancement, with culturing times as short as two weeks. 
 A summary of this ongoing trial was presented by Dr. Partow Kebriaei of MD Anderson in a presentation at the 2017 Annual Meeting of ASH in December 2017. Interim data from the trial demonstrated that autologous T-cells infused after lymphodepleting chemotherapy could be detected and exhibited anti-tumor effects and had an encouraging safety profile in patients with relapsed/refractory CD19+ malignancies. Complete responses at 
 
12 


  one month were reported in four of eight patients with either ALL (n=5), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=1), or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=2), with two morphologic complete responses at three months. Follow-up blood tests demonstrated sustained persistence of infused T-cells and targeting of malignant and normal B cells. There were no dose limiting toxicities with only grade 1 or 2 adverse events being reported. T-cell dose escalation continues and we have recently completed Cohort 3. We anticipate stopping enrollment in this trial when our third-generation trial moves forward in the clinic, as further described below. 
 Third generation. In the preclinical setting, the time to manufacture and administer third-generation Sleeping Beauty-modified CAR+ T cells co-expressing mbIL15 has been reduced to two days or less from gene transfer. This very rapid manufacturing process likely delivers genetically modified T cells with superior therapeutic potential in vivo. Preclinical studies of third-generation Sleeping Beauty CAR+ T cells, presented at the 2017 Annual Meeting of ASH, demonstrated that a single dose of T cells co-expressing a CD19-specific CAR, mbIL15, and kill switch resulted in sustained in vivo persistence that produced potent anti-tumor effects and superior leukemia-free survival in mice. 
 In June 2018, we announced the FDA placed our investigator-led Investigational New Drug, or IND, application on clinical hold for the proposed Phase 1 trial to evaluate CD19-specific CAR-T therapies very rapidly manufactured at MD Anderson. The FDA has requested additional information relating to chemistry, manufacturing and controls, specifically requesting that the product meet a minimum threshold for cell viability. By applying improved principles of engineering and cell processing, we have made progress to achieve this threshold in manufacturing runs. Thus, we expect to respond to the FDA and begin treating patients in the second half of 2019. 
 Joint Venture with Eden BioCell Limited 
 In December 2018, we announced that, in conjunction with TriArm Therapeutics, Ltd., or TriArm, we would launch Eden BioCell, Ltd., or Eden BioCell, to lead clinical development and commercialization of Sleeping Beauty-generated CAR-T therapies in the Peoples Republic of China (including Macau and Hong Kong), Taiwan and Korea. TriArm is a privately-owned cell therapy company with operations in Germany, China and the United States that was formed by Panacea Venture Healthcare, a fund co-founded and managed by James Huang, Managing Partner of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers China. 
 We expect to license the rights to Eden BioCell for third-generation Sleeping Beauty-generated CAR-T therapies targeting the CD19 antigen. Eden BioCell will be owned equally by us and TriArm and the parties will share decision-making authority. TriArm has committed up to $35.0 million to this joint venture and will manage all clinical development to execute trials in the territory. We expect our joint venture with TriArm to close in the first half of 2019. 
Hematologic Tumor Malignancy Market 
 According to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, an estimated 174,250 people are expected to be diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma in 2018. New diagnoses for such hematologic malignancies in the United States represented approximately 10% of the new cancer cases in the United States in 2018. 
CONTROLLED IL-12 PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY 
 Background 
 Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex is our gene delivery system to regulate production of IL-12, a potent, naturally occurring anti-cancer protein which functions as a master regulator of the immune system. We control the generation of recombinant IL-12 using a replication-incompetent adenoviral, or Ad, vector administered via a 
 
13 


  single injection of virus into the brain tumor and engineered to conditionally express human IL-12, or hIL-12. The conditional expression of hIL-12 is modulated with the RheoSwitch Therapeutic System® (RTS®) by the small molecule veledimex, an activator ligand orally administered that has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier. 
 In this way, Ad-RTS-hIL-12 is administered within the tumor under the control of the RTS switch. Activation of the switch, and therefore conditional gene expression and subsequent IL-12 protein production, is tightly controlled by the activator ligand, veledimex, delivered to the patient as a daily oral capsule, typically over 14 days. When veledimex is administered to a patient, the switch is turned on and IL-12 is produced; when veledimex is withdrawn, the switch is turned off and production of recombinant IL-12 ceases. The amount of IL-12 produced is proportional to the dosing of veledimex which further enhances control of this cytokine. 
 


The recombinant IL-12 appears to be biologically active as, for example, it can stimulate production of the bodys own interferon-gamma, or IFN-g. IL-12 is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine capable of reversing immune escape mechanisms and improving the function of tumor fighting natural killer, or NK, cells and T cells. 
 Controlled IL-12 has been shown to biologically turn cold tumors hot. In our clinical trials, we have seen deep and sustained infiltration of activated T cells (i.e., hot tumors) where previously there had been very little T cell infiltration (i.e., cold tumors). Data from repeat biopsies obtained four to six months following administration of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex has shown an increased and sustained infiltration of activated T-cells producing IFN-g within the brain-tumor lesion. Data from our Phase 1 monotherapy clinical trial provided compelling evidence from biopsies, taken more than four months after administration of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex, demonstrating that Controlled IL-12 causes a sustained influx of activated killer (CD8+) T cells into brain tumors. These data also show upregulated expression of PD-1/PDL-1 biomarkers, suggesting that the combination of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, such as targeting PD-1, may improve patient outcomes. 
 These data are consistent with our biopsy data from patients with breast cancer and melanoma that received Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex.

 Clinical Development of Controlled IL-12
We have tested Ad-RTS-IL-12 plus veledimex in several Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma, breast cancer and brain cancer. We have focused much of our efforts in developing Ad-RTS-IL-12 plus veledimex, as both a monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, for adults and children with recurrent brain tumors. We believe Controlled IL-12 may have broad applicability and we may explore initiating clinical trials in additional oncology indications as a monotherapy or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, either alone or with partners. 
 Monotherapy: Clinical Development Ad-RTS-IL-12 plus Veledimex for Adult rGBM. Our multi-center Phase 1 trial in patients with rGBM, which was initiated in June 2015, continues to show promising data with preliminary evidence of a survival benefit and a predictable and manageable safety profile. The primary objective of the Phase 1 trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of a single intra-tumoral Ad-RTS-hIL-12 injection activated upon dosing with oral veledimex. Secondary objectives are to determine the maximum tolerated dose, the immune responses elicited, and assessment of biologic response. The trial enrolled patients at doses ranging from 10 mg to 40 mg of veledimex. 
 A subset of six subjects in this clinical trial who received low-dose steroids (less than 20 mg of dexamethasone) along with 20 mg of veledimex achieved 17.8 months median OS compared with five to eight months OS established in historical controls. In our Phase 1 trial in rGBM, Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex continues to be safe and well tolerated, with adverse events, or AEs, that were predictable and reversible, neurologic AEs that were relatively mild and transient, and with no drug-related deaths. 
 In 2018, we initiated an expansion sub study to enroll additional subjects taking 20 mg of veledimex, which is now fully enrolled with an additional 36 subjects. Based on the promising results seen in the six patients that received low-dose steroids in the original Phase 1 clinical trial, a goal of the sub study was to increase the patient population enrolled with 20 mg of veledimex as well low doses of steroids. At least 15 of the subjects in our expansion study received low-dose steroids (dexamethasone), bringing the total to at least 21 subjects in this subset.

 Combination Therapy. We have initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Companys OPDIVO® (nivolumab), an immune checkpoint inhibitor, or PD-1 inhibitor, in adult patients with rGBM. This trial was initiated in 2018 and will explore the potentially synergistic effect of this combination in up to 18 patients. We expect to complete enrollment in the second quarter of 2019. 
 In November 2018, we announced a clinical supply agreement with Regeneron to evaluate Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex in combination with Regenerons PD-1 antibody Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc) to treat patients with rGBM. Libtayo has been approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in the first half of 2019 in approximately 30 patients with rGBM to measure preliminary safety and efficacy of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex in combination with Libtayo. Under the terms of our agreement, we will be responsible for the conduct and costs of the clinical trial, and Regeneron will supply Libtayo for the trial. We may potentially explore the Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex in combination with Libtayo in additional indications. 
 Monotherapy: Pediatrics. In 2017, we dosed the first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors. This open label trial will assess the safety and tolerability of a single intra-tumoral injection of Ad-RTS-hIL-12, and is conducted in two groups. The first is comprised of pediatric patients with recurrent or progressive supratentorial brain tumors, while the second comprises pediatric patients with glioma in the pontine region of the brain, known as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or DIPG. This Phase 1 trial is being conducted at leading pediatric cancer centers across the United States, including Ann & Robert H. Lurie Childrens Hospital in Chicago, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and the University of California, San Francisco. 
 Glioblastoma Market. We are currently developing Controlled IL-12 to treat patients with rGBM. Glioblastoma is an aggressive primary brain tumor affecting approximately 74,000 people worldwide each year; it is a fast-growing, aggressive type of central nervous system tumor, with an estimated 12,760 new adult cases predicted in the United States for 2018 according to the American Brain Tumor Association. Recurrence rates for this type of cancer are near 90 percent, and prognosis for adult patients is poor with treatment often combining multiple approaches including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. 
 Recurrent glioblastoma is an aggressive cancer with one of the lowest 3-year survival rates, at 3%, among all cancers. For patients who have experienced multiple recurrences, the prognosis is particularly poor, with a OS of six to seven months, while overall survival in patients who have failed temozolomide and bevacizumab, or equivalent salvage chemotherapy, is approximately three to five months. Given the poor overall prognosis and lack of effective treatments, new therapeutic approaches for malignant gliomas are needed. 
 In children, the incidence of brain cancer is approximately 4.84 per 100,000, according to the NCI. DIPG accounts for approximately 15 percent of all cases of pediatric brain tumors, with a median survival time of less than one year. Because of where these tumors are situated, DIPG is inaccessible to surgery and there are no known curative options.

 Precigen will pay us royalties ranging from low-single digits to mid-single digits on the net sales derived from the sale of Precigens CAR products, up to $50.0 million. 
 In consideration of our entry into the License Agreement, Intrexon has forfeited and returned to us all shares of our Series 1 preferred stock held by or payable to Intrexon as of the date of the License Agreement. 
 We determined that this transaction represented a capital transaction between related parties. We fair valued the preferred stock and the derivative liability on the date of the transaction, noting a total fair value of $163.3 million. The relinquishment of our obligation under the Ares Trading Agreement was also considered part of the overall capital transaction. We recognized an additional credit to accumulated deficit of $49.5 million as a result of the relief of the obligation under the Ares Trading Agreement (Note 8). The total amount of the settlement was $212.8 million. 
 We incurred approximately $7.4 million of transaction advisory costs with third-party vendors, of which $5.4 million was considered a direct cost associated with the Series 1 preferred stock extinguishment and is also included as part of the consideration transferred. The remaining $2.0 million of transaction costs were recognized as an expense during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
 We recognized a net credit to accumulated deficit of $207.3 million, calculated as the difference in the carrying value of the Series 1 preferred stock, derivative liability, and contract liability, and the consideration transferred of $5.4 million, in connection with the transaction. This amount is included in net income available to common shareholders in the calculation of earnings per share (Note 3). 
 License AgreementThe University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center 
 On January 13, 2015, we, together with Intrexon, entered into the MD Anderson License with MD Anderson (which Intrexon subsequently assigned to Precigen). Pursuant to the MD Anderson License, we, together with Precigen, hold an exclusive, worldwide license to certain technologies owned and licensed by MD Anderson including technologies relating to novel CAR T-cell therapies, non-viral gene transfer systems, genetic modification and/or propagation of immune cells and other cellular therapy approaches, Natural Killer, or NK Cells, and TCRs, arising from the laboratory of Laurence Cooper, M.D., Ph.D., who became our Chief Executive Officer in May 2015 and was formerly a tenured professor of pediatrics at MD Anderson and is now currently a visiting scientist under that institutions policies. 
 On August 17, 2015, we, Precigen and MD Anderson entered into the Research and Development Agreement, to formalize the scope and process for the transfer by MD Anderson, pursuant to the terms of the MD Anderson License, of certain existing research programs and related technology rights, as well as the terms and conditions for future collaborative research and development of new and ongoing research programs. 
 Pursuant to the Research and Development Agreement, we, Precigen and MD Anderson formed a joint steering committee to oversee and manage and ongoing research programs. Under our License Agreement with Precigen, we and Precigen agreed that Precigen would no longer participate on the joint steering committee after the date of the License Agreement. As provided under the MD Anderson License, we provided funding for research and development activities in support of the research programs under the Research and Development Agreement for a period of three years and in an amount of no less than $15.0 million and no greater than $20.0 million per year. On November 14, 2017, we entered into an amendment to the Research and Development Agreement extending its term until April 15, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we made payments in the aggregate amount of $2.7 million to MD Anderson compared to $13.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash paid to MD Anderson during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in the prior year is a result of the final quarterly payment being made to MD Anderson in January 2018 and the result of approved expenditures incurred by us being deducted from the January 2018 quarterly payment. The net balance of cash resources on hand at MD Anderson available to offset expenses and future costs is 
 
18 


  $27.8 million, of which $18.4 million is included in other current assets and the remaining $9.4 million is included in non-current assets at December 31, 2018. 
 The term of the MD Anderson License expires on the last to occur of (a) the expiration of all patents licensed thereunder, or (b) the twentieth anniversary of the date of the MD Anderson License; provided, however, that following the expiration of the term of the MD Anderson License, we, together with Precigen, shall then have a fully-paid up, royalty free, perpetual, irrevocable and sublicensable license to use the licensed intellectual property thereunder. After ten years from the date of the MD Anderson License and subject to a 90-day cure period, MD Anderson will have the right to convert the MD Anderson License into a non-exclusive license if we and Precigen are not using commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed intellectual property on a case-by-case basis. After five years from the date of the MD Anderson License and subject to a 180-day cure period, MD Anderson will have the right to terminate the MD Anderson License with respect to specific technology(ies) funded by the government or subject to a third-party contract if we and Precigen are not meeting the diligence requirements in such funding agreement or contract, as applicable. MD Anderson may also terminate the agreement with written notice upon material breach by us and Precigen, if such breach has not been cured within 60 days of receiving such notice. In addition, the MD Anderson License will terminate upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events for both us and Precigen and may be terminated by the mutual written agreement of us, Precigen, and MD Anderson. 
 Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Cancer Institute 
 On January 10, 2017, we announced the signing of the CRADA with the NCI for the development of adoptive cell transfer, or ACT,-based immunotherapies genetically modified using the Sleeping Beauty transposon/transposase system to express TCRs for the treatment of solid tumors. The principal goal of the CRADA is to develop and evaluate ACT for patients with advanced cancers using autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes, or PBL, genetically modified using the non-viral Sleeping Beauty system to express TCRs that recognize neoantigens expressed within a patients cancer. Research conducted under the CRADA will be at the direction of Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., Chief of the Surgery Branch at the NCI, in collaboration with our researchers and Precigen researchers. Our remaining obligation, as of December 31, 2018, for the CRADA is $2.5 million over the next year, payable in $625 thousand payments on a quarterly basis. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we made payments of $2.5 million, each year. In February 2019, we extended our CRADA with the NCI for two years, committing an additional $5.0 million to this program. 
Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights and Protection
 Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection offering by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends of the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. 
 Pursuant to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, some of our patents, under certain conditions, may be eligible for limited patent term extension for a period of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during drug development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, this extension period cannot be extended beyond 14 years from the drugs approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the period of time elapsed between the effective date of an IND application or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the period of time between the submission date of the NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and FDA approval. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for any patent term extension or restoration. We intend to seek the benefits of this statute, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such benefits. 
 We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as those of our advisors, consultants, and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect proprietary 
 
19 


  know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely, and in the future, will continue to rely, on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we generally require employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. 
 Our patent position and proprietary rights are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Please read the Risk Related to Our Intellectual Property section for further information about certain risks and uncertainties that may affect our patent position and proprietary rights. 
 Additional information as of December 31, 2018 about material patents and other proprietary rights covering our product candidates is set forth below. 
 Ad-RTS-IL-12 plus veledimex and DC-RTS-IL-12 plus veledimex 
 The patent estate licensed to us by Precigen covering Ad-RTS-IL-12 plus activator ligands, such as veledimex and DC-RTS-IL-12 plus activator ligand compositions, methods of use, methods of manufacture, and formulations includes over one hundred patents and applications. This portfolio also includes issued and pending foreign patents in Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and other countries. The term of one or more of the issued patents may be extended due to the regulatory approval process.
 CAR+ T 
 In January 2015, we in-licensed from MD Anderson a technology portfolio that includes intellectual property directed to certain non-viral Sleeping Beauty system and CAR+ T cell and bioprocessing technology. Under the terms of the agreement, we have an exclusive license to certain of the intellectual property, a co-exclusive license to certain of the intellectual property technology and a non-exclusive license to certain of the intellectual property technology. Our rights to the MD Anderson intellectual property flow to us via our agreement with Precigen. 
 Governmental Regulation and Product Approval 
 As a biopharmaceutical company, we are subject to extensive regulation. Our programmed T-cell product candidates are regulated as biologics. With this classification, commercial production of our products will need to occur in registered and licensed facilities in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, for biologics. 
 Human immunotherapy products are a new category of therapeutics. The FDA categorizes human cell- or tissue-based products as either minimally manipulated or more than minimally manipulated and has determined that more than minimally manipulated products require clinical trials to demonstrate product safety and efficacy and the submission of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing authorization. 
 Government authorities in the United States (at the federal, state and local level) and in other countries and jurisdictions, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, sale, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

 U.S. Product Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biological products under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters and similar public notice of alleged non-compliance with laws, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be approved for marketing in the United States generally involves the following: 

 | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDAs regulations commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | preparation and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls used in product manufacture are adequate to preserve the biological products identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDAs current Good Tissue Practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | FDA acceptance, review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA, which might include review by an advisory committee, a panel typically consisting of independent clinicians and other experts who provide recommendations as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biological product candidate, including our product candidates, in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous the preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The clinical trial sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA before clinical testing can begin in the United States. An IND must contain the results of the preclinical tests, manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, a proposed clinical protocol, an investigators brochure, a sample informed consent form, and other materials. Clinical trial protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain

  adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing, such as toxicity studies, may continue even after the IND is submitted. 
 The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials or places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. 
 Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsors control. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDAs regulations comprising the GCP requirements. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the target disease or condition.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk to benefit profile of the product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. 
 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in 
 
22 


  laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human patients, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsors initial receipt of the information. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board, an independent group of experts that evaluates study data for safety and makes recommendations concerning continuation, modification, or termination of clinical trials, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated immunotherapy trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional nonclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for approved biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the products identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk 
 
23 


  Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the biological product, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For immunotherapy products, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the GTPs, to the extent applicable. These are FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA GTP regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a Complete Response Letter, which generally outlines the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Even with the submission of additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 The FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological products safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. 
 In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. We rely, and expect to continue to 
 
24 


  rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. 
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, with manufacturing processes, or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, complete withdrawal from the market, product recalls, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, product seizure or detention, injunctions, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a products approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDAs policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 
 Moreover, the FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 U.S. Marketing Exclusivity 
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as biosimilars. Biosimilars are approved pursuant to an abbreviated pathway whereby applicants need not submit the full slate of preclinical and clinical data, and approval is based in part on the FDAs findings of safety, purity, and potency for the original biologic (i.e., the reference product). Reference products are eligible to receive 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, which prevents the FDA from approving any biosimilars to the reference product through the abbreviated pathway, but does not prevent approval of BLAs that are accompanied by a full data package and that do not rely on the reference product. A biosimilar may be approved if the product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and there are no clinically meaningful differences with the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a trial. 
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for 
 
25 


  which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in significant part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity of and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. 
 Reimbursement may impact the demand for, and/or the price of, any product candidate which obtains marketing approval. Even if coverage and reimbursement is obtained for a given product candidate by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with those medications. Patients are unlikely to use a product, and physicians may be less likely to prescribe a product, unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of the product. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement is critical to new drug product acceptance. 
 The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and biologics, has become very intense. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide favorable coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Health Care Laws Governing Interactions with Healthcare Providers 
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products. Arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians, third-party payors and customers can expose pharmaceutical manufactures to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations laws that may affect a pharmaceutical manufactures ability to operate include, but are not limited to: 

 | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which regulates our business activities, including our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act which permits a private individual acting as a whistleblower to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
26 


 
 | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on entities and individuals subject to the law including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as individuals and entities that perform services for them which involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, known as business associates;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Requirements to report annually to CMS certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the ACA and its implementing regulations, including reporting any transfer of value made or distributed to teaching hospitals, prescribers, and other healthcare providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | State and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be made to healthcare providers and entities; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfer of value to physicians and other healthcare providers and entities; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Efforts to ensure that business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that a pharmaceutical manufacturers business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against a pharmaceutical manufacturer, and it is not successful in defending itself or asserting its rights, it may be subject to the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. In addition, the approval and commercialization of drug products outside the United States may also subject a pharmaceutical manufacturer to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws. 
 Healthcare Reform Efforts 
 A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Over the last several years, there have been federal and state proposals and legislation enacted regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, and making changes to healthcare financing and the delivery of care in the United States. 
 
27 


 In March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed healthcare financing by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the ACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are, among others, the following: 
 

 | created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drug agents or biologic agents, which is apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | increased the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | extended manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, unless the drug is subject to discounts under the 340B drug discount program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | created a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | created a new requirement to annually report drug samples that certain manufacturers and authorized distributors provide to physicians;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expanded healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | created new requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act for drug manufacturers to annually report information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | created a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | established a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | created a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain 
 
28 


  individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called Cadillac tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the donut hole. In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace ACA will impact ACA. 
 In addition, other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, as a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011, providers are subject to Medicare payment reductions of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments from providers from three to five years. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 also introduced a quality payment program under which certain individual Medicare providers will be subject to certain incentives or penalties based on new program quality standards. Payment adjustments for the Medicare quality payment program will begin in 2019. 
 Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administrations budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. On January 31, 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, proposed modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. While some of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly enacted legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation 
 
29 


  from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. 
 Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
 U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act and Other Laws 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts. 
 Our operations are also subject to non-U.S. anti-corruption laws such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or the Bribery Act.

 Competition 
 The development and commercialization for new products to treat cancer, including the indications we are pursuing, is highly competitive and considerable competition exists from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty cancer companies. Many of these companies have more experience in preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory, and global commercialization. We are also competing with academic institutions, governmental agencies, and private organizations that are conducting research in the field of cancer. 
 The biopharmaceutical industry, and the rapidly evolving market for developing genetically engineered T-cells, is characterized by significant competition and rapid innovation. Our genetically engineering T-cell programs face significant competition in the CAR and TCR technology space from multiple companies and their

  collaborators. Two such companies, Novartis International AG (Kymriah®) and Kite Pharma Inc./Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Yescarta®), have now commercialized autologous CAR+ T cells against CD19. Additional companies developing autologous CAR+ T targets include Juno Therapeutics Inc./Celgene Corporation, bluebird bio, Inc., in collaboration with Celgene Corporation, Nanjing Legend Biotech and Janssen Biotech, Inc., a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Autolus Therapeutics plc, Mustang Bio, Inc. and Marker Therapeutics, Inc. Several companies are pursuing the development of allogeneic CAR+ T therapies, including Allogene Therapeutics, Inc. (in collaboration with Pfizer Inc.), Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc. and Cellectis SA (in collaboration with Servier) which may compete with our product candidates. 
 Our TCR program faces competition from companies targeting shared antigens, including from Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline plc, Kite Pharma Inc./Gilead Sciences, Inc., Tmunity Therapeutics Inc, Medigene AG, Tactiva Therapeutics, LLC, Takara Bio Inc., TC BioPharm Ltd., TCR2 Therapeutics Inc. and Zelluna Immunotherapy AS. Several companies, including Advaxis Inc./Amgen Inc., BioNTech AG, Neon Therapeutics Inc. and Gritstone Oncology, Inc., are pursuing vaccine platforms to target neoantigens for solid tumors. Other companies are developing non-viral gene therapies, including Poseida Therapeutics, Inc. and several companies developing CRISPR technology. We also face competition from non-cell-based treatments offered by other companies such as Amgen Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Incyte Corporation, Merck & Co., Inc., and Roche Holding AG. 
 We are initially developing our Controlled IL-12 platform for the treatment of rGBM. Companies that sell marketed drugs for rGBM are Genentech, Inc. and Roche Holding AG with Avastin (bevacizumab), a vascular endothelial growth factor directed antibody indicated for the treatment of adults with rGBM. Arbor Pharmaceuticals Inc. markets GLIADEL Wafer, which is indicated in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade malignant glioma as an adjunct to surgery and radiation and is also indicated in patients with rGBM multiforme as an adjunct to surgery. 
 Several companies have product candidates in Phase 3 development for the treatment of glioblastoma. Tocagen Inc. is conducting a Phase 2/3 randomized, open-label study of Toca 511, a retroviral replicating vector, combined with Toca FC in subjects undergoing planned resection for rGBM. Vascular Biogenics Ltd. is developing VB-111, an anti-angiogenic non-replicating adenovirus, combined with bevacizumab, in patients with rGBM. DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing VAL-083, a systemic alkylating agent, in patients with rGBM who have failed standard temozolomide/radiation therapy and bevacizumab. 
 Other competitors with product candidates currently in Phase 2 clinical trials include AbbVie Inc.s Depatus-M (ABT-414) and DNA-2401, a conditionally replicative adenovirus being evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) for rGBM by DNATrix Inc. and Merck & Co., Inc. Duke University is enrolling a randomized Phase 2 study of oncolytic polio/rhinovirus recombinant (PVSRIPO) alone or in combination with lomustine in recurrent WHO Grade IV malignant glioma patients. Also, MedImmune, LLC/AstraZeneca plcs durvalumab was evaluated in a Phase 2 trial in patients with rGBM.

Corporate Information 
 We originally incorporated in Colorado in September 1998 (under the name Net Escapes, Inc.) and later changed our name to EasyWeb, Inc. in February 1999. We re-incorporated in Delaware on May 16, 2005 under the same name. On September 13, 2005, we completed a reverse acquisition of privately held Ziopharm, Inc., a Delaware corporation. To affect this transaction, we caused ZIO Acquisition Corp., our wholly-owned subsidiary, to merge with and into Ziopharm, Inc., with Ziopharm, Inc. surviving as our wholly owned subsidiary. In accordance with the terms of the merger, the outstanding common stock of Ziopharm, Inc. automatically converted into the right to receive an aggregate of approximately 97.3% of our outstanding common stock (after giving effect to the transaction). Following the merger, we caused Ziopharm, Inc. to merge
