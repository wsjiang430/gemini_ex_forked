Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 The terms “we,” “our,” “ours,” “us,” “Great Lakes” and “Company” refer to Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation and its subsidiaries.
 Organization
 Great Lakes is the largest provider of dredging services in the United States and is the only U.S. dredging service provider with significant international operations. The Company was founded in 1890 as Lydon & Drews Partnership and performed its first project in Chicago, Illinois. The Company changed its name to Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company in 1905 and was involved in a number of marine construction and landfill projects along the Chicago lakefront and in the surrounding Great Lakes region. Great Lakes now provides dredging services in the East, West, and Gulf Coasts of the United States and worldwide. 
 The Company operates in one operating segment, which is also the Company’s sole reportable segment and reporting unit. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2018, the management team proposed, and the board of directors approved, a plan to sell the Company’s historical environmental & infrastructure business. The Company has retained a financial advisor to assist with the process and expects to finalize disposition of the environmental & infrastructure business in the first half of 2019. The historical environmental & infrastructure segment has been retrospectively presented as discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale and is no longer reflected in continuing operations. Refer to Note 14, Business Dispositions, to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Operations 
 Dredging generally involves the enhancement or preservation of navigability of waterways or the protection of shorelines through the removal or replenishment of soil, sand or rock. Domestically, our work generally is performed in coastal waterways and deep water ports. The U.S. dredging market consists of four primary types of work: capital, coastal protection, maintenance and rivers & lakes. The Company’s “bid market” is defined as the aggregate dollar value of domestic dredging projects on which the Company bid or could have bid if not for capacity constraints or other considerations. The Company experienced an average combined bid market share in the U.S. of 46% over the prior three years, including 77%, 40%, 28% and 14% of the domestic capital, coastal protection, maintenance and rivers & lakes sectors, respectively.
 Over its 128 year history, the Company has grown to be a leader in capital, coastal protection and maintenance dredging in the U.S. and is one of the oldest and most experienced dredging companies in the United States. In addition, the Company is the only U.S. dredging service provider with significant international operations. Over the prior three years, foreign dredging operations accounted for an average of 13% of the Company’s dredging revenues. The Company’s foreign projects are typically categorized in the capital work type, but are not included in the aforementioned bid market.
 Capital (domestic is 54% of 2018 revenues). Capital dredging consists primarily of port expansion projects, which involve the deepening of channels and berthing basins to allow access by larger, deeper draft ships and the provision of land fill used to expand port facilities. In addition to port work, capital projects also include coastal restoration and land reclamations, trench digging for pipelines, tunnels and cables, and other dredging related to the construction of breakwaters, jetties, canals and other marine structures. Although capital work can be impacted by budgetary constraints and economic conditions, these projects typically generate an immediate economic benefit to the ports and surrounding communities.
 Foreign (2% of 2018 revenues). Foreign capital projects typically involve land reclamations, channel deepening and port infrastructure development. The Company targets foreign opportunities that are well suited to the Company’s equipment and where it faces reduced competition from its European competitors. Maintaining a presence in foreign markets has enabled the Company to diversify its customer base and take advantage of differences in global economic development. Over the last ten years, the Company has performed dredging work in the Middle East, Africa, Australia, the Caribbean and Central and South America.
 Coastal protection (28% of 2018 revenues). Coastal protection projects generally involve moving sand from the ocean floor to shoreline locations where erosion threatens shoreline assets. Beach erosion is a continuous problem that has intensified with the rise in coastal development and has become an important issue for state and local governments concerned with protecting beachfront tourism and real estate. Coastal protection via beach nourishment is often viewed as a better response to erosion than trapping sand through the use of sea walls and jetties, or relocating buildings and other assets away from the shoreline. Generally, coastal protection projects take place during the fall and winter months to minimize interference with bird and marine life migration and breeding patterns as well as coastal recreation activities.
 2

Maintenance (9% of 2018 revenues). Maintenance dredging consists of the re-dredging of previously deepened waterways and harbors to remove silt, sand and other accumulated sediments. Due to natural sedimentation, many channels require maintenance dredging every one to three years, thus creating a recurring source of dredging work that is typically non-deferrable if adequate commercial navigability is to be maintained. In addition, severe weather such as hurricanes, flooding and droughts can also cause the accumulation of sediments and drive the need for maintenance dredging.
 Rivers & lakes (7% of 2018 revenues). Domestic rivers and lakes dredging and related operations typically consist of lake and river dredging, inland levee and construction dredging, environmental restoration and habitat improvement and other marine construction projects. Although the Mississippi River has a large source of projects on which the Company bids, certain dredges used on these projects are more portable and able to be transported to take advantage of the fragmented market. Generally, inland river and lake projects in the northern U.S. take place in non-winter months because frozen waterways significantly reduce contractors’ ability to operate and transport its equipment in the relevant geographies.
 Demand Drivers
 The Company believes that the following factors are important drivers of the demand for its services:
 
 
• | Deep port capital projects. Most of the East Coast and Gulf ports have expansion plans that include deepening and widening in order to better compete for international trade. International trade, particularly in the intermodal container shipping business, is undergoing significant change as a result of the Panama Canal expansion, which was completed in 2016. Many shipping lines have announced plans to deploy larger ships which, due to the channel dimension requirements, currently would not be able to use many U.S. ports. Miami’s port deepening project was completed in 2015 and its port channels are now able to accommodate larger vessels. The first phase of a multi-year deepening effort of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project was completed in 2018. Dredging commenced on two Charleston Entrance Channel projects during 2018 and is expected to continue through 2020. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are resuming expansion efforts to remain competitive with deepened East Coast ports. Deepening projects in Boston, Jacksonville, Tampa and Corpus Christi were recently awarded. Further, projects to deepen the Mississippi River and Port of Norfolk, Virginia are being expedited. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the President signed America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018/Water Resources Development Act (“WRDA 2018”) into law. The Company views the bill as a positive catalyst for the domestic dredging industry as it authorizes funding for critical infrastructure improvements that are needed throughout the U.S. Further, the bill authorizes studies for future water resources improvements and makes modifications to previous authorizations. The Company is encouraged by the current administration's focus on repairing and rebuilding America's infrastructure, including our nation's ports and waterways. The Company believes that port deepening and expansion work authorized under current and anticipated future legislation will continue to provide significant opportunities for the domestic dredging industry.

• | Gulf coast restoration. There has been continued focus on restoring the barrier islands and wetlands that provide natural protection from storms in the Gulf Coast area. Many restoration projects have commenced to repair coastal areas. Several additional projects are being planned by state and local governments to restore natural barriers. The State of Louisiana has completed a master plan calling for a $50 billion investment in its coastal infrastructure, with a significant portion involving dredging. Additionally, during October 2015, BP plc settled the final Deepwater Horizon oil spill claims for approximately $20 billion. This amount reflects the preliminary agreement which was reached in the second quarter of 2015 and includes $5.5 billion related to Clean Water Act penalties. Several state and local governments have already reached agreements that resolve their claims in the disaster. Many of the Gulf States previously committed to spending a portion of the fines received to repair the natural resources impacted by the oil spill including on coastal restoration projects that include dredging. Although the bulk of the fines are to be paid over the next decade, the Company expects several coastal restoration projects envisioned by the Gulf States to come to fruition in the next couple of years providing a new source of domestic capital dredging projects on which the Company will bid. The annual bid market for domestic capital dredging, which includes deep port capital dredging and Gulf Coast restoration, averaged $382 million over the prior three years. During 2018, the Company continued work on the $88 million Mississippi coastal restoration project in the Gulf of Mexico which is expected to be completed in early 2019. Additional phases of the project are expected to bid in 2019.

• | Substantial need for coastal protection. Beach erosion is a recurring problem due to the normal ebb and flow of coastlines as well as the effects of severe storm activity. Growing populations in coastal communities and vital beach tourism are drawing attention to the importance of protecting beachfront assets. Over the past few years, both the federal government and state and local entities have funded beach work recognizing the essential role these natural barriers play in absorbing storm energy and protecting public and private property. With continued funding available for projects in the Northeast from the Superstorm Sandy supplemental appropriations, the Company expects to continue to see an increase in projects let for bid in the coastal protection market. As a result of the extreme storm systems last year involving Hurricanes Harvey,

Irma, and Maria, the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations passed supplemental appropriations for disaster relief and recovery which includes $17.4 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) to fund projects that will reduce the risk of future damage from flood and storm events. The Corps is beginning to provide visibility on its plans for this money, and it is currently believed that over $1 billion is expected to be added to its dredging related budget over the next few years. Most of this work is anticipated to be coastal protection related, but some funding may be provided for channel maintenance. During the fourth quarter of 2018, Congress passed an additional $1.7 billion of supplemental appropriations for disaster relief funding as a result of Hurricane Florence. The annual bid market for coastal protection over the prior three years averaged $315 million.

• | Required maintenance of U.S. ports. The channels and waterways leading to U.S. ports have stated depths on which shippers rely when entering those ports. Due to naturally occurring sedimentation and severe weather, active channels require maintenance dredging to ensure that stated depths are at authorized levels. Consequently, the need to maintain channel depth creates a recurring source of dredging work that is non-deferrable if optimal navigability is to be preserved. The Corps is responsible for federally funded projects related to navigation and flood control of U.S. waterways. The maritime industry, including the ports, has repeatedly advocated for congressional efforts to ensure that a fully funded, recurring maintenance program is in place. In March 2018, Congress approved and the President signed an omnibus spending bill through fiscal year 2018. The spending bill continues the increases in the budget for the Corps and exceeds the increase in Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (“HMTF”) spending for maintenance dredging as required by the 2014 Water Resources and Development Act. As noted above, WRDA 2018 was signed into law during the fourth quarter of 2018. Similar to past versions of the bill, WRDA 2018 language calls for full use of the HMTF for its intended purpose of maintaining future access to the waterways and ports that support our nation’s economy. Further, WRDA 2018 ensures that Harbor Maintenance Tax (“HMT”) funding targets will increase by three percent over the prior year, even if the HMT revenue estimates decrease, to continue annual progress towards full use of the HMT by 2025. Through the increased appropriation of HMTF monies, the Company anticipates an increase in harbor projects to be let for bid throughout 2019 and beyond. Congress has improved spending from the HMTF by providing the Corps with record annual budgets including 94% utilization of the HMTF in FY 2018 and 91% proposed in the FY 2019 budget. The annual bid market for maintenance dredging over the prior three years averaged $391 million.

• | Need to maintain safe navigability of the U.S. river system. There are over twelve thousand miles of commercially navigable inland waterways that move more than 566 million tons of commercial goods annually. Transportation by barge requires less energy, and therefore is both better for the environment and costs less to move cargo than transportation by airplane, railcar or truck. Many industries rely on safe navigability of U.S. inland waterways as a primary means to transport goods and commodities such as coal, chemicals, petroleum, minerals, stones, metals and agricultural products. Natural sedimentation and other circumstances require that the inland waterway system be periodically dredged so that it can be used as intended. The Corps recognizes the need to maintain the safe navigability of U.S. waterways. The annual bid market for rivers and lakes dredging over the prior three years averaged $70 million.

• | Domestic and international energy transportation. The growth in demand for transportation of energy worldwide has driven the need for dredging to support new terminals, harbors, channels and pipelines. During 2014, Great Lakes completed dredging work on a project that created a new greenfield port for a liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) terminal developed to export abundant energy resources from the west coast of Australia. The Company was awarded a contract with Corpus Christi Liquefaction, LLC (“CCL”) during 2015. CCL is developing an LNG export terminal at a site located on Corpus Christi Bay in Texas. Great Lakes' portion of the LNG project involves the dredging and slope protection of two LNG carrier ship berths, dredging of a material offloading and tug mooring basin, and expansion of an existing La Quinta Channel turning basin. During 2018, the Company was awarded a project to widen the La Quinta Channel turning basin. The significant drop in crude oil prices in during recent years may lead to a slowdown in the development of LNG export plants; however, the Company continues to expect that future global energy demand will necessitate improvements in the infrastructure base around sources of rich resources and in countries that import global energy.

• | Middle East market. Over the past ten years, the Middle East has been a strong market for dredging services. With substantial income from oil revenues and significant real estate development, these countries have been undergoing extensive infrastructure expansion. Historically lower oil prices and the contraction in Middle East commercial and real estate development have slowed the rate of the region’s infrastructure development in recent years. Despite the decline in recent years, urban development continues to drive the need for land reclamation in the Middle East and the Company expects growth in the area over the next few years.

 For additional details regarding Operations, including financial information regarding our international and U.S. revenues and long-lived assets, see Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Customers
 The dredging industry’s customers include federal, state and local governments, foreign governments and both domestic and foreign private concerns, such as utilities, oil and other energy companies. Most dredging projects are competitively bid, with the award going to the lowest qualified bidder. Customers generally have few economical alternatives to dredging services. The Corps is the largest dredging customer in the U.S. and has responsibility for federally funded projects related to navigation and flood control. In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy are responsible for awarding federal contracts with respect to their own facilities. In 2018, approximately 75% of the Company’s dredging revenues were generated from 30 different contracts with federal agencies or third parties operating under contracts with federal agencies.
Bidding Process
 Most of the Company’s contracts are obtained through competitive bidding on terms specified by the party inviting the bid. The types of equipment required to perform the specified service, project site conditions, the estimated project duration, seasonality, location and complexity of a project affect the cost of performing the contract and the price that dredging contractors will bid.
 For contracts under its jurisdiction, the Corps typically prepares a fair and reasonable cost estimate based on the specifications of the project. To be successful, a bidder must be determined by the Corps to be a responsible bidder (i.e., a bidder that generally has the necessary equipment and experience to successfully complete the project as well as the ability to obtain a surety bid bond) and submit the lowest responsive bid that does not exceed 125% of the Corps’ original estimate. Contracts for state and local governments are generally awarded to the lowest qualified bidder. Contracts for private customers are awarded based on the contractor’s experience, equipment and schedule, as well as price. While substantially all of the Company’s contracts are competitively bid, some government contracts are awarded through a sole source procurement process involving negotiation between the contractor and the government, while other projects are bid by the Corps through a “request for proposal” process. The request for proposal process benefits both Great Lakes and its customers as customers can award contracts based on factors beyond price, including experience, skill and specialized equipment.
 Bonding and Foreign Project Guarantees
 For most domestic projects and some foreign projects, dredging service providers are required to obtain three types of bonds: bid bonds, performance bonds and payment bonds. These bonds are typically provided by large insurance companies. A bid bond is required to serve as a guarantee so that if a service provider’s bid is chosen, the service provider will sign the contract. The amount of the bond is typically 20% of the service provider’s bid, with a range generally between $1 and $10 million. After a contract is signed, the bid bond is replaced by a performance bond, the purpose of which is to guarantee that the job will be completed. If the service provider fails to complete a job, the bonding company would be required to complete the job and would be entitled to be paid the contract price directly by the customer. Additionally, the bonding company would be entitled to be paid by the service provider for any costs incurred in excess of the contract price. A service provider’s ability to obtain performance bonds with respect to a particular contract depends upon the size of the contract, as well as the size of the service provider and its financial position. A payment bond is required to protect the service provider’s suppliers and subcontractors in the event that the service provider cannot make timely payments. Payment bonds are generally written at 100% of the contract value.
 The Company has bonding agreements with Argonaut Insurance Company, Berkley Insurance Company, Chubb Surety and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, (collectively, the “Sureties”) under which the Company can obtain performance, bid and payment bonds. The Company also has outstanding bonds with Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America and Zurich American Insurance Company (“Zurich”). Great Lakes has never experienced difficulty in obtaining bonding for any of its projects and Great Lakes has never failed to complete a marine project in its 128 year history. For most foreign dredging projects, letters of credit or bank guarantees issued by foreign banks are required as security for the bid, performance and, if applicable, advance payment guarantees. The Company obtains its letters of credit under the Credit Agreement (as defined below). Foreign bid guarantees are usually 2% to 5% of the service provider’s bid. Foreign performance and advance payment guarantees are each typically 5% to 10% of the contract value.

Competition
 The U.S. dredging industry is highly fragmented with approximately 250 entities in the U.S. presently operating more than 850 dredges, primarily in maintenance dredging. Most of these dredges are smaller and service the inland, as opposed to coastal, waterways, and therefore do not generally compete with Great Lakes except in our rivers & lakes market. Competition is determined by the size and complexity of the job; equipment bonding and certification requirements; and government regulations. Competition on rivers & lakes projects is determined primarily based on geographic reach, project execution capability and price. Great Lakes and four other companies comprised approximately 85% of the Company’s defined bid market related to domestic capital, coastal protection, maintenance and rivers & lakes over the prior three years. Within the Company’s bid market, competition is determined primarily on the basis of price. In addition, the Foreign Dredge Act of 1906, or “Dredging Act,” and Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, or “Jones Act,” provide significant barriers to entry with respect to foreign competition. Together these two laws prohibit foreign-built, chartered or operated vessels from competing in the U.S. See “Business—Government Regulations” below.
 Competition in the international market is dominated by four large European dredging companies all of which operate larger equipment and fleets that are more extensive than the Company’s fleet. Recently, a large Chinese dredging company has emerged as a key player in the international market. In addition, there are several governmentally supported dredging companies that operate on a local or regional basis. The Company targets opportunities that are well suited to its equipment and where it can be most competitive. Most recently, the Company has focused on opportunities in the Middle East where the Company has cultivated close customer relationships and has pursued contracts compatible with the size of the Company’s vessels.
 Equipment
 Great Lakes’ fleet of dredges, material barges and other specialized equipment is the largest and most diverse in the U.S. The Company operates three principal types of dredging equipment: hopper dredges, hydraulic dredges and mechanical dredges.
 Hopper Dredges. Hopper dredges are typically self-propelled and have the general appearance of an ocean-going vessel. The dredge has hollow hulls, or “hoppers,” into which material is suctioned hydraulically through drag-arms. Once the hoppers are filled, the dredge sails to the designated disposal site and either (i) bottom dumps the material or (ii) pumps the material from the hoppers through a pipeline to a designated site. Hopper dredges can operate in rough waters, are less likely than other types of dredges to interfere with ship traffic, and can be relocated quickly from one project to another. Hopper dredges primarily work on coastal protection and maintenance projects. The Company completed construction of a dual mode articulated tug/barge trailing suction hopper dredge, the Ellis Island, which is the largest domestic hopper dredge, during the fourth quarter of 2017.
 Hydraulic Dredges. Hydraulic dredges remove material using a revolving cutterhead which cuts and churns the sediment on the channel or ocean floor and hydraulically pumps the material by pipe to the disposal location. These dredges are very powerful and can dredge some types of rock. Certain dredged materials can be directly pumped for miles with the aid of multiple booster pumps. Hydraulic dredges work with an assortment of support equipment, which help with the positioning and movement of the dredge, handling of the pipelines and the placement of the dredged material. Unlike hopper dredges, relocating hydraulic dredges and all their ancillary equipment requires specialized vessels and additional time, and their operations can be impacted by ship traffic and rough waters. There is a wide range of hydraulic dredges from our smaller rivers & lakes vessels that use pipe sizes ranging from 10” to 22” and operate at between 365 and 3,200 total horsepower, while the Company’s other hydraulic dredges use pipe sizes ranging from 18” to 36” and operate at between 1,900 and 16,650 total horsepower.
 Mechanical Dredges. There are two basic types of mechanical dredges: clamshell and backhoe. In both types, the dredge uses a bucket to excavate material from the channel or ocean floor. The dredged material is placed by the bucket into material barges, or “scows,” for transport to the designated disposal area. The scows are emptied by bottom-dumping, direct pump-out or removal by a crane with a bucket. Mechanical dredges are capable of removing hard-packed sediments, blasted rock and debris and can work in tight areas such as along docks or terminals. Clamshell dredges with specialized buckets are ideally suited to handle material requiring environmentally controlled disposal. Additionally, the Company owns an electric clamshell dredge which provides an advantage in those markets with stringent emissions standards.
 Scows. The Company has the largest fleet of material barges in the domestic industry, which provides cost advantages when dredged material is required to be disposed far offshore or when material requires controlled disposal.  The Company uses scows with its hydraulic dredges and mechanical dredges.  Scows are an efficient and cost effective way to move material and increase dredging production. The Company has twelve scows in its fleet with a capacity ranging from 5,000 to 8,800 cubic yards.  
 6

In addition, the Company has numerous pieces of smaller equipment that support its dredging operations. Great Lakes’ domestic dredging fleet is typically positioned on the East and Gulf Coasts, with a smaller number of vessels occasionally positioned on the West Coast, and with many of the rivers & lakes dredges on inland rivers and lakes. The mobility of the fleet enables the Company to move equipment in response to changes in demand. Great Lakes’ fleet also includes vessels currently positioned in the Middle East.
 The Company continually assesses its need to upgrade and expand its dredging fleet to take advantage of improving technology and to address the changing needs of the dredging market. The Company is also committed to preventive maintenance, which it believes is reflected in the long lives of most if its equipment and its low level of unscheduled downtime on jobs. To the extent that market conditions warrant the expenditures, Great Lakes can prolong the useful life of its vessels. 
 During 2017, management initiated a strategic review to improve the Company's financial results in both domestic and international operations. As a result of this review, management executed a plan to retire certain underperforming and underutilized assets. The retirement of these underperforming and underutilized assets was substantially completed in 2018.
 Certification of equipment by the U.S. Coast Guard and establishment of the permissible loading capacity by the American Bureau of Shipping (“A.B.S.”) are important factors in the Company’s dredging business. Many projects, such as coastal protection projects with offshore sand borrow sites and dredging projects in exposed entrance channels or with offshore disposal areas, are restricted by federal regulations to be performed only by dredges or scows that have U.S. Coast Guard certification and a load line established by A.B.S. The certifications indicate that the dredge is structurally capable of operating in open waters. The Company has more certified dredging vessels than any of the Company’s domestic competitors and makes substantial investments to maintain these certifications.
 Seasonality
 Seasonality generally does not have a significant impact on the Company’s operations. However, many East Coast coastal protection projects are limited by environmental windows that require work to be performed in winter months to protect wildlife habitats. The Company can mitigate the impact of these environmental restrictions to a certain extent because the Company has the flexibility to reposition its equipment to project sites, if available, that are not limited by these restrictions. In addition, rivers and lakes in the northern U.S. freeze during the winter, significantly reducing the Company’s ability to operate and transport its equipment in the relevant geographies. Fish spawning and flooding can affect dredging operations as well. 
Weather
 The Company’s ability to perform its contracts may depend on weather conditions. Inclement or hazardous weather conditions can delay the completion of a project, can result in disruption or early termination of a project, unanticipated recovery costs or liability exposure and additional costs. As part of bidding on fixed price contracts, the Company makes allowances, consistent with historical weather data, for project downtime due to adverse weather conditions. In the event that the Company experiences adverse weather beyond these allowances, a project may require additional days to complete, resulting in additional costs and decreased gross profit margins. Conversely, favorable weather can accelerate the completion of the project, resulting in cost savings and increased gross profit margins. Typically, Great Lakes is exposed to significant weather in the first and fourth quarters, and certain projects are required to be performed in environmental windows that occur during these periods. See “Business-Seasonality” above.
 Weather is difficult to predict and historical records exist for only the last 100-125 years. Changes in weather patterns may cause a deviation from project weather allowances on a more frequent basis and consequently increase or decrease gross profit margin, as applicable, on a project-by-project basis. In a typical year, the Company works on many projects in multiple geographic locations and experiences both positive and negative deviations from project weather allowances. Accordingly, it is unlikely that future climate change will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.
 Backlog
 The Company’s contract backlog represents its estimate of the revenues that will be realized under the portion of the contracts remaining to be performed. These estimates are based primarily upon the time and costs required to mobilize the necessary assets to and from the project site, the amount and type of material to be dredged and the expected production capabilities of the equipment performing the work. However, these estimates are necessarily subject to variances based upon actual circumstances. Because of these factors, as well as factors affecting the time required to complete each job, backlog is not always indicative of future revenues or profitability. In addition, a significant amount of the Company’s backlog relates to federal government contracts, which can be canceled at any time without penalty, subject to the Company’s right, in some cases, to recover the Company’s actual committed costs and profit on work performed up to the date of cancellation. The Company’s backlog may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based upon the type and size of the projects the Company is awarded from the bid market. A quarterly increase or decrease of the Company’s backlog does not necessarily result in an improvement or a deterioration of the Company’s business. The Company’s 
 7

backlog includes only those projects for which the Company has obtained a signed contract with the customer. The components of the Company’s backlog including dollar amount and other related information are addressed in more detail in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Bidding Activity and Backlog.”
 Employees
 At December 31, 2018, the Company employed 399 full-time salaried personnel in the U.S., including those in a corporate function. In addition, the Company employs U.S. hourly personnel, most of whom are unionized, on a project-by-project basis. Crews are generally available for hire on relatively short notice. During 2018, the Company employed an average of approximately 684 hourly personnel to meet domestic project requirements.
 At December 31, 2018, the Company employed 8 expatriates, 15 foreign nationals and 41 local staff to manage and administer its Middle East operations. During 2018, the Company also employed a daily average of 45 hourly personnel to meet project requirements in the Middle East.
 Safety
 Safety of its employees is one of the Company’s core values. The Company employs behavioral and system based programs utilizing an Incident & Injury Free® (IIF) approach. The Company’s safety culture is committed to training, behavioral based awareness and mutual responsibility for the wellbeing of its employees. The Company’s goal is sustainable safety excellence. Incident prevention in all areas have top priority in the Company’s business planning, in the overall conduct of its business, and in the operation and maintenance of our equipment (marine and land) and facilities.
Unions
 The Company is a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. that govern its relationships with its unionized hourly workforce. However, two unions represent a large majority of our dredging employees - the International Union of Operating Engineers (“IUOE”), Local 25 and the Seafarers International Union. The Company’s master contract with IUOE, Local 25 was ratified in February 2019 and expires in September 2021. Two ancillary contracts with IUOE, Local 25 expired in September 2018 and will be re-negotiated now that the master contract is completed. Our agreements with Seafarers International Union expire in February 2023. The Company has not experienced any major labor disputes in the past five years and believes it has good relationships with the unions that represent a significant number of its hourly employees; however, there can be no assurances that the Company will not experience labor strikes or disturbances in the future.
Government Regulations
 The Company is subject to government regulations pursuant to the Dredging Act, the Jones Act, the Shipping Act, 1916, or “Shipping Act,” and the vessel documentation laws set forth in Chapter 121 of Title 46 of the United States Code. These statutes require vessels engaged in dredging in the navigable waters of the United States to be documented with a coastwise endorsement, to be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens, to be manned by U.S. crews, and to be built in the United States. The U.S. citizen ownership and control standards require the vessel-owning entity to be at least 75% U.S. citizen owned and prohibit the chartering of the vessel to any entity that does not meet the 75% U.S. citizen ownership test.
Environmental Matters
 The Company’s operations, facilities and vessels are subject to various environmental laws and regulations related to, among other things: dredging operations; the disposal of dredged material; protection of wetlands; storm water and waste water discharges; demolition activities; asbestos removal; transportation and disposal of wastes and materials; air emissions; and remediation of contaminated soil, sediments, surface water and groundwater. The Company is also subject to laws designed to protect certain marine species and habitats. Compliance with these statutes and regulations can delay appropriation and/or performance of particular projects and increase related project costs. Non-compliance can also result in fines, penalties and claims by third parties seeking damages for alleged personal injury, as well as damages to property and natural resources.
 Certain environmental laws such as the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 impose strict and, under some circumstances joint and several, liability on owners and operators of facilities and vessels for investigation and remediation of releases and discharges of regulated materials, and also impose liability for related damages to natural resources. The Company’s past and ongoing operations involve the use, and from time to time the release or discharge, of regulated materials which could result in liability under these and other environmental laws. The Company has remediated known releases and discharges as deemed necessary, but there can be no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred if, for example, third party claims arise or new conditions are discovered.

The Company’s projects may involve remediation, demolition, excavation, transportation, management and disposal of hazardous waste and other regulated materials. Various laws strictly regulate the removal, treatment and transportation of hazardous water and other regulated materials and impose liability for human health effects and environmental contamination caused by these materials. The Company takes steps to limit its potential liability by hiring qualified subcontractors from time to time to remove such materials from our projects, and some project contracts require the client to retain liability for hazardous waste generation.
 Based on the Company’s experience and available information, the Company believes that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations (and liability for known environmental conditions) will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the Company cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with these environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or to respond to newly discovered conditions, such as future cleanup matters or other environmental claims.
