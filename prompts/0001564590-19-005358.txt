Motion Picture Exhibition Industry Overview
 Domestic Markets
 The U.S. motion picture exhibition industry reported box office revenues of approximately $11.1 billion for 2017.  Preliminary estimates for 2018 indicate that box office revenues reached an all-time high of $11.9 billion, an approximate 7% increase over 2017. The following table represents the results of a survey by MPAA published during March 2018, outlining the historical trends in U.S. box office performance for the ten year period from 2008 to 2017 (industry data for 2018 has not yet been released):

 | U.S. Box | | | | | | 
-----+-----------------+------+---------------+------+----------------+---+-----
 | Office Revenues | | Attendance | | Average Ticket
Year | ($ in billions) | | (in billions) | | Price 
2008 | $ | 9.6 | | 1.34 | | $ | 7.18
2009 | $ | 10.6 | | 1.42 | | $ | 7.50
2010 | $ | 10.6 | | 1.34 | | $ | 7.89
2011 | $ | 10.2 | | 1.28 | | $ | 7.93
2012 | $ | 10.8 | | 1.36 | | $ | 7.96
2013 | $ | 10.9 | | 1.34 | | $ | 8.13
2014 | $ | 10.4 | | 1.27 | | $ | 8.17
2015 | $ | 11.1 | | 1.32 | | $ | 8.43
2016 | $ | 11.4 | | 1.32 | | $ | 8.65
2017 | $ | 11.1 | | 1.24 | | $ | 8.97

 Over the past ten years, industry statistics have shown slight increases and decreases in attendance from one year to another, however domestic box office revenues have remained relatively stable during this period.  The industry has not experienced highly volatile results, even during recessionary periods, demonstrating the stability of the industry, its continued ability to attract consumers and the fact that box office performance is primarily dependent on the quality and quantity of film product rather than economic cycles.  Average ticket prices can also be driven by the mix of film product and availability of films in premium formats.
 Films leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2018 included Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, Incredibles 2, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Aquaman, Deadpool 2, Dr. Seuss’ The Grinch, Mission Impossible – Fallout, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Venom, A Quiet Place, Crazy Rich Asians, Halloween, Bumblebee, Ralph Breaks the Internet, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, Mary Poppins Returns, A Star is Born, Bohemian Rhapsody and other films, as well as the carryover of The Greatest Showman, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and Star Wars: The Last Jedi.
 Films scheduled for release during 2019 include Avengers: Endgame, Star Wars: Episode IX, The Lion King, Frozen 2, Toy Story 4, Aladdin, Captain Marvel, It 2, Spider-Man: Far From Home, The Secret Life of Pets 2, Joker, Dumbo, and Godzilla 2 among other films.
 International Markets
 According to MPAA, international box office revenues increased approximately 7% to $29.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $27.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016.  More specifically, Latin American box office revenues were $3.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately 22%.  (Industry data for 2018 has not yet been released.)
 While certain Latin American countries have experienced recent political and economic challenges, performance is also impacted by social behaviors, growing populations, continued retail development in select markets, and quality product from Hollywood, including 3-D and alternative content offerings. In many Latin American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Chile, successful local film product can also provide incremental box office growth opportunities.

We believe many international markets will expand as new theatre technologies are introduced to more locations, as film and other content offerings continue to broaden, as ancillary revenue opportunities grow and as local economies strengthen. We also believe most of these markets are underscreened in comparison to the U.S. and European markets.
 Drivers of Continued Industry Success
 We believe the following market trends will continue to drive the strength of our industry:
 Importance of Theatrical Success in Establishing Movie Brands. Theatrical exhibition has long been the primary distribution channel for new major motion picture releases. A successful theatrical release “brands” a film and is one of the major contributors to a film’s success in “downstream” markets, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs, SVOD, and network and syndicated television, as well as branded retail merchandise.
 Convenient and Affordable Form of Out-Of-Home Entertainment.  Movie going continues to be one of the most convenient and affordable forms of out-of-home entertainment, with an estimated average ticket price in the U.S. of $8.97 in 2017. Average prices in 2017 for other forms of out-of-home entertainment in the U.S., including sporting events and theme parks, ranged from approximately $31.67 to $94.98 per ticket according to MPAA. (As of the date of this report, 2018 industry data was not yet available.)
 Expansion of Concepts and Product Offerings that Enhance the Movie-Going Experience.  The motion picture exhibition industry continues to develop new movie theatre platforms and concepts to respond to varying and changing consumer preferences and to continue to differentiate the movie-going experience from watching a movie at home. In addition to changing the overall style of, and amenities offered in, some theatres, concession product offerings have continued to expand to more than just traditional popcorn and candy items. Many locations now offer hot foods, alcohol offerings and/or healthier snack options for guests.  Motion seats are offered in some locations, further enhancing the movie viewing experience. Virtual reality has also been developed for in-theatre enjoyment. New and enhanced programming alternatives expand the industry’s entertainment offerings to attract a broader customer base.   
 Contribution of International Markets to Box Office Performance. International markets continue to be an increasingly important component of the overall box office revenues generated by Hollywood films, accounting for $29.5 billion, or approximately 73%, of 2017 total worldwide box office revenues according to MPAA. (As of the date of this report, 2018 industry data was not yet available.) With the meaningful contribution of the international motion picture exhibition industry, we believe the relative contribution of markets outside North America will continue to be impactful. Many of the top U.S. films released during 2018 also performed exceptionally well in international markets.  Avengers: Infinity War grossed $1,370.0 million in international markets, or 67% of its worldwide box office.   Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom generated $887.1 million in international markets, or 68% of its worldwide box office.  Aquaman generated $774.2 million in international markets, or 71% of its worldwide box office.
 Our Strategy
 Key components of our strategy include:
 Focus on Providing an Extraordinary Guest Experience to Maximize Attendance. We differentiate our theatres by focusing on providing an extraordinary guest experience through a variety of initiatives, as discussed below. We believe our focus on the guest experience is a catalyst for attendance growth and is a primary factor in our consistent industry-leading results.

• | We have a market-adaptive approach with our theatre amenities, including Luxury Lounger recliner seats, enhanced food and beverage offerings, and our exhibitor-branded premium large format, XD, IMAX, motion seats, and a new virtual reality offering in one of our domestic theatres. Our innovative and advanced technology selections allow us to consistently deliver the highest quality presentation to fully immerse our guests in the on-screen action. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | We have taken a retail approach to our food and beverage offerings, which include the traditional concession items such as popcorn, soft drinks and candy as well as enhanced menu items, alcohol and various cultural foods. We also have merchandise stands in most theatres, bringing apparel, toys and other unique movie-themed products to our guests. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Through our various marketing initiatives, including enhanced and tailored customer interactions, continued investment in our website and app experiences and development of our loyalty and membership programs, we are dedicated to further understanding our guests and enriching their movie-going experience. We are also committed to providing a great employee experience through ongoing training, incentive programs and offering a supportive environment, as our engaged employees are empowered to provide first-rate customer service to our guests. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sustained Investment in Core Circuit Combined with Targeted Growth. We continually utilize our cash flows from operations to invest in our circuit to ensure the highest quality experience for our guests.  Our commitment to investing in our theatre assets is demonstrated by our level of capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, at approximately $380.9 million and $346.1 million, respectively. We selectively build or acquire new theatres in markets where we can establish and maintain a strong market position. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we built eleven new theatres with 81 screens and acquired three theatres with 19 screens. 
Competitive Strengths
 We believe the following strengths allow us to compete effectively: 
 Disciplined Operating Philosophy. We generated operating income and net income attributable to Cinemark Holdings, Inc. of $388.3 million and $213.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our solid operating performance is a result of our disciplined and consistent operating philosophy that centers on building new, and reinvesting in our existing, high-quality theatres, focusing on the guest experience, maintaining favorable theatre-level economics, controlling operating costs and effectively reacting to economic and market changes. 
 We continue to grow organically as well as through the acquisition of high-quality theatres in select markets.  Our growth strategy has centered around meeting our stringent return on investment thresholds while also complementing our existing theatre circuit.  We continue to generate consistent cash flows from operating activities, which demonstrates the success of our growth strategy. We believe the combination of our strong balance sheet and our continued commitment to earn a strong return on our capital investments, will continue to provide us with the financial flexibility to pursue further expansion opportunities and maintain our existing locations at a high standard, while also allowing us to effectively service our debt obligations and continue to offer our stockholders a strong dividend yield. 
 Leading Position in Our U.S. Markets. We have a leading market share in most of the U.S. markets we serve, which includes a presence in 41 states. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we ranked either first or second, based on box office revenues, in 20 out of our top 25 U.S. markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area, Dallas, Houston, Salt Lake City, Sacramento, Cleveland, Austin and Las Vegas.
 Located in Top Latin American Markets. We have successfully established a significant presence in major cities in Latin America, with theatres in fourteen of the twenty largest metropolitan areas in South America. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 205 theatres and 1,462 screens in 15 countries. Our international screens generated revenues of $682.8 million, or 21.2% of our total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2018. We are the largest exhibitor in Brazil and Argentina and have significant market presence in Colombia, Peru and Chile. Our geographic diversity makes us an important global distribution channel for the movie studios.
 State-of-the-Art Theatre Circuit. We offer a state-of-the-art movie-going experience, which we believe makes our theatres a preferred destination for moviegoers in our markets. During 2018, we built 81 new screens worldwide. As of December 31, 2018, we had commitments to open 212 additional new screens over the next three years. 
 5


We have incorporated Luxury Lounger recliner seats in all of our recent domestic new builds and have also repositioned many of our existing domestic theatres to offer this premium seating feature. We currently feature Luxury Loungers in 2,565 domestic auditoriums, representing 55.9% of our domestic circuit. We plan to continue to add additional Luxury Loungers in certain of our domestic locations during 2019. 
 Our XD screens represent the largest exhibitor-sponsored premium large format footprint in the industry. Our XD auditoriums offer a premium experience utilizing the latest in digital projection and enhanced custom sound, including a Barco Auro 11.1 or Dolby Atmos sound system in select locations. The XD experience includes wall-to-wall screens, wrap-around sound, plush seating and a maximum comfort entertainment environment for an immersive experience. The exceptional XD technology does not require special format movie prints, which allows us the flexibility to showcase any available digital print we choose, including 3-D content, in our XD auditoriums. We also prefer the economies of our exhibitor-sponsored format since there is no additional revenue share component outside of routine film rental. As of December 31, 2018, we had 256 XD auditoriums in our worldwide circuit.   We expect to further expand our XD footprint during 2019.
 We offer enhanced food and beverages such as fresh wraps, hot sandwiches, burgers, and gourmet pizzas, and a selection of beers, wines, and frozen cocktails, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of the auditoriums, at approximately 58% of our worldwide theatres. We also offer market-adaptive concepts with full bars or dine-in areas in certain of our theatres, and continue to expand to additional locations. 
 We currently have auditoriums that offer seats with immersive cinematic motion, which we refer to as motion seats, throughout our worldwide circuit. These motion seats are programmed in harmony with the audio and video content of the film and further immerse guests in the on-screen action. We offer motion seats in 229 auditoriums throughout our worldwide circuit. We plan to add motion seats to additional locations during 2019.  
 During 2018, we collaborated on an in-theatre immersive virtual reality technology in one of our domestic theatres that takes guests on a real-life, full-body journey where they engage with characters and their environment through sight, sound, touch, smell and motion. We plan to install this technology in at least one additional domestic theatre during 2019 and we are continuing to evaluate other locations at which we can offer our guests this unique entertainment option.
 Experienced Management. Led by Chairman and founder Lee Roy Mitchell, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zoradi, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Sean Gamble, and President-International Valmir Fernandes, our operational management team has many years of industry experience.  Each of our international offices is led by general managers that are local citizens familiar with cultural, political and economic factors impacting each country. Our worldwide management team has successfully navigated us through many industry and economic cycles over the years.

 We first entered Latin America when we opened a theatre in Chile in 1993. Since then, through our focused international growth strategy, we have developed one of the most geographically diverse theatre circuits in the region. We have balanced our risk through a diversified international portfolio, which includes theatres in fourteen of the twenty largest metropolitan areas in South America. We have established significant presence in Brazil and Argentina, where we are the largest exhibitor. We also have significant market presence in Colombia, Peru and Chile. 
 We believe that certain markets within Latin America continue to be underserved as penetration of movie screens per capita in these markets is substantially lower than in the U.S. and European markets. We intend to continue to expand our presence in international markets, with emphasis on Latin America, and fund our expansion primarily with cash flow generated from operations. We are able to mitigate cash flow exposure to currency fluctuations by transacting local operating expenses primarily in their respective local currencies. Our geographic diversity throughout South and Central America has allowed us to maintain consistent local currency revenue performance, notwithstanding currency and economic fluctuations that may affect any particular market. 
 Content 
 We offer a variety of content at our theatres.  We monitor upcoming films and other content and work diligently with film distributors to license the content that we believe will be most successful in our theatres. We play mainstream films from many different genres, such as animated films, family films, dramas, comedies, horror and action films. We offer content in both 2-D and 3-D formats in all of our theatres, and in many locations, we offer our exhibitor-branded premium large format, XD. We also offer a format that features motion seats and added sensory features in addition to the ultra-realistic images of 3-D technology in select locations.
 We regularly play art and independent films at many of our U.S. theatres and offer local film product in our international markets, providing a variety of film choices to our guests. We offer a Classic Series at a majority of our U.S. theatres and some of our international theatres, which involves playing digitally re-mastered classic movies that change on a weekly basis. The program covers a variety of genres of classic films that are generally exhibited during non-peak times.
 Our joint venture, AC JV, LLC, with Regal Entertainment Group, or Regal, and AMC Entertainment, Inc., or AMC, provides marketing and distribution of live and pre-recorded entertainment programming to movie theatres to augment theatres’ feature film schedules, which includes the Metropolitan Opera, sports programs, concert events, e-sports gaming events and other special presentations, that may be live or pre-recorded. We, along with AC JV, LLC, continue to identify new ways to utilize our theatre platform to provide entertainment to consumers.

Film Licensing
 In the domestic marketplace, our corporate film department negotiates with film distributors to license films for each of our domestic theatres. In each of our international offices, our local film personnel negotiate with local offices of major film distributors as well as local film distributors to license films for our international theatres. Film distributors are responsible for determining film release dates and film marketing campaigns and the related expenditures, while we are responsible for booking the films at each of our theatres at the optimal showtimes for our guests. In most instances, we are able to license each first-run, wide-release film without regard to the bookings of other exhibitors within that area. In certain limited situations, our theatres compete with other nearby theatres for film content from film distributors. We face competition for patrons from other exhibitors and other forms of entertainment, as discussed under Competition below, at all of our theatres in all markets. Our theatre personnel focus on providing an extraordinary guest experience, and we provide a high-quality facility with the most up-to-date sound systems, comfortable seating and other amenities preferred by our guests, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in markets where competing theatres play the same films. 
 In both our domestic and international locations, we pay film rental fees based on a film’s box office receipts at our theatres. Film rental rates are negotiated based on either a sliding scale formula under which the rate is based on a standard rate matrix that is established prior to a film’s run; a firm terms formula, as determined prior to a film’s run, under which we pay a negotiated rate; or a rate that is negotiated after a film’s run.  
 Food and Beverage 
 Concession sales are our second largest revenue source, consistently representing approximately 35% of total revenues. We have devoted considerable management effort to expanding concession sales by enhancing our offerings and adapting to our customers’ changing preferences, as discussed below. 
 Concession Product Mix. Common concession products offered at all of our theatres may include various sizes and types of popcorn, soft drinks, coffees, non-carbonated drinks, candy and quickly-prepared or pre-prepared food, such as hot dogs, pizza, pretzel bites, nachos and ice cream. The food and beverage offerings vary based on consumer preferences in a particular market. We have introduced some healthier snack and beverage options for our guests, which are available at some locations, added alcohol offerings in a growing number of theatres, and also offer diverse ethnic foods based on market demographics. 
 In select locations, we have expanded concession product offerings to include a broader variety of food and drink options, such as fresh wraps, hot sandwiches, burgers, gourmet pizzas, and a selection of beers, wines, and frozen cocktails, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of the auditoriums.  We also have lobby bars and VIP lounges in many domestic and international theatres.
 Our proprietary point-of-sale system allows our category managers to monitor product sales and readily make adjustments to product mix on a theatre-by-theatre or market-by-market basis, when necessary. This program flexibility also allows us to efficiently activate and manage both national or regional product launches and promotional initiatives to further grow food and beverage sales.  
 Pricing. New products and promotions are introduced on a regular basis to increase concession purchase incidence by existing buyers as well as to attract new buyers. We offer specially-priced product combinations at our theatres. We routinely offer discounts to our guests on certain products by offering weekly coupons as well as reusable popcorn tubs and soft drink cups that can be refilled at a discounted price. In certain international countries and in all of our domestic theatres, we offer a loyalty program that periodically offers food and beverage discounts. Our new Cinemark Movie Club membership program also allows our domestic guests to sign-up for exclusive concessions discounts.
 Staff Training. Employees are continually trained in proper sales techniques, food preparation and handling and maintaining concession product quality. Some of our product promotions include a motivational element that rewards theatre staff for exceptional sales of certain promotional items. 
 9


Theatre Design. Our theatres are designed to optimize the guest purchase experience at the concession stands, which includes multiple concession counters throughout a theatre to facilitate serving guests in an expedited manner. We strategically place large concession stands within theatres to heighten visibility, reduce the length of concession lines, and improve traffic flow around the concession stands. We incorporate self-serve candy cases and bottled drink coolers at our traditional crew-serve theatres to help provide convenience for our guests, drive purchase incidence and increase product availability for these two core categories. We also have self-service cafeteria-style concession areas in many of our domestic theatres, which allow customers to select their own refreshments and proceed to the cash register when they are ready. This design allows for more efficient service, and superior visibility of concession items. In some of our international locations, we allow guests to pre-order concession items, either online or at a kiosk, and pick them up in a dedicated line at the concession counter.  
 Cost Control. We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume discounts and also negotiate volume-based and promotional-based rebates with our larger suppliers. Concession supplies are generally distributed through a distribution network. The concession distributor delivers inventory to the theatres after receiving orders directly from the theatres or through an online electronic ordering system.  We conduct frequent inventory counts of concession products at every theatre to ensure proper stock levels are maintained to appropriately serve our guests.
Pre-Feature Screen Advertising
 In our domestic markets, our theatres are part of the in-theatre digital network operated by National CineMedia, LLC, or NCM. NCM provides advertising to our theatres through its branded “Noovie” pre-show entertainment program and also handles lobby promotions and displays for our theatres. We believe that the reach, scope and digital delivery capability of NCM’s network provides an effective platform for national, regional and local advertisers to reach our audience. We receive a monthly theatre access fee for participation in the NCM network and also earn screen advertising revenue on a per patron basis. As of December 31, 2018, we had an approximate 25% ownership interest in NCM. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investment in NCM.
 In our international markets, our wholly-owned subsidiary Flix Media Publicidade E Entretenimento, Ltda., or Flix Media, handles our screen advertising functions in Brazil. Our Flix Media marketing personnel work with local agencies and advertisers to coordinate screen advertising in our Brazil theatres. We have expanded the Flix Media advertising services to other exhibitors in Brazil through revenue share agreements. In Argentina, we have in-house personnel that work with local advertisers to arrange screen advertising in our Argentina theatres. We also operate advertising subsidiaries that support our theatres in Chile, Central America, Colombia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Ecuador and Curacao. In Chile, our Flix subsidiary also represents Cinepolis, making our subsidiary the local leader in cinema advertising.  In addition to screen advertising in our theatres, we intend to expand Flix Media’s services to include, among other things, alternative content, digital media and other synergistic media opportunities. In a few of our other international markets, we outsource our screen advertising to local companies who have established relationships with local advertisers that provide similar programming benefits. The terms of our international screen advertising contracts vary by country, however, we generally earn a percentage of the screen advertising revenues for access to our screens. 
 Marketing and Promotions
 We generally market our theatres and special events, including new theatre grand openings, remodel openings and VIP events, using email, organic and paid digital advertising, directory film schedules, and radio and television advertising spots. We exhibit previews of coming attractions and current films as part of our on-screen pre-feature program. We offer guests access to movie times, the ability to buy their tickets and reserve their seats in advance and purchase gift cards at our website www.cinemark.com and via our smart phone and tablet applications. Customers can subscribe to our weekly emails to receive information about current and upcoming films at their preferred Cinemark theatre(s), including details about upcoming Cinemark XD movies, advanced ticket sales, screenings, special events, concerts and live broadcasts; as well as contests, promotions, and coupons for concession savings. Email communications and push notifications are utilized to provide customers with the latest information or exclusive offers such as screenings, contests or promotions. We partner with film distributors on a regular basis to promote upcoming films through local, regional and national programs that are exclusive to our theatres. These programs may involve customer contests that include exclusive giveaways, cross-promotions with the media and other third parties and other means to impact patronage for films showing at our theatres. 
 10


We interact with guests every day on social media platforms, such as Facebook, on which we recently reached nine million followers, Twitter and Instagram.  Through social media, we provide relevant information, quick access to advanced ticketing information and upcoming movies and events, as well as to respond to guest feedback. Guests can also utilize social media to ask us questions regarding their local Cinemark theatre offerings, movie-related information or to provide suggestions.
 We launched a subscription membership program for our domestic circuit in December 2017.  Cinemark Movie Club offers guests a monthly fixed-price 2D ticket, member-pricing for a companion ticket and concession and other transaction discounts.  Cinemark Movie Club is a unique option to reward our loyal guests and allows us to stay informed of our frequent guests’ preferences.
 We offer a free domestic loyalty program to our guests, called Connections, which was launched in 2016. Connections allows our guests to earn points for different types of transactions as tracked through our Cinemark smart phone app.  Points can then be redeemed for tickets, concession items and discounts, as well as unique and limited edition experiential rewards that relate to films currently playing at our theatres. 
 We also have loyalty programs in most of our international markets that either allow customers to pay a nominal fee for an annual membership card that provides them with certain admissions and concession discounts or that allows guests to earn loyalty points for each purchase. Similar to the Connections program, our points-based international programs offer discounts on movie tickets and concessions. Our global loyalty programs put us in direct contact with our guests and provides additional opportunities for us to partner with the studios and our vendors through targeted promotions. 
 Our domestic and international marketing departments also focus on expanding ancillary revenue, which includes the sale of our gift cards and our SuperSaver discount tickets. We generally market these programs to businesses as an employee-incentive or rewards program. Our marketing departments also coordinate the use of our auditoriums, generally during off-peak times, for corporate meetings, private movie screenings, brand and product launches, education and training sessions or other private events, which contribute to our ancillary revenue.  
 Competition
 We are one of the leaders in the motion picture exhibition industry. We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors with respect to attracting guests, licensing films and developing new theatre sites. Our primary U.S. competitors include Regal and AMC and our primary international competitors, which vary by country, include Cinépolis, Cine Colombia, CinePlanet, Kinoplex (GSR), and Araujo.
 We are generally able to book films without regard to the film bookings of other exhibitors at many of our theatres. In certain limited situations, distributors allocate movies to only one theatre in a market generally based on demographics, the conditions, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and the terms of exhibition. In all theatres, our success in attracting guests can depend on customer service quality, location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability and ticket prices. 
 We compete for new theatre sites with other movie theatre exhibitors as well as other entertainment venues. Securing a potential site depends upon factors such as committed investment and resources, theatre design and capacity, revenue potential, and financial stability.  
 We face competition for patrons from a number of alternative film distribution channels, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs, SVOD, network and syndicated television. We also face competition from other forms of entertainment competing for the public’s leisure time and disposable income, such as family entertainment centers, concerts, theme parks and sporting events.

Seasonality
 Our revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors. Generally, the most successful motion pictures have been released during summer months in the U.S., extending from May to July, and during the holiday season, extending from November through year-end. The timing of releases, however, has become less pronounced as distributors have begun releasing content more evenly throughout the year.  In our Latin American markets, while Hollywood content has similar release dates as in the U.S., the local holidays and seasons can vary. The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can impact this seasonality trend. The timing and quality of film releases can have a significant impact on our results of operations, and the results of one period are not necessarily indicative of results for the following period or for the same period in the following year.
Corporate Operations
 Our worldwide headquarters, referred to as the Cinemark Service Center, is located in Plano, Texas. Personnel at the Cinemark Service Center provide oversight and support for our domestic and international theatres, including our executive team and department heads in charge of film licensing, food and beverage, theatre operations, theatre construction and maintenance, real estate, human resources, marketing, legal, finance, accounting, tax and information technology. Our U.S. operations are comprised of twenty regions, each of which is headed by a regional vice president. We have nine regional offices in Latin America responsible for the local management of theatres in fifteen countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala and Curacao are managed out of one Central American regional office). Each regional office is headed by a general manager with additional personnel responsible for film licensing, marketing, human resources, information technology, operations and finance. We have divisional chief financial officers in Brazil and Argentina and a regional chief financial officer located in Chile that oversees Chile, Bolivia and Paraguay. 
Employees
 We have approximately 20,000 employees in the U.S., approximately 21% of whom are full time employees and 79% of whom are part time employees. We have approximately 9,500 employees in our international markets, approximately 78% of whom are full time employees and approximately 22% of whom are part time employees. Due to the seasonal nature of our business as discussed above, our headcount can vary throughout the year, depending on the timing and success of movie releases. Some of our international locations are subject to union regulations. We regard our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
Regulations
 The distribution of motion pictures is largely regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases. The manner in which we can license films from certain major film distributors has been influenced by consent decrees resulting from these cases. Consent decrees bind certain major film distributors and require the films of such distributors to be offered and licensed to exhibitors, including Cinemark, on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis. Consequently, exhibitors cannot enter into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
 We are subject to various general regulations applicable to our operations including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, and regulations recently issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that require nutrition labels for certain menu items. Our domestic and international theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship, health and sanitation requirements and various business licensing and permitting.
