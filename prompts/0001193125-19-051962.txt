 Our main operating subsidiaries include JOTEC GmbH (JOTEC), a Hechingen, Germany-based endovascular and surgical products company acquired on December 1, 2017 and On-X Life Technologies Holdings, Inc. (On-X), an Austin, Texas-based, mechanical heart valve company acquired on January 20, 2016, as well as separate country entities to support direct sales operations in Brazil, Canada, France, Italy, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the U.K. Our subsidiary, CryoLife Asia Pacific, Pte. Ltd., (Asia Pacific), provides sales and marketing support for the Asia Pacific region. 
Segments and Geographic Information 
 We have two reportable segments organized according to our products and services: Medical Devices and Preservation Services. The Medical Devices segment includes revenues from sales of BioGlue; JOTEC products; On-X products; CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy; PerClot; and PhotoFix. The Preservation Services segment includes services revenues from the preservation of cardiac and vascular tissues. See also Part II, Item 8, Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our segments and for our geographic information. 
Strategy 
 Our strategic plan is focused on four growth areas in the cardiac and vascular surgery space that we expect to drive our business expansion in the near term. These four growth areas and their key elements are described below: 

 | New Products  Drive growth through new products, including JOTEC and On-X products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | New Indications  Drive growth by broadening the reach of some of our products and services, including the JOTEC, On-X, and BioGlue products, and preserved cardiac and vascular tissues, with new or expanded approvals and indications in the U.S. or in international markets;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Global Expansion  Drive growth by expanding our current products and services into new markets, including emerging markets, and developing new direct sales territories overseas; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Business Development  Drive growth through business development by selectively pursuing potential acquisitions, licensing, or distribution rights of companies or technologies that complement our existing products, services, and infrastructure and expand our footprint in the cardiac and vascular surgery spaces, as we did with the recent acquisitions of JOTEC and On-X; and licensing of products developed internally with non-cardiac or non-vascular indications. To the extent we identify new non-core products or additional applications for our core products, we may attempt to license these products to corporate partners for further development or seek funding from outside sources to continue commercial development.

Markets, Products, Services, and Competition 
 Our medical devices and preservation services are primarily used by cardiac and vascular surgeons to treat patients with aortic disease, including heart valve disease, and to a lesser extent, peripheral vascular disease and other conditions. 
 We face competition from several domestic and international medical device, pharmaceutical, and biopharmaceutical companies and from both for-profit and non-profit tissue banks. Many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial and personnel resources than we have. Some of these competitors might have greater 
 
5 
 
 experience in developing products, procuring tissues, conducting clinical trials, and obtaining regulatory approvals, and they might have large contracts with hospitals under which they can impose purchase requirements that place our products at a disadvantage. Some of these competitors might obtain patent protection or approval or clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or foreign regulators sooner than we do. Some might have superior manufacturing efficiency, tissue processing capacity, and/or marketing capabilities. Some might be developing additional competitive products that could compete with our products or services in the future. We cannot assure that our current or future competitors will not succeed in developing alternative technologies, products, or services that have significant advantages over those that have been, or are being, developed by us or that would render our products or technology obsolete and non-competitive. Any of these competitive disadvantages could materially, adversely affect us. 
 We discuss each market in which we compete and our products, services, and/or technologies with which we compete in each market below. 
 Cardiac Surgery Markets 
 Surgical Sealants 
 Closing internal wounds effectively following surgical procedures is critical to the restoration of the function of tissue and to the ultimate success of the surgical procedure. Failure to seal surgical wounds effectively can result in leakage of blood in cardiac surgeries, air in lung surgeries, cerebrospinal fluid in neurosurgeries, and gastrointestinal contents in abdominal surgeries. Fluid, air, and content leakage resulting from surgical procedures can lead to prolonged hospitalization, higher levels of post-operative pain, higher costs, and higher mortality rates. 
 Sutures and staples facilitate healing by joining wound edges to allow the body to heal naturally. Sutures and staples, however, cannot consistently eliminate air and fluid leakage at the wound site, particularly when used to close tissues containing air or fluids under pressure, such as in blood vessels, the lobes of the lung, the dural membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord, and the gastrointestinal tract. In some cases, the tissues may be friable, which complicates surgical wound closure. In addition, it can be difficult and time consuming for the physician to apply sutures and staples in minimally invasive surgical procedures where the physician must operate through small access openings. We believe that the use of surgical adhesives and sealants, with or without sutures and staples, in certain areas can enhance the efficacy of these procedures through more effective and rapid wound closure. 
 BioGlue 
 Our proprietary product, BioGlue, is a polymer consisting of bovine blood protein and an agent for cross-linking proteins, which was developed for use in cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, and general surgical applications. BioGlue has a tensile strength that is four to five times that of fibrin sealants, and it is stronger than other cardiovascular sealants. BioGlue begins to polymerize within 20 to 30 seconds and reaches its bonding strength within two minutes. BioGlue is dispensed by a controlled delivery system that consists of a disposable syringe and various applicator tips. BioGlue is pre-filled in 2ml, 5ml, and 10ml volumes. 
 BioGlue is FDA approved as an adjunct to sutures and staples for use in adult patients in open surgical repair of large vessels. We distribute BioGlue under Conformité Européene Mark product certification (CE Mark) in the European Economic Area (EEA) for repair of soft tissues (which include cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, and additional soft tissues). We also distribute BioGlue in Japan where it is approved for adhesion and support of hemostasis for aortotomy closure sites, suture/anastomosis sites (including aortic dissection and anastomosis sites with use of a prosthetic graft), and suture sites on the heart. Additional marketing approvals have been granted for specified applications in several other countries throughout the world. 
 BioGlue competes primarily with sealants from Baxter International, Inc, (Baxter), Ethicon, Inc. (a Johnson & Johnson Company), Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, and Bard (Bard), a subsidiary of Becton, Dickinson, and Company (BD). BioGlue competes with these products based on its features and benefits, such as strength and ease of use. 
 We distribute BioGlue throughout the U.S. and in approximately 85 other countries. Revenues from BioGlue accounted for 25%, 35%, and 35% of our total revenues in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

Heart Valves and Cardiac Patches for Cardiac Reconstruction 
 Patients with heart disease can experience valve insufficiency, regurgitation, or stenosis that may require heart valve repair or replacement surgery. Patients with congenital cardiac defects such as Tetralogy of Fallot, Truncus Arteriosus, and Pulmonary Atresia can require complex cardiac reconstructive surgery to repair the defect. Cardiac surgery can include the implantation of mechanical heart valves, bioprosthetic (animal-derived or xenograft) heart valves and tissues, synthetic tissues, or donated human tissues. 
 Mechanical heart valves are durable and are often a solution that will last for the remainder of a patients life without replacement. Mechanical valves are readily available and are a relatively inexpensive solution for those requiring a valve replacement. These valves contain a synthetic sewing ring to facilitate implantation. Patients who receive mechanical heart valves are required to undergo long-term blood thinning or anticoagulation drug therapy to minimize the risk of complications from blood clots. 
 Bioprosthetic tissues include bovine, equine, or porcine tissue valves, and surgical patches. Bioprosthetic valves are readily available and are a relatively inexpensive solution for those requiring a valve replacement. Bioprosthetic heart valves usually have a life of 7 to 20 years, after which a degenerating valve must be replaced. Multiple replacements, each requiring open heart surgery, can be a significant concern for younger patient populations. Bioprosthetic tissues are typically processed with glutaraldehyde, which may result in progressive calcification, or hardening of the tissue over time. These valves often contain a synthetic sewing ring to facilitate implantation. Patients receiving a bioprosthetic heart valve may not require long-term anticoagulation drug therapy, although some of these patients may require anticoagulation drug therapy for other heart or vascular conditions. 
 Synthetic surgical patches are available for use in cardiac repair and synthetic materials are used in sewing rings for mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valves. These synthetic sewing rings may harbor bacteria and lead to an infection (endocarditis), which can be difficult to treat with antibiotics. Patients with an infected mechanical or bioprosthetic valve may require valve replacement surgery. 
 Human heart valves are available for use in valve replacement procedures. Human heart valves allow for more normal blood flow and often provide higher cardiac output than mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valves. Human tissue responds better to treatment for infections, such as endocarditis, and is not as susceptible to progressive calcification as glutaraldehyde-fixed bioprosthetic tissues. Human heart valves do not require anticoagulation drug therapy. Human tissue patches are also available for use in a variety of cardiac repair procedures. Human vascular tissues are used in cardiac and vascular bypass surgery. The transplant of any human tissue that has not been preserved, however, must be accomplished within extremely short time limits. Cryopreservation, or cooling and storing at extremely cold temperatures, expands the treatment options available by extending these timelines. 
 The 2013 Society of Thoracic Surgeons Guidelines, (the Guidelines) as published in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery, have increased the indication (from Class II to Class I) and broadened the scope for using a human heart valve during aortic valve replacement surgery due to endocarditis. The Class I indication means that an aortic homograft is the recommended course of treatment when endocarditis has functionally destroyed the aortic valve annulus. The previous Class II indication meant that it was merely an acceptable course of treatment. Consequently, for many physicians, human heart valves are the preferred alternative to animal-derived and mechanical valves for patients who have, or are at risk to contract, endocarditis. 
 We currently market the On-X aortic and mitral mechanical heart valves for valve replacement procedures. We also market our cardiac preservation services, including our CryoValve and CryoValve SG human tissues, for heart valve replacement surgeries and our CryoPatch and CryoPatch SG human tissues for cardiac repair procedures. Our PhotoFix product is a bovine patch device used for cardiac and vascular repair. 
 On-X Mechanical Heart Valves 
 The On-X catalogue of products includes the On-X prosthetic aortic and mitral heart valve and the On-X ascending aortic prosthesis (AAP). We also distribute CarbonAid CO2 diffusion catheters and Chord-X ePTFE sutures for mitral chordal replacement, and we offer pyrolytic carbon coating services to other medical device manufacturers as part of the On-X family of products. 
 The On-X heart valve is a bileaflet mechanical valve composed of a graphite substrate coated with On-Xs pyrolytic carbon coating. The On-X heart valve is available for both aortic and mitral indications and with a variety of sewing ring 
 
7 
 
 options to suit physicians preferences. The On-X AAP is an On-X aortic valve combined with a synthetic vascular graft to allow physicians to more conveniently treat patients requiring both an aortic valve replacement and an aortic graft. 
 As discussed above, all mechanical valve patients require anticoagulation drug therapy with warfarin, which creates a risk of harmful bleeding. The On-X aortic heart valve is the only mechanical valve FDA approved to be marketed as, and clinically proven to be, safer for use by the patient with less anticoagulation. In a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing reduced warfarin to standard warfarin dose in On-X aortic heart valve patients, the reduced warfarin dose group had 60% fewer bleeding events without an increase in stroke risk. 
 The On-X heart valve is FDA approved for the replacement of diseased, damaged, or malfunctioning native or prosthetic heart valves in the aortic and mitral positions and is classified as a Class III medical device. On-X distributes the On-X heart valve under CE Mark in the EEA. Additional marketing approvals have been granted in several other countries throughout the world. 
 The On-X heart valves compete primarily with mechanical valves from Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic, Inc., and LivaNova PLC (LivaNova) based on the On-X heart valves features and benefits, such as full 90-degree leaflet opening, pure pyrolytic carbon, flared inlet, and approved labeling claim for lower warfarin requirements for aortic valves. 
 We began distributing On-X heart valves in January 2016. We distribute On-X heart valves throughout the U.S. and in approximately 90 other countries. Revenues from On-X products accounted for 17%, 19%, and 19% of total revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
 Cardiac Preservation Services 
 Our proprietary preservation process involves dissection, processing, preservation, and storage of donated human tissues by us until they are shipped to an implanting physician. The cardiac tissues currently preserved by us include aortic and pulmonary heart valves and cardiac patches in three primary anatomic configurations: pulmonary hemi-artery, pulmonary trunk, and pulmonary branch. Each of these tissues maintains a structure which more closely resembles and simulates the performance of the patients own tissue compared to non-human tissue alternatives. Our cardiac tissues are used in a variety of valve replacement and cardiac reconstruction surgeries. We believe the human tissues we distribute offer specific advantages over mechanical, synthetic, and bioprosthetic alternatives. Depending on the alternative, the advantages of our heart valves include more natural blood flow properties, the ability to use the valve with patients who have endocarditis, the elimination of a need for long-term drug therapy to prevent excessive blood clotting, and a reduced risk of catastrophic failure, thromboembolism (stroke), or calcification. 
 Our cardiac tissues include the CryoValve SGPV and the CryoPatch SG, both processed with our proprietary SynerGraft decellularization technology. A multi-center study showed that at 10 years, patients with our proprietary SynerGraft valves had a 17% re-operation rate, as compared to a 40% re-operation rate for patients with non-SynerGraft valves. We use the SynerGraft technology in pulmonary valve and pulmonary cardiac patch tissue processing. 
 We believe that at least one domestic tissue bank, LifeNet Health, Inc. (LifeNet), offers preserved human heart valves and patches in competition with us. Alternatives to human heart valves processed by us include valve repair and valve replacement with bioprosthetic valves or mechanical valves. We compete with bioprosthetic or mechanical valves from companies including Medtronic, Inc., Edwards Life Sciences, Inc., LivaNova, and Abbott Laboratories. Alternatives to our human cardiac patches include xenograft small intestine submucosa (SIS) and glutaraldehyde fixed bovine pericardial patches. We compete with xenograft products from companies including Aziyo Biologics, Edwards Life Sciences, Inc., Admedus, Inc. (Admedus), Abbott Laboratories, and Baxter. 
 We believe that the human heart valves preserved by us compare favorably with bioprosthetic and mechanical valves, for certain indications and patient populations, and that the human cardiac patches preserved by us compare favorably with xenograft SIS and glutaraldehyde fixed bovine pericardial patches, due to the benefits of human tissue discussed above. Human tissue is the preferred replacement alternative with respect to certain medical conditions, such as pediatric cardiac reconstruction, congenital cardiac defect repair, valve replacements for women in their child-bearing years, and valve replacements for patients with endocarditis. In addition, implantation of SynerGraft treated cardiac tissue reduces the risk for induction of Class I and Class II alloantibodies, based on Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA) measured at up to one year, compared to standard processed cardiac tissues. We believe that this reduced risk may provide a competitive advantage for CryoValve SGPV and CryoPatch SG for patients who later need a whole organ transplant, because an increased PRA can decrease the number of possible donors for subsequent organ transplants and increase time on transplant waiting lists.

We believe that we compete favorably with other entities that preserve human tissue on the basis of surgeon preference, documented clinical data, technology, and customer service, particularly with respect to the capabilities of our field representatives. 
 We distribute human cardiac tissues to implanting institutions throughout the U.S. Our CryoValve SGPV and CryoPatch SG are distributed under 510(k) clearance from the FDA. We also distribute tissues in Canada. Revenues from cardiac tissue preservation services accounted for 14%, 17%, and 17% of total revenues in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
 PhotoFix 
 PhotoFix is a bovine pericardial patch stabilized using a dye-mediated photo-fixation process that requires no glutaraldehyde. PhotoFix has FDA 510(k) clearance and is indicated for use in intracardiac repair, great vessel repair, suture line buttressing, pericardial closure, and vascular repair and reconstruction (for example: the carotid, iliac, femoral, and tibial blood vessels and arteriovenous access revisions). 
 Our PhotoFix product line competes with bioprosthetic and synthetic cardiac patch offerings from several other companies, including Baxter, Admedus, Aziyo Biologics, and Abbott Laboratories based on PhotoFixs features and benefits, such as the photo-oxidation cross-linking process that does not use glutaraldehyde. 
 In 2014 we entered into an exclusive supply and distribution agreement with Genesee Biomedical, Inc. (GBI) to acquire the distribution rights to PhotoFix. In April 2016 we exercised our right to acquire the PhotoFix technology from GBI and began shipping product manufactured at our headquarters facility in 2018. Revenues from PhotoFix accounted for approximately 1% of our total revenues in each of 2018, 2017, and 2016. 
 Hybrid Stent Grafts for Aortic Arch and Thoracic Aortic Repair 
 Hybrid stent graft systems, surgical grafts, and endovascular stent grafts can be used in the treatment of complex aortic arch and thoracic aortic disease, such as aortic dissection and thoracic aortic aneurysms. 
 Aortic dissection occurs when the innermost layer of the aorta tears and blood surges through the tear. Younger patients with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan Syndrome, and patients with bicuspid aortic valves (two leaflets on the valve instead of three) are more likely to develop aortic dissection. Left untreated, aortic dissection often results in a ruptured aorta, leading to death. 
 Many patients with an aortic dissection in the aortic arch also have an aneurysm or an aortic dissection in the descending thoracic aorta. An aortic aneurysm results from a weakening in the wall of an aorta, which causes it to balloon or expand in size. Risk factors for a patient to develop an aortic aneurysm include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and being male. When the aneurysm gets too large, the wall of the aorta can split or tear, resulting in a ruptured aorta or an aortic dissection. Left untreated, aortic aneurysms can result in death. 
 Often, the dissection in the aortic arch and the condition in the descending thoracic aorta are repaired in a two-stage procedure, one open surgical procedure to repair the arch followed by another procedure to repair the descending thoracic aorta. We market the E-vita OPEN PLUS to treat these conditions impacting the aortic arch and thoracic aorta. 
 E-vita OPEN PLUS 
 E-vita OPEN PLUS is a hybrid stent graft system used in the treatment of patients with either an aneurysm or dissection in the aortic arch and in the descending thoracic aorta. The E-vita OPEN PLUS stent graft system enables a one-stage treatment to repair this condition through a combined surgical and endovascular treatment, providing a more cost-effective solution for the healthcare system and allowing the patient to avoid an additional operation. 
 We distribute the E-vita OPEN PLUS under CE Mark in the EEA. Additional marketing approvals have been granted in other countries throughout the world. With this product, we compete with Terumo Corp. and two smaller competitors outside of the U.S., and, to our knowledge, there are no competitive products currently being commercialized in the U.S. The E-vita OPEN PLUS competes primarily on its proven stent graft technology and long-term clinical data.

Through our acquisition of JOTEC, we began distributing the E-vita OPEN PLUS in many markets outside of the United States in December 2017. Revenues from the E-vita OPEN PLUS accounted for 3% in 2018 and less than 1% of total revenues in 2017. 
 Endovascular and Open Vascular Surgery Markets 
 Aortic Aneurysm Repair 
 The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart through the aortic valve to the rest of the body. It extends upwards from the heart through the aortic arch and then down through the chest and into the abdomen, where it divides into larger arteries that supply each leg. The aorta is comprised of five segments: ascending, arch, thoracic, thoraco-abdominal, and abdominal. In some patients, part of the aorta can become abnormally large or bulge and this is referred to as an aneurysm. 
 An aneurysm results from a weakening in the wall of an aorta, which causes it to balloon or expand in size. Although an aneurysm can develop anywhere along the aorta, most occur in the section running through the abdomen (abdominal aortic aneurysms or AAA). Others occur in the section that runs through the chest (thoracic aortic aneurysms or TAA) or the area between the chest and the abdomen (thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms or TAAA). The precise cause of aortic aneurysms is uncertain, but risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and being male. When the aneurysm gets too large, the wall of the blood vessel can split or tear resulting in a ruptured aorta or an aortic dissection. Left untreated, aortic aneurysms can result in death. 
 There are two types of aortic aneurysm repair: open surgical repair or endovascular repair. Open surgical repair results in reasonable long-term survival but can be risky  especially in older patients and those with other serious medical conditions. During open surgical repair, a vascular graft is implanted in the aorta above and below the aneurysm. Blood will then flow through the graft. This surgery reinforces the diseased aorta and reduces the chance of vessel rupture. 
 Endovascular repair is minimally invasive, during which a stent graft is delivered transdermally to the area in the aorta needing repair. The stent graft expands inside the aorta and becomes the new channel for blood flow. The stent graft shields the aneurysm and helps prevent more pressure from building on it, thus preventing it from rupturing. 
 Through our acquisition of JOTEC, we began marketing a broad portfolio of endovascular products for aortic repair. These include highly differentiated products, such as the E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING, a portfolio of stent grafts tailor-made for a patients anatomy for TAAA repair, the E-liac for repair of aneurysms in the iliac arteries, and less differentiated products, including the E-vita THORACIC 3G for TAA repair and the E-tegra for AAA repair. 
 E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING 
 E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING is a comprehensive range of stent graft systems for the treatment of aortic vascular diseases that enables surgeons to quickly and efficiently respond to individual patient therapeutic requirements. The E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING is tailor-made for individual patients. There are currently only limited off-the-shelf product offerings to treat aneurysms in the thoraco-abdominal aorta due to the many side branches in this anatomy where blood flow to vital organs would be obstructed by unbranched stent grafts. JOTEC has pioneered a service whereby it manufactures a customized thoraco-abdominal stent graft within 3 weeks. E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING products are often used in conjunction with E-vita THORACIC 3G as well as the AAA offering, the E-tegra, or in combination with both. 
 We distribute the E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING products in the EEA and in a limited number of other countries around the world. E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING products compete with customized product offerings from Cook Medical and Terumo Corp. 
 Through our acquisition of JOTEC, we began distributing the E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING portfolio in many markets outside the United States in December 2017. Revenues from E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING accounted for 5% in 2018 and less than 1% of total revenues in 2017. 
 E-ventus BX 
 E-ventus BX is a balloon-expandable peripheral stent graft indicated for the endovascular treatment of renal and pelvic arteries in cases of ruptures, dissections, and aneurysms. The E-ventus BX stent graft has high flexibility together with high radial strength through the combination of the microporous single-layer ePTFE cover and the cobalt chromium stent. The E-
 
10 
 
 ventus BX stent graft features minimal recoil and foreshortening and enables secure fixation and positioning in the vessel. The E-ventus BX delivery system has a highly flexible catheter which allows easy advancement in the vessel and enables lesions to be reliably reached by the catheter. Radiopaque markers on the delivery system enable secure and accurate positioning of the stent graft. The E-ventus BX is often used in conjunction with E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING products as well as the E-liac stent graft. 
 We distribute the E-ventus BX under CE Mark in the EEA and under additional marketing approvals in several other countries throughout the world. The E-ventus BX competes with products from Maquet, Inc., Gore & Associates (Gore), and BD. 
 Through our acquisition of JOTEC, we began distributing the E-ventus BX in many markets outside of the United States in December 2017. Revenues from the E-ventus BX accounted for 3% in 2018 and less than 1% of total revenues in 2017. 
 E-liac
The E-liac is a stent graft used to treat aneurysmal iliac arteries as well as aneurysmal iliac side branches. The E-liac is a self-expanding stent graft characterized by easy and safe handling, which makes it possible to safely reach the lesion and accurately position the stent graft in the vessel. We estimate that 20% of patients who have an AAA also have an aneurysmal iliac artery, and as such, the E-liac is often used in conjunction with the E-tegra AAA device as well as one or two E-ventus BX devices. 
 We distribute the E-liac under CE Mark in the EEA. Additional marketing approvals have been granted in several other countries throughout the world. The E-liac competes with products from Gore and Cook Medical. 
 Through our acquisition of JOTEC, we began distributing the E-liac in many markets outside of the United States in December 2017. Revenues from the E-liac accounted for 2% in 2018 and less than 1% of total revenues in 2017. 
 E-vita THORACIC 3G 
 The E-vita THORACIC 3G is a stent graft system that enables endovascular treatment of TAAs. Its unique spring configuration gives the stent graft flexibility, helping the implant adapt to the vessels shape and ensuring a good seal at the landing zone, even in the case of complex vascular anatomy. Compared to its competing products, its different proximal and distal stent graft configurations, as well as straight and conical designs, enable individual treatment of the diseased aorta. The product line includes a wide portfolio of tapered versions from proximal to distal. The wide variety ensures the possibility of adapting the stent graft to the native course of the descending aorta. The E-vita THORACIC 3G is sometimes used in conjunction with the E-vita OPEN PLUS as well as E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING. 
 We distribute the E-vita THORACIC 3G under CE Mark in the EEA. Additional marketing approvals have been granted in several other countries throughout the world. The E-vita THORACIC 3G competes with products from Medtronic, Inc., Gore, Terumo Corp., and Cook Medical. 
 Through our acquisition of JOTEC, we began distributing the E-vita THORACIC 3G in many markets outside of the United States in December 2017. Revenues from the E-vita THORACIC 3G accounted for 2% in 2018 and less than 1% of total revenues in 2017. 
 E-tegra
The E-tegra is an AAA stent graft system with special stent design for secure sealing that makes difficult vascular anatomies treatable, thus expanding endovascular treatment options for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms. The design of the E-tegra enables optimal fixation and sealing. It is a proximal laser cut stent with anchors for suprarenal stent graft fixation. Its asymmetric stent design and seamless cover ensure excellent adaptation to the vessel. The product also features a low-profile delivery system with its unique squeeze-to-release mechanism supporting the user by ensuring excellent control during each phase of the implantation. The E-tegra is often used in combination with E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING developed products and the E-liac.
We distribute the E-tegra under CE Mark in the EEA. Additional marketing approvals have been granted in several other countries throughout the world. The E-tegra competes with products from several companies, including Medtronic, Inc., Gore, Terumo Corp., Endologix, Antegraft, Inc., and Cook Medical.

Through our acquisition of JOTEC, we began distributing the E-tegra in many markets outside of the United States in December 2017. Revenues from the E-tegra accounted for 5% in 2018 and less than 1% of total revenues in 2017. 
 Peripheral Vascular Disease 
 Patients with peripheral vascular disease can experience reduced blood flow, usually in the arms and legs. This can result in poor circulation, pain, and sores that do not heal. Failure to achieve revascularization of an obstructed vessel may result in the loss of a limb or even death of the patient. When patients require peripheral bypass surgery, the surgeons first choice generally is a graft of the patients own tissue (an autograft). In cases of advanced vascular disease, however, patients may not have suitable vascular tissue for transplantation. Other artery and vascular repair procedures include infected abdominal aortic grafts, insufficient vascular access, carotid endarterectomy, or vessel repair. These procedures may include the use of bioprosthetic patches, synthetic grafts or patches, or donated human vascular tissues. Alternative treatments may include the repair, partial removal, or complete removal of the damaged tissue. 
 Bioprosthetic vascular grafts and patches, including those made of bovine or porcine tissue can be used for a variety of vascular repair procedures. Bioprosthetic grafts are readily available and are a relatively inexpensive solution for those requiring a vascular repair procedure. Bioprosthetic tissues are typically processed with glutaraldehyde, which may result in progressive calcification. 
 Synthetic vascular grafts and patches can be used for a variety of vascular repair procedures. Synthetic grafts are readily available and are a relatively inexpensive solution for those requiring a vascular repair procedure. However, synthetic grafts and patches are generally not suitable for use in infected areas because they may harbor bacteria and are difficult to treat with antibiotics. Synthetic vascular grafts have a tendency to obstruct over time, particularly in below-the-knee surgeries. 
 Human vascular tissues tend to respond better to treatment for infection and remain open and accessible for longer periods of time and, as such, are used in indications where synthetic grafts typically fail, such as in infected areas and for below-the-knee surgeries. Human vascular and arterial tissues are also used in a variety of other reconstruction procedures such as cardiac bypass surgery and as vascular access grafts for hemodialysis. The transplant of human tissue that has not been preserved must be accomplished within extremely short time limits. Cryopreservation expands the treatment options available by extending these timelines. 
 We market our vascular preservation services, including our CryoVein® and CryoArtery® tissues, and a synthetic surgical graft portfolio, acquired through our acquisition of JOTEC, for peripheral vascular reconstruction surgeries. 
 Vascular Preservation Services 
 Our proprietary preservation process involves dissection, processing, preservation, and storage of tissues by us, until they are shipped to an implanting physician. The vascular tissues currently preserved by us include saphenous veins, aortoilliac arteries, and femoral veins and arteries. Each of these tissues maintains a structure, which more closely resembles and simulates the performance of the patients own tissue compared to non-human tissue alternatives. Our vascular tissues are used to treat a variety of vascular reconstructions, such as peripheral bypass, hemodialysis access, and aortic infections, which have saved the lives and limbs of patients. We believe the human tissues we distribute offer specific advantages over synthetic and bioprosthesis alternatives. 
 We believe that only two other domestic tissue banks, LifeNet, and LeMaitre Vascular, Inc. (LeMaitre), offer vascular tissue in competition with us. There are also a number of providers of synthetic and bioprosthetic alternatives to vascular tissues preserved by us and those alternatives are available primarily in medium and large diameters. Our vascular tissues compete with products from Gore, BD, Artegraft, Inc., LeMaitre, and Maquet, Inc. 
 We believe that we compete favorably with other entities that preserve human vascular tissues on the basis of surgeon preference, documented clinical data, technology, and customer service, particularly with respect to the capabilities of our field representatives. 
 We distribute human vascular tissues to implanting institutions throughout the U.S. We also distribute vascular tissues in Canada and have limited distribution through a special access program in Germany. Revenues from vascular preservation services accounted for 15%, 20%, and 20% of our revenues in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

Synthetic vascular grafts 
 In addition to our endovascular stent graft offerings, we have a broad line of synthetic vascular grafts that are used in open aortic and peripheral vascular surgical procedures. Our offerings include ePTFE grafts and both woven and knitted polyester grafts. Not only are we able to manufacture and sell a broad line of synthetic vascular graft offerings, but our expertise in synthetic graft manufacturing complements our ability to manufacture our own nitinol stents, both of which are used in our stent graft systems. 
 We distribute our synthetic surgical vascular grafts under CE Mark in the EEA. Additional marketing approvals have been granted in several other countries throughout the world. Our synthetic grafts compete with products from BD, Gore, LeMaitre, Vascutek, and Maquet, Inc. 
 Through our acquisition of JOTEC, we began distributing synthetic surgical vascular grafts in many markets outside of the United States in December 2017. Revenues from synthetic surgical vascular grafts accounted for 2% in 2018 and less than 1% of total revenues in 2017. 
 Other Technologies 
 Angina Treatment 
 Angina consists of pressure, discomfort, or pain in the chest typically due to narrowed or blocked arteries, which may result in ischemic heart disease. Patients with severe angina are often treated with surgical procedures including angioplasty or coronary artery bypass or with medications such as aspirin, nitrates, beta-blockers, statins, or calcium channel blockers. Pain may be chronic or may become pronounced with exercise. Angina can also be treated with Transmyocardial Revascularization (TMR), a procedure that can be performed as an open surgical procedure or through a minimally invasive surgery either as a stand-alone procedure or concurrently with coronary artery bypass. During TMR, the surgeon uses a disposable handpiece to deliver precise bursts of laser energy directly to an area of heart muscle that is suffering from ischemic heart disease through a small incision or small ports with the patient under general anesthesia and without stopping the heart. TMR is typically performed with a CO2 or Holmium: YAG laser. It takes approximately 6 to 10 pulses of the laser to traverse the myocardium and create channels of one millimeter in diameter. During a typical procedure, approximately 20 to 40 channels are made in the heart muscle. The external openings seal with little blood loss. Angina usually subsides with improved oxygen supply to the targeted areas of the damaged heart muscle. We currently sell the CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line to perform TMR. 
CardioGenesis Cardiac Laser Therapy 
 Our CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line consists of Holmium: YAG laser consoles, related service and maintenance, and single-use, fiber-optic handpieces, which are used in TMR to treat patients with severe angina resulting from diffuse coronary artery disease. Patients undergoing TMR treatment with CardioGenesis products have been shown to have angina reduction, longer event-free survival, reduction in cardiac related hospitalizations, and increased exercise tolerance. Our SolarGen 2100s Console (Console) uses the solid-state technology of the Holmium: YAG laser system to provide a stable and reliable energy platform that is designed to deliver precise energy output. The Console has an advanced electronic and cooling system technology, which allows for a smaller and lighter system, while providing 115V power capability. We also provide service plan options to ensure that the console is operating within the critical factory specifications. We distribute the SoloGrip® III disposable handpieces, which consist of multiple, fine fiber-optic strands in a one-millimeter diameter bundle and are designed to work with the console. The SoloGrip III handpiece has an ergonomic design and is pre-calibrated in the factory to provide easy and convenient access for treating all regions of the left ventricle. 
 The CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line is FDA approved for treating patients with severe angina that are not responsive to conventional therapy. We began distributing the CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line, primarily in the U.S., in May 2011 when we completed the acquisition of Cardiogenesis Corporation. Although the CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line has a CE Mark allowing commercial distribution into the EEA, we do not actively market the product line internationally. 
 Our CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy competes with other methods for the treatment of coronary artery disease, including drug therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass surgery, and enhanced external counter pulsation. Currently, the only directly competitive laser technology for the performance of TMR is the CO2 Heart Laser 
 
13 
 
 System manufactured by Novadaq Technologies, Inc. Our revascularization technology competes on the basis of its ease of use, versatility, size of laser console, and improved access to the treatment area with a smaller fiber-optic system. 
 We distribute handpieces and CardioGenesis laser consoles primarily in the U.S. Revenues from CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy accounted for 2%, 4%, and 5% of our total revenues in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
 Hemostats 
 Hemostatic agents are frequently utilized as an adjunct to sutures and staples to control intraoperative bleeding. Hemostatic agents prevent excess blood loss and can help maintain good visibility of the operative site. These products may reduce operating room time and decrease the number of blood transfusions required in surgical procedures. Hemostatic agents are available in various forms including pads, sponges, liquids, and powders. We currently market the powdered hemostatic agent PerClot. 
 PerClot 
 PerClot is an absorbable powdered hemostat, consisting of plant starch modified into ultra-hydrophilic, adhesive-forming hemostatic polymers. PerClot granules are biocompatible, absorbable polysaccharides containing no animal or human components. PerClot granules have a molecular structure that rapidly absorbs water, forming a gelled adhesive matrix that provides a mechanical barrier to any further bleeding and results in the accumulation of platelets, red blood cells, and coagulation proteins (thrombin, fibrinogen, etc.) at the site of application. PerClot does not require additional operating room preparation or special storage conditions and is easy to apply. PerClot is readily dissolved by saline irrigation and is totally absorbed by the body within several days. In September 2010, we entered into a distribution agreement and a license and manufacturing agreement with Starch Medical, Inc. (SMI), which allows us to distribute PerClot worldwide, except in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, North Korea, Iran, and Syria. 
 PerClot has a CE Mark allowing commercial distribution in the EEA and other markets. PerClot is indicated for use in surgical procedures, including cardiac, vascular, orthopaedic, neurological, gynecological, ENT, and trauma surgery as an adjunct hemostat when control of bleeding from capillary, venular, or arteriolar vessels by pressure, ligature, and other conventional means is either ineffective or impractical. 
 PerClot competes with various hemostats including thrombin products from Pfizer, Inc., Baxter, and Ethicon, Inc., and surgical hemostats from Pfizer, Inc., BD, Baxter, Ethicon, Inc., and BioCer Entwicklungs-GmbH. Other competitive products may include argon beam coagulators, which provide an electrical source of hemostasis. A number of companies have surgical hemostat products under development. PerClot competes on the basis of safety, clinical efficacy, absorption rates, and ease of use. 
 In January 2019 we completed enrolling patients in a clinical trial for the purpose of obtaining FDA Premarket Approval (PMA) to sell PerClot in the U.S., as discussed further in Research and Development and Clinical Research below. We anticipate PMA submission to the FDA in early 2020. We distribute PerClot in approximately 70 countries. Revenues from PerClot accounted for 2% of our total revenues in each of the years 2018, 2017, and 2016. 
 Vascular Access 
 End-stage renal disease (ESRD) refers to the stage of renal disease when the kidneys do not work well enough for the patient to live without dialysis or transplant. Patients with ESRD often undergo hemodialysis through an access site. We market our CryoVein femoral vein and CryoArtery femoral artery vascular preservation services for vascular access and previously marketed the Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow Graft (HeRO® Graft) and ProCol® Vascular Bioprosthesis (ProCol) for vascular access. 
 HeRO Graft and ProCol 
 We began distributing the HeRO Graft in the U.S. in May 2012 when we acquired Hemosphere, Inc. and distributed the product until we divested the product line in February 2016. Revenues from the HeRO Graft accounted for 1% of our total revenues in 2016. There were no HeRO Graft revenues in 2018 or 2017. 
 We began distributing ProCol in the U.S. in March 2014 under a distribution agreement with Hancock Jaffe and distributed the product until we divested the product line in March 2016. Revenues from ProCol accounted for less than 1% of our total revenues in 2016. There were no ProCol revenues in 2018 or 2017. 
 
14 
 
Marketing and Distribution 
 In the U.S and Canada, we market our products and preservation services primarily to physicians and distribute our products through our approximately 60-person direct sales team to hospitals and other healthcare facilities. We also have a team of region managers, national accounts manager, and sales and marketing management. Through our field representatives, we conduct field training for surgeons regarding the surgical applications of our products and tissues. 
 Our physician relations and education staff, clinical research staff, and field representatives assist physicians by providing educational materials, seminars, and clinics on methods for using our products and implanting tissue preserved by us. We sponsor programs where surgeons train other surgeons in best-demonstrated techniques. In addition, we host several workshops throughout the year that provide didactic and hands-on training to surgeons. We also produce educational videos for physicians and coordinate peer-to-peer training at various medical institutions. We believe that these activities enhance the medical communitys understanding of the clinical benefits of the products and tissues offered by us and help to differentiate us from other medical device companies and tissue processors. 
 Our human tissues are obtained through organ and tissue procurement organizations (OTPOs). To assist OTPOs, we provide educational materials and training on procurement, dissection, packaging, and shipping techniques. We produce educational videos and coordinate laboratory sessions for OTPO personnel to improve their recovery techniques and increase the yield of usable tissue. We also maintain staff 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, for OTPO support. 
 We market our products in the EEA, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region through JOTEC, based in Hechingen, Germany, as well as in several other subsidiaries based throughout Europe. We employ approximately 95 direct field service representatives and distributor managers in Germany, the U.K., France, Spain, Italy, Poland, Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium, and Ireland in the EMEA region. We provide customer service, logistics, marketing, and clinical support to cardiac, vascular, thoracic, and general surgeons throughout the EMEA region. 
 We market and distribute our products through our direct organization in certain parts of Brazil, and in other international markets through independent distributors in Asia Pacific and the Americas. Our Singapore subsidiary, Asia Pacific, provides sales and marketing support for the Asia Pacific region. 
 Suppliers, Sources, and Availability of Raw Materials and Tissues 
 We obtain a number of our raw materials and supplies from a small group of suppliers or a single- or sole-source supplier. Certain raw materials and components used in our products and tissue processing have stringent specifications. Supply interruptions or supplier quality, financial, or operational issues could cause us to have to temporarily reduce, temporarily halt, or permanently halt manufacturing, processing, or distribution activities. Ongoing efforts are in process to find alternative suppliers for single- or sole-source raw materials and supplies. The process of qualifying alternative suppliers could result in additional costs or lengthy delays or may not be possible. Any of these adverse outcomes could have a material, adverse effect on our revenues or profitability. Supplies of materials are discussed for each of our main products and services below. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 Our BioGlue product has three main product components: bovine protein, a cross linker, and a molded plastic resin delivery device. The bovine protein and cross linker are obtained from a small number of qualified suppliers. The delivery devices are manufactured by a single supplier, using resin supplied by a single supplier. We maintain a significant inventory of finished delivery devices to help mitigate the effects of a potential supply interruption. 
 We purchase grafts for our On-X AAP from a single supplier. We maintain an inventory of grafts to help mitigate the effects of a potential supply interruption. We also purchase various components for our On-X valves from single suppliers. We maintain inventories of these components to help mitigate the effects of a potential supply interruption. 
 We purchase laser consoles and handpieces for our CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line each from a separate single-source contract manufacturer. Using a secondary supplier for the laser consoles may be difficult because of the current manufacturers patent rights. In addition, these two manufacturers obtain certain laser and fiber-optic components and subassemblies from single sources. Our business is subject to interruption if either of these contract manufacturers or their suppliers became unable or unwilling to do business with us. 
 We purchase PerClot for distribution from SMI pursuant to a distribution agreement. We maintain an extra supply of inventory of PerClot purchased from SMI and place orders for additional product in anticipation of higher sales to ensure a 
 
15 
 
 continuous supply. Our business may be subject to interruption if SMI were unable or became unwilling to supply PerClot to us for a sustained period of time. 
 Our preservation services business and our ability to supply needed tissues is dependent upon donation of tissues from human donors by donor families. Donated human tissue is procured from deceased human donors by OTPOs. We must rely on the OTPOs that we work with to educate the public on the need for donation, to foster a willingness to donate tissue, to follow our donor screening and procurement procedures, and to send donated tissue to us. We have active relationships with approximately 55 OTPOs throughout the U.S. We believe these relationships are critical in the preservation services industry and that the breadth of these existing relationships provides us with a significant advantage over potential new entrants to this market. 
 We also use various raw materials, including medicines and solutions, in our tissue processing. Some of these raw materials are manufactured by single suppliers or by a small group of suppliers. All of these factors subject us to risk of supply interruption. 
 The endovascular stent graft systems consist of two main product components: the stent graft and the delivery system. 
 The stent graft is manufactured out of several different raw materials that are manufactured by JOTEC and various external suppliers, including single suppliers. The delivery systems are manufactured by JOTEC from several different raw materials with different processing techniques. Primary processes are assembling of injection molded parts and machine drilled parts, suturing of stent grafts, processing of Nitinol, and weaving of textiles. 
 The conventional polyester grafts consist of two main product components: polyester fabric and collagen coating. 
 The polyester fabric is manufactured by JOTEC internally out of a few different yarns that are supplied by an external supplier. The collagen suspension is manufactured by JOTEC out of a collagenous tissue that is supplied by an external supplier. 
 The conventional ePTFE grafts are manufactured by JOTEC out of various raw materials supplied by several suppliers. For some products the ePTFE grafts are heparin coated. For these products, the heparin suspension is manufactured by JOTEC out of a heparin solution that is also supplied by an external supplier. 
 Operations, Manufacturing, and Tissue Preservation 
 We maintain a facility, which contains our corporate headquarters and laboratory space, and an additional off-site warehouse in Kennesaw, Georgia. We manufacture BioGlue, BioFoam, and PhotoFix and process human tissues at our headquarters facility. Our headquarters also includes a CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy maintenance and evaluation laboratory space. 
 We maintain a facility of combined manufacturing and office space in Atlanta, Georgia, and additional office space in Kennesaw, Georgia, both of which we currently sublet to third-parties. Our Atlanta facility was sublet beginning in 2018. 
 Our On-X facility consists of combined manufacturing, warehouse, and office space in Austin, Texas, where our On-X products, including On-X heart valves and AAPs, are manufactured. 
 Our JOTEC facility consists of combined manufacturing, warehousing, and office space in Hechingen, Germany and is our EMEA headquarters. 
 We also maintain sales offices, some of which have distribution operations, in Brazil, the U.K., Italy, Poland, Singapore, Spain, and Switzerland. See also Part I, Item 2, Properties. 
 In all of our facilities, we are subject to regulatory standards for good manufacturing practices, including current Quality System Regulations, which are the FDA regulatory requirements for medical device manufacturers, and current Good Tissue Practices (cGTPs), which are the FDA regulatory requirements for the processing of human tissue. We also operate according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13485 Quality System Requirements, an internationally recognized voluntary system of quality management for companies that design, develop, manufacture, distribute, and service medical devices. We maintain a Certification of Approval to the ISO 13485. The Medical Device Directive (MDD) is the governing document for the EEA that details requirements for safety and risk. Effective May 26, 2020 the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) will replace MDD and will impose more stringent requirements on manufacturers and European Notified Bodies, who have already begun the transition to these new requirements. 
 
16 
 
We work with three Notified Bodies that are officially recognized by the European Union to perform assessments of compliance with ISO 13485 and the MDD. LNE/G-Med (G-Med) acts as our Notified Body for the On-X product line, Lloyds Register Quality Assurance Limited (LRQA) acts as our Notified Body for our BioGlue, BioFoam, and PhotoFix product line, and Deutscher Kraftfahrzeug-Überwachungs-Verein (DEKRA) acts as our Notified Body for our JOTEC product line. G-Med, LRQA, and DEKRA perform periodic on-site inspections to independently review our compliance with systems and regulatory requirements. G-Med, LRQA and DEKRA also perform assessments of compliance with the Canadian Medical Devices Conformity Assessment System (CMDCAS). 
 We employ a comprehensive quality assurance program in our product manufacturing and tissue preservation activities. Materials, solutions, and components utilized in our manufacturing and tissue processing are received and inspected by trained quality control personnel according to written specifications and standard operating procedures, and those items found to comply with our standards are utilized in our operations. Materials, components, subassemblies, and tissues are documented throughout manufacturing or processing to assure traceability. 
 We evaluate and inspect both our manufactured and distributed products to ensure conformity to product specifications. Processes are validated to produce products meeting our specifications. Each process is documented along with inspection results, including final finished product inspection and acceptance. Records are maintained as to the consignees of products to track product performance and to facilitate product removals or corrections, if necessary. 
 We maintain controls over our tissue processing to ensure conformity with our procedures. OTPOs must follow our policies related to tissue recovery practices and are subject to periodic audits to confirm compliance. Samples are taken from donated tissue for microbiological testing, and tissue must be shown to be free of certain detectable microbial contaminants before being released for distribution. Tissue processing records and donor information is reviewed to identify characteristics that would disqualify the tissue for processing or implantation. Once tissue is released for distribution, it is moved from quarantine to an implantable status. Tissue is stored by us until it is shipped to a hospital, where the tissue is thawed and implanted immediately or held in a liquid nitrogen freezer pending implantation. 
 Government Regulation 
 Medical devices and human tissues are subject to a number of regulations from various government bodies including in the U.S., federal, state, and local governments, as well as various international regulatory bodies. Government regulations are continually evolving, and requirements may change with or without notice. Changes in government regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing government regulations could have a material, adverse impact on us. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to government regulations. 
U.S. Federal Regulation of Medical Devices 
 The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) provides that, unless exempted by regulation, medical devices may not be distributed in the U.S. unless they have been approved or cleared for marketing by the FDA. Medical devices may receive clearance through either a 510(k) process or an approval through an investigational device exemption (IDE) and PMA process. 
 Under a Section 510(k) process, a medical device manufacturer provides premarket notification that it intends to begin marketing a product and shows that the product is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed predicate product. To be found substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the device must be for the same intended use and have either the same technological characteristics or different technological characteristics that do not raise new questions of safety or effectiveness. In some cases, the submission must include data from clinical studies in order to demonstrate substantial equivalency to a predicate device. Marketing may commence when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding such substantial equivalence. 
 FDA regulations require approval through the IDE/PMA process for all Class III medical devices and for medical devices not deemed substantially equivalent to a predicate device. An IDE authorizes distribution of devices that lack PMA or 510(k) clearance for clinical evaluation purposes. After a product is subjected to clinical testing under an IDE, we may file a PMA application. Once a PMA application has been submitted, the FDAs review may be lengthy and may include requests for additional data, which may require us to undertake additional human clinical studies. Marketing of the device may begin when the FDA has approved the PMA. 
 FDCA requires all medical device manufacturers and distributors to register with the FDA annually and to provide the FDA with a list of those medical devices they distribute commercially. FDCA also requires manufacturers of medical 
 
17 
 
 devices to comply with labeling requirements and to manufacture devices in accordance with Quality System Regulations, which require that companies manufacture their products and maintain their documents in compliance with good manufacturing practices, including: design, document production, process, labeling and packaging controls, process validation, and other applicable quality control activities. The FDAs medical device reporting regulation requires that a device manufacturer provide information to the FDA on death or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its products, as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. The FDA further requires that certain medical devices that may not be sold in the U.S. follow certain procedures before they are exported. The FDA periodically inspects our facilities to review our compliance with these and other regulations and has authority to seize non-complying medical devices, enjoin and/or impose civil penalties on manufacturers and distributors marketing non-complying medical devices, criminally prosecute violators, and order recalls in certain instances. 
 The following products are, or would, upon approval, be classified as Class III medical devices: BioGlue, BioFoam, On-X heart valve, On-X AAP, PerClot, CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy, E-vita OPEN PLUS, E-vita THORACIC 3G, E-xtra, E-tegra, and E-liac. CryoPatch SG is classified as Class II medical devices. We obtained 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market the CryoValve SGPV; however, these tissues are not officially classified as Class II or III medical devices. 
 In October 2014 the FDA convened an advisory committee meeting to consider the FDAs recommendation to reclassify more than minimally manipulated (MMM) allograft heart valves from an unclassified medical device to a Class III medical device. The class of MMM allograft heart valves includes our CryoValve SGPV. At the meeting, a majority of the advisory committee panel recommended to the FDA that MMM allograft heart valves be re-classified as a Class III product. If the FDA issues a proposal for reclassification of MMM allograft heart valves, it will be subject to a public comment period before finalization. After publication of the reclassification rule, we expect to have thirty months to submit for a PMA, after which the FDA will determine if, and for how long, we may continue to provide these tissues to customers. To date, the FDA has not issued a proposed reclassification for MMM allograft heart valves. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk FactorsRisks Relating To Our Business
Reclassification by the FDA of CryoValve SGPV may make it commercially infeasible to continue processing the CryoValve SGPV. 
 U.S. Federal Regulation of Human Tissue 
 The FDA regulates human tissues pursuant to Section 361 of the Public Health Services Act, which in turn provides the regulatory framework for regulation of human cellular and tissue products. The FDA regulations focus on donor screening and testing to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of HIV-1 and -2, Hepatitis B and C, and other communicable diseases and disease agents. The regulations set minimum requirements to prevent the transmission of communicable diseases from human tissue used for transplantation. The regulations define human tissue as any tissue derived from a human body which is (i) intended for administration to another human for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease and (ii) recovered, preserved, stored, or distributed by methods not intended to change tissue function or characteristics. The FDA definition excludes, among other things, tissue that currently is regulated as a human drug, biological product, or medical device, and it also excludes kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, or any other vascularized human organ. The current regulations applicable to human tissues include requirements for donor suitability, processing standards, establishment registration, product listing, testing, and screening for risks of communicable diseases. The FDA periodically audits our tissue preservation facilities for compliance with its requirements and has the authority to enjoin, force a recall, or require the destruction of tissues that do not meet its requirements. 
 NOTA Regulation 
 Our activities in preserving and transporting human hearts and certain other organs are also subject to federal regulation under the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), which makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce. NOTA excludes from the definition of valuable consideration reasonable payments associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, and storage of a human organ. The purpose of this statutory provision is to allow for compensation for legitimate services. We believe that, to the extent our activities are subject to NOTA, we meet this statutory provision relating to the reasonableness of our charges. 
 State Licensing Requirements 
 Some states have enacted statutes and regulations governing the manufacture, sale, or distribution of medical devices, and we believe we are in compliance with such applicable state laws and regulations. 
 
18 
 
Some states have enacted statutes and regulations governing the preservation, transportation, and storage of human organs and tissues. The activities we engage in require us to be either licensed or registered as a clinical laboratory or tissue bank under California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, New York, and Oregon law. We have such licenses or registrations, and we believe we are in compliance with applicable state laws and regulations relating to clinical laboratories and tissue banks that store, preserve, and distribute human tissue designed to be used for medical purposes in human beings. 
 Some of our employees have obtained other required state licenses. The regulatory bodies of states may perform inspections of our facilities as required to ensure compliance with state laws and regulations. 
 International Approval Requirements 
 Sales of medical devices and shipments of human tissues outside the U.S. are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of other countries must be obtained and compliance with applicable regulations for tissues must be met prior to commercial distribution of the products or human tissues in those countries. The time required to obtain these approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Countries in which we distribute products and tissue may perform inspections of our facilities to ensure compliance with local country regulations. 
 The EEA recognizes a single medical device approval, called a CE Mark, which allows for distribution of an approved product throughout the EEA without additional general applications in each country. Individual EEA members, however, reserve the right to require additional labeling or information to address particular patient safety issues prior to allowing marketing. Third-parties called Notified Bodies award the CE Mark. These Notified Bodies are approved and subject to review by the Competent Authorities of their respective countries. LRQA, G-Med and DEKRA perform periodic on-site inspections to independently review our compliance with systems and regulatory requirements. A number of countries outside of the EEA accept the CE Mark in lieu of marketing submissions as an addendum to that countrys application process. We have CE Marks for BioGlue, BioFoam, On-X heart valves, On-X Chord-X sutures, CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy consoles and handpieces, E-vita OPEN PLUS, E-vita THORACIC 3G, E-tegra, E-liac, and other devices. An application to approve a CE Mark for On-X AAP, which was temporarily suspended, is currently under review by our Notified Body. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk FactorsRisks Relating To Our Business
Our revenues for the On-X AAP in Europe may continue to be adversely affected by regulatory enforcement activities regarding the On-X AAPs CE Mark.    Additionally, E-ventus, which we distribute, has a CE Mark. 
 Backlog 
 As of December 31, 2018, we did not have a firm backlog of orders related to BioGlue, the JOTEC product line, On-X heart valves, CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy, PerClot, or PhotoFix. The limited supply of certain types or sizes of preserved tissue can result in a backlog of orders for these tissues. The amount of backlog fluctuates based on the tissues available for shipment and varies based on the surgical needs of specific cases. Our backlog of human tissue consists mostly of pediatric tissues that have limited availability. Our backlog is generally not considered firm and must be confirmed with the customer before shipment. 
Research and Development and Clinical Research 
 We use our technical and scientific expertise to identify market opportunities for new products or services, or to expand the use of our current products and services, through expanded indications or product or tissue enhancements. Our research and development strategy is to allocate most of our available resources among our core market areas based on the potential market size, estimated development time and cost, and the expected efficacy for any potential product or service offering. To the extent we identify new non-core products or additional applications for our core products, we may attempt to license these products to corporate partners for further development or seek funding from outside sources to continue commercial 
 
19 
 
 development. We may also attempt to acquire or license additional strategically complementary products or technologies from third-parties to supplement our product lines. 
 Research on these and other projects is conducted in our research and development laboratory or at universities or clinics where we sponsor research projects. We also conduct preclinical and clinical studies at universities, medical centers, hospitals, and other third-party locations under contract with us. Research is inherently risky, and any potential products or tissues under development ultimately may not be deemed safe or effective or worth commercializing for other reasons and, therefore, may not generate a return on investment for us. Our clinical research department also collects and maintains clinical data on the use and effectiveness of our products and services. We use this data to inform third-parties on the benefits of our products and services and to help direct our continuing improvement efforts. 
 In 2018, 2017, and 2016 we spent approximately $23.1 million, $19.5 million, and $13.4 million, respectively, on research and development activities on new and existing products. These amounts accounted for approximately 9%, 10%, and 7% of our revenues for each of 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
 We are in the process of developing or investigating several new products and technologies, as well as changes and enhancements to our existing products and services. Our strategies for driving growth include new product approvals or indications, global expansion, and business development. These activities will likely require additional research, new clinical studies, and/or compilation of clinical data. 
 We are currently seeking regulatory approval for BioGlue in China. We are working with the Chinese regulatory authorities and our consulting partners to conduct this ongoing study and complete the submission for market approval. Enrollment was completed in the third quarter of 2018. 
 We are currently conducting clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of an additional size of the On-X aortic heart valve. This study is ongoing, and enrollment is expected to continue throughout 2019. 
 We are currently conducting a clinical trial to assess reduced levels of required anticoagulation or warfarin for the On-X mitral heart valve. This study is ongoing, and enrollment is expected to continue throughout 2019. 
 At the FDAs request, we are conducting a post-approval study to collect long-term clinical data for the On-X aortic heart valve managed with reduced warfarin therapy. This study is ongoing and data collection is expected to continue throughout 2019. 
 We are conducting our pivotal clinical trial to gain approval to commercialize PerClot for surgical indications in the U.S. Enrollment was completed in January 2019. We anticipate PMA submission to the FDA in early 2020. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk FactorsRisks Relating To Our BusinessOur investment in PerClot is subject to significant risks, and our ability to fully realize our investment is dependent on our ability to obtain FDA approval and to successfully commercialize PerClot in the U.S. either directly or indirectly. 
 Patents, Licenses, and Other Proprietary Rights 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, confidentiality agreements, and security procedures to protect our proprietary products, preservation technology, trade secrets, and know-how. We believe that our patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and technology licensing rights provide us with important competitive advantages. We have also obtained additional rights through license and distribution agreements for additional products and technologies, including PerClot. We own or have licensed rights to 39 U.S. patents and 135 foreign patents for legacy CryoLife, JOTEC products, and On-X products, including patents that relate to our technology for BioGlue, JOTEC products, On-X heart valves, CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy, PerClot, cardiac and vascular tissue preservation, and decellularization of tissue. We have 32 pending U.S. patent applications and 69 pending foreign applications that relate to our legacy CryoLife products and services, On-X products, and JOTEC products. There can be no assurance that any patent applications pending will ultimately be issued as patents. 
 The remaining duration of our issued patents ranges from 1 year to 18 years. The main patent for BioGlue expired in mid-2012 in the U.S. and expired in mid-2013 in the majority of the rest of the world. Although the patent for BioGlue has expired, this technology is still protected by trade secrets and manufacturing know-how, as well as the time and expense to obtain regulatory approvals.

We have confidentiality agreements with our employees, our consultants, and third-party vendors to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the obligations of our employees, consultants, and third-parties, with whom we have entered into confidentiality agreements, will effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information or provide meaningful protection for our confidential information if there is unauthorized use or disclosure, or that our trade secrets or proprietary information will not be independently developed by our competitors. 
 See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to our patents, licenses, and other proprietary rights. 
 Seasonality 
 See Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSeasonality, regarding seasonality of our products and services. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018 we had approximately 1,100 employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage or interruption due to labor disputes. We believe our relations with our employees are good. 
Environmental Matters 
 Our tissue preservation activities generate some biomedical wastes, consisting primarily of human and animal pathological and biological wastes, including human and animal tissue and body fluids removed during laboratory procedures. The biomedical wastes generated by us are placed in appropriately constructed and labeled containers and are segregated from other wastes generated by us. We contract with third-parties for transport, treatment, and disposal of biomedical waste. Although we believe we are in compliance in with applicable laws and regulations the disposal of our waste regarding tissue preservation activities, as well as in our other production activities, the failure by us, or the companies with which we contract, to comply fully with any such regulations could result in an imposition of penalties, fines, or sanctions, which could materially, adversely affect our business. 
Risk Factors 
 Our business is subject to a number of risks. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors below for a discussion of these and other risk factors.
