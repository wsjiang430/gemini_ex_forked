 Item 1.  Business
 General
 We are a registered multibank financial holding company providing a diversified range of commercial and retail banking services in our main banking and branch facilities located in north, south, central and southeast Texas and the State of Oklahoma. We were organized and we operate as a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, (BHCA).  As a bank holding company, we may own one or more banks and may engage in activities closely related to banking.  In this regard, we are subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). In addition, all of our wholly-owned banking subsidiaries are members of and subject to regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  Our principal corporate offices are located in Laredo, Texas.
 Our principal assets at December 31, 2018, consisted of all the outstanding capital stock of four Texas state banking associations and one Oklahoma state banking corporation as follows:

· | International Bank of Commerce, located in Laredo, Texas (IBC);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | Commerce Bank, located in Laredo, Texas (Commerce Bank);
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | International Bank of Commerce, located in Brownsville, Texas (IBC Brownsville);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | International Bank of Commerce, located in Zapata, Texas (IBC Zapata); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | International Bank of Commerce, located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (IBC-Oklahoma).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      IBC-Oklahoma was formed as of January 1, 2017, as part of an internal corporate reorganization, whereby IBC assigned and transferred certain assets and liabilities located in Oklahoma and Dallas, Texas to IBC-Oklahoma.  These five subsidiary banks are collectively referred to in this report as our “Subsidiary Banks.”
 Our philosophy focuses on customer service as represented by the motto, “We Do More.” Our Subsidiary Banks maintain a strong commitment to their local communities by, among other things, appointing selected community members to local advisory boards (local boards). These local advisory boards help to direct the operations of the branches, under the supervision of the Subsidiary Bank’s board of directors.  These local boards also assist in developing or modifying our products and services to meet local customer needs, as well as introducing prospective customers to our many products and services. 
 We also own five direct non-banking subsidiaries:

· | IBC Trading Company, an export trading company which is currently inactive;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | IBC Subsidiary Corporation, a second‑tier bank holding company incorporated in the State of Delaware;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | IBC Charitable and Community Development Corporation, a Texas nonprofit corporation formed to conduct charitable and community development activities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | IBC Capital Corporation, a company incorporated in the State of Delaware for the purpose of holding certain investments; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Premier Tierra Holdings, Inc., a liquidating subsidiary formed under the laws of the State of Texas.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We also own a fifty percent interest in Gulfstar Group I and II, Ltd. and related entities, which are involved in investment banking activities, a controlling interest in four merchant banking entities, and a majority ownership in a real-estate development partnership.
 Available Information
 Our Annual Report on Form 10‑K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10‑Q, Current Reports on Form 8‑K, and amendments to those reports, as well as our Proxy Statements, are available free of charge on or through our website, www.ibc.com.  We have also posted on the website a Code of Ethics that applies to our directors and executive officers, and charters for our Audit Committee, Risk Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating Committee.  Services and Employees
 Our Subsidiary Banks have historically focused on providing commercial banking services to small and medium sized businesses located in their trade areas and select international banking services.  In recent years, however, the Subsidiary Banks have emphasized consumer and retail banking, including mortgage lending, as well as locating branches in retail locations and shopping malls.  Today, we have 189 facilities and 287 ATMs serving 89 communities in Texas and Oklahoma.
 Through the Subsidiary Banks, we are engaged in the business of accepting checking and savings deposits and the making of commercial, real estate, personal, home improvement, automobile and other installment and term loans. Some Subsidiary Banks are very active in facilitating international trade along the United States border with Mexico and elsewhere. Our international banking business includes providing letters of credit, making commercial and industrial loans and providing foreign exchange services. Each Subsidiary Bank also offers other related services, such as credit cards, safety deposit boxes, collections, notary public, escrow services, drive up and walk up facilities and other customary banking services. 
 Each Subsidiary Bank makes available certain securities products through third party providers, as well as banking services during traditional and nontraditional banking hours through their ATM network and retail locations in shopping malls and other convenient places. Additionally, IBC also has introduced IBC Bank Online, an Internet banking product, in order to provide customers online access to banking information and services 24 hours a day, as well as, IBC Mobile Banking with access from mobile devices 24 hours a day.  No material portion of our business may be deemed seasonal.
 As of December 31, 2018, we and our Subsidiary Banks employed approximately 2,816 persons full time and 574 persons part time.  We provide extensive training to our employees in an effort to ensure that our customers receive superior customer service.  None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement.  We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
 Competition
 We are one of the largest independent financial bank holding companies in the State of Texas.  Our primary market area is bordered on the east by the Galveston area, the northwest by Dallas, the southwest by Del Rio and to the southeast by Brownsville.  Our primary market area also includes the State of Oklahoma. We compete for deposits and loans with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions in our primary market area.  We have increased our market share in our primary market area in the past through strategic acquisitions.  
 We also compete against non‑bank entities, which serve as an alternative to traditional financial institutions. The percentage of bank related services being provided by non‑bank entities has increased during the last several years.
 We do a large amount of business for customers domiciled in Mexico, with an emphasis in Northern Mexico. Deposits from persons and entities domiciled in Mexico comprise a large and stable portion of the deposit base of the Subsidiary Banks. These deposits comprised approximately 29%, 27% and 28% of the Subsidiary Banks total deposits for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

 Under the Gramm Leach Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (GLBA), banks, securities firms and insurance companies may affiliate under an entity known as a financial holding company, which may then serve its customers’ varied financial needs through a single corporate structure. The GLBA has significantly changed the competitive environment in which we and our Subsidiary Banks conduct business. The financial services industry is also likely to become even more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. These technological advances may reduce the necessity of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties.
 Supervision and Regulation
 Banking is a complex, highly regulated industry.  In addition to the generally applicable state and federal laws governing businesses and employers, we and our Subsidiary Banks are further extensively regulated by special federal and state laws governing financial institutions. These laws comprehensively regulate the operations of the Subsidiary Banks and include, among other matters:
· | requirements to maintain reserves against deposits;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | restrictions on the amounts, terms and conditions of loans to directors, officers, large shareholders and their affiliates; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | restrictions related to investments in activities other than banking; and minimum capital requirements.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     
Furthermore, Congress, state legislatures and applicable federal and state regulatory agencies are continually reviewing such statutes, regulations and policies.  Any change in such laws or policies applicable to us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or our results of operations.  Recent political developments, including the change in the United States’ administration, have increased uncertainty with respect to the implementation, scope and timing of regulatory reforms.  With few exceptions, state and federal banking laws have as their principal objective either the maintenance of the safety and soundness of the federal deposit insurance system or the protection of consumers, rather than the specific protection of our shareholders or creditors.

Further, our earnings are affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the FRB, which regulates the national money supply in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures. These monetary policies significantly influence the overall growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, as well as, the interest rates charged on loans or paid on time and savings deposits. The nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on our future earnings and business cannot be predicted.
 The Dodd-Frank Act
 On July 21, 2010, sweeping financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the “Dodd‑Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act” (Dodd‑Frank Act) was signed into law. The Dodd‑Frank Act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry, addressing, among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance assessments, consumer financial protection, interchange fees, derivatives, lending limits, mortgage lending practices, registration of investment advisors and changes among the bank regulatory agencies.  These far‑reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape include provisions that, among other things, have or will:
· | Centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection in a new agency named the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Restrict the preemption of state law by federal law;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | Apply the same leverage and risk‑based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Require financial holding companies, to be well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital, eliminate the ceiling on the size of the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) and increase the floor of the size of the DIF;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Impose comprehensive regulation of over the counter derivatives market, which would include certain provisions that would effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses in the institution itself;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Require publicly traded bank holding companies with at least $10 billion in assets to create a risk committee to be chaired by an independent director, with at least one member with risk management expertise.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Require annual stress testing of certain financial institutions with consolidated assets greater than $10 billion, but, at this time, none of the Subsidiary Banks meets the $10 billion asset threshold required to conduct the bank stress tests;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Implement corporate governance revisions, including an advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation and proxy access by shareholders;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Make permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance and increase the cash limit of Securities Investor Protection Corporation protection from $100,000 to $250,000;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to give the FRB authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees, which must be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increase the authority of the FRB to examine us and our Subsidiary Banks;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Permit interstate de novo branching without the need to acquire an existing bank;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Require extensive new restrictions relating to residential mortgage transactions to increase compliance for financial institutions that originate mortgage loans;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Establish a Whistleblower Incentives and Protection Program for public company employees;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Require each agency to establish an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion and to develop diversity assessment standards for all the entities regulated by the agencies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Require the federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in short term proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Authorize the FRB to adopt enhanced supervision and prudential standards for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $250 billion (as modified by EGRRCPA) or more (often referred to as “systemically important financial institutions” or “SIFI”).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective upon enactment, while others were subject to further study, SEC rulemaking and discretion afforded to federal regulators.  Some provisions have only recently taken effect or will take effect in the future making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us, our customers or the financial industry in general. Provisions in the legislation that affect deposit insurance assessments, payment of interest on demand deposits and interchange fees are likely to increase the costs associated with deposits, as well as place limitations on certain revenues those deposits may generate. Provisions that require revisions to our capital requirements could require us to seek other sources of capital in the future. 
 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act
 On October 3, 2008, President Bush signed into law the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA), which, among other measures, authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Under TARP, the Treasury created a capital purchase program (CPP), pursuant to which it provided access to capital that serves as Tier 1 capital to financial institutions through a standardized program to acquire preferred stock (accompanied by warrants) from eligible financial institutions. Subsequently, we sold $216 million of Series A Preferred Stock to the Treasury and a warrant (Warrant) to purchase 1,326,238 shares of our class of common stock at a price per share of $24.43 per share that expired on December 23, 2018.

 In November 2012, we repurchased all of the Series A Preferred Stock and exited the TARP program.  In 2013, the Treasury sold the Warrant to a third party.  On September 18, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to repurchase the Warrant from the third party at an aggregate purchase price of $29,005,000, which transaction was consummated in the third quarter of 2018.  The repurchase of the outstanding Warrant eliminates any restrictions on certain shareholder distributions or payments of cash dividends in excess of $0.33 per semi-annual period that would have impacted the exercise price of the Warrant while it remained outstanding.
 FRB Approvals
 As a registered bank holding company we are subject to supervision by, among others, the FRB. As such, we are required to file with the FRB annual reports and other information regarding our business operations and those of our Subsidiary Banks. We are also subject to periodic examination by the FRB. Under the BHCA, a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring direct or indirect control of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company, and must engage only in the business of banking, managing, controlling banks and furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiary banks, except where the FRB has determined the ownership to be so closely related to banking, managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.
 The BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978 require that either FRB approval must be obtained or notice must be furnished to the FRB and not disapproved prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a bank holding company, subject to exception for certain transactions. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if any person acquires 25% or more of the voting securities of a bank holding company; control is a rebuttable presumption between 10% and 25% ownership.  Ownership by affiliated persons, or persons acting in concert, is typically aggregated for these purposes.
 As a bank holding company, we are required to obtain approval prior to merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company, acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or acquiring ownership or control of shares of a bank or bank holding company if, after the acquisition, we would directly or indirectly own or control 5% or more of the voting shares of such bank or bank holding company.  In approving acquisitions or the addition of activities, one of the issues the FRB considers is whether the acquisition or the additional activities can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh such possible adverse effects as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices.
 The USA PATRIOT Act
 Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is a major focus of financial institution regulatory policy. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (PATRIOT Act), substantially expanded the responsibilities of U.S. financial institutions with respect to countering money laundering and terrorist activities. The implementing regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Also, the PATRIOT Act requires the bank regulatory agencies to consider the record of a bank or bank holding company in combating money laundering activities in their evaluation of bank and bank holding company merger or acquisition transactions. Anti-money laundering regulations are continually evolving, including recent new requirements effective May 11, 2018 requiring U.S. financial institutions to ascertain and document the beneficial owners of legal entity customers opening new accounts.
 We have a program in place to monitor and enforce our policies on money laundering, corruption and bribery, as well as our policies on prohibiting the use of Company assets to finance or otherwise aid alleged terrorist groups. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.

 Nonresident Alien Deposits
 In 2013, the IRS published a rule requiring U.S. banks to report on the interest they pay to nonresident alien individuals, and the IRS will share the information with tax authorities in other countries with whom the United States has an agreement regarding the exchange of tax information.  Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
 On July 1, 2014, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) became effective. Originally enacted in 2010, FATCA is aimed at curbing offshore tax evasion by foreign financial institutions by requiring such institutions to identify any U.S. account holders.  Moreover, FATCA requires U.S. withholding agents, including U.S. banks, to withhold a tax (30%) on U.S. sourced income payable to foreign financial institutions that do not agree to report certain information to the IRS regarding their U.S. accounts, as well as on payments to nonfinancial foreign entities that do not provide information on their U.S. account owners to withholding agents. Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
 The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. The Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (OFAC) publishes lists of specially designated countries and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. The OFAC administered sanctions take many forms, including restrictions on trade or investment and the blocking of certain assets related to the designated foreign countries and nationals. Blocked assets, which may include bank deposits, cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with the OFAC sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. Gramm Leach Bliley
 The GLBA eliminates the barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurance companies and other financial service providers. The GLBA provides for a new type of financial holding company structure under which affiliations among these entities may occur. Under the GLBA, a financial holding company may engage in a broad list of financial activities and any non‑financial activity that the FRB determines is complementary to a financial activity and poses no substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system. In addition, the GLBA permitted certain non‑banking financial and financially related activities to be conducted by financial subsidiaries of banks.
 Under the GLBA, a bank holding company may become certified as a financial holding company by filing a declaration with the FRB, together with a certification that each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized, is well managed, and has at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA). We elected and were approved by the FRB to become a financial holding company under the GLBA in 2000 and the election was made effective by the FRB as of March 13, 2000. During the second quarter of 2000, IBC established an insurance agency subsidiary and acquired two insurance agencies. 
 The investments that may be made under the GLBA are substantially broader in scope than the investment activities otherwise permissible for bank holding companies and are referred to as “merchant banking investments” in “portfolio companies.” The FRB and the Secretary of the Treasury have regulations governing the scope of permissible merchant banking investments.  Before making a merchant banking investment, a financial holding company must either be or have a registered securities firm or a qualified insurance affiliate. The merchant banking investments may be made by the financial holding company or any of its subsidiaries, other than a depository institution or a subsidiary of a depository institution. The regulations place restrictions on the ability of a financial holding company to become involved in the routine management or operation of any portfolio company. The regulation also generally limits the ownership period of merchant banking investments to no more than ten years.

 The FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the FDIC have rules governing the regulatory capital treatment of equity investments in non‑financial companies held by banks, bank holding companies and financial holding companies. The rules apply a graduated capital charge on covered equity investments, which would increase as the proportion of such investments to Tier 1 capital increases.
 On September 8, 2016, the FRB published a report to Congress in which it recommended the repeal of the merchant banking authority granted to financial holding companies under the GLBA.  Specifically, the FRB recommended that Congress repeal the statutory merchant banking authority and the grandfathering exemption for certain companies that became financial holding companies after 1999.  The FRB also noted in its report that it is considering regulatory measures that would limit what it termed “safety and soundness risks of merchant banking investments.”  It is uncertain what, if any, action the FRB or Congress will take regarding the FRB’s report.
 State Law Preemption
 At the beginning of 2004, the OCC issued final rules clarifying when federal law overrides state law for national banks and their operating subsidiaries and confirming that only the OCC has the right to examine and take enforcement action against those institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, limits the applicability of the preemption doctrine so that state laws affecting national banks are preempted only in certain circumstances. In this regard, the OCC has concluded that the Dodd‑Frank Act did not create a new, standalone preemption standard, but rather, existing OCC regulations are “preserved,” including federal preemption over state consumer protection laws. The OCC also clarified that a state attorney general or chief law enforcement officer may enforce any applicable law against a national bank (as opposed to a non‑preempted state law), and to seek relief if, and as, authorized by that law.  Financial Privacy
 In accordance with the GLBA, the federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. Pursuant to these rules, financial institutions must provide disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party in some instances.
 Additional regulations were adopted to implement the provisions of the Fair Access to Credit Transactions Act (FACTA), which requires certain disclosures and consents to share certain information among bank affiliates. These privacy provisions affect how customer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. These privacy provisions also have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period, after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers, before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of cross‑selling products and services between those affiliated companies.  On December 4, 2015, the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) was signed into law.  Part of the FAST Act amended the GLBA by providing financial institutions with an exception to the general requirement that those institutions deliver annual privacy notices.  
 NASDAQ Listing Standards
 Shares of our common stock are listed and trade on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol “IBOC”. As such, we must comply with the quantitative and qualitative listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market. In addition to other matters, the listing standards address disclosure requirements and standards relating to board independence and other corporate governance matters. Interstate Banking
 The Riegle‑Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Interstate Banking Act), rewrote federal law governing the interstate expansion of banks in the United States. Under the Interstate Banking Act, adequately capitalized, well managed bank holding companies with FRB approval may acquire banks located in any state in the United States, provided that the target bank meets the minimum age established by the host state (maximum of five years in Texas). Under the Interstate Banking Act, an anti‑concentration limit will bar interstate acquisitions that would give a bank 

 
  9

 
holding company control of more than ten percent of all deposits nationwide or thirty percent of any one state’s deposits, or such higher or lower percentage established by the host state. The anti‑concentration limit in each of Texas and Oklahoma has been set at twenty percent of all federally insured deposits in Texas and Oklahoma, respectively. The Dodd‑Frank Act changes the requirements for interstate branching by permitting de novo interstate branching if, under the laws of the state where the new branch is to be established, a state bank chartered in that state would be permitted to establish a branch.
 FRB Enforcement Powers
 The FRB has certain divestiture and other powers over bank holding companies and non‑banking subsidiaries where their actions would constitute a serious threat to the safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary bank. These powers may be exercised through the issuance of cease and desist orders or other actions. In the event a Subsidiary Bank experiences either a significant loan loss or rapid growth of loans or deposits, we may be compelled by the FRB to invest additional capital in the Subsidiary Bank. Further, we would be required to guarantee performance of the capital restoration plan of any undercapitalized Subsidiary Bank.
 The FRB is also empowered to assess civil money penalties against companies or individuals who violate the BHCA in amounts up to $1,000,000 per day, order termination of non‑banking activities of non‑banking subsidiaries and order termination of ownership and control of a non‑banking subsidiary. Under certain circumstances the Texas Banking Commissioner may bring enforcement proceedings against a bank holding company in Texas.
 Company Dividends
 Our holding company is regarded as a legal entity separate and distinct from our Subsidiary Banks and is subject to regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The ability of our holding company to pay dividends is largely dependent on the amount of cash derived from dividends declared by our Subsidiary Banks.  The payment of dividends by any bank or bank holding company is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital.  Under FRB policy, bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected capital needs and financial condition.  The policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries.  In addition, in the current financial and economic environment, the FRB has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong.

The ability of the Subsidiary Banks to pay dividends is also restricted under Texas and Oklahoma law.  A Texas bank generally may not pay a dividend reducing its capital and surplus without the prior approval of the Texas Banking Commissioner.  An Oklahoma bank generally may not pay a dividend reducing its capital and surplus without the prior approval of the Oklahoma Department of Banking.  The FDIC has the right to prohibit the payment of dividends by a bank where the payment is deemed to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. 
 At December 31, 2018, there was an aggregate of approximately $768,900,000 available for the payment of dividends to our holding company by our Subsidiary Banks under the capital rules applicable as of December 31, 2018, assuming that each of such banks continues to be classified as “well capitalized.”  Further, we could expend the entire $768,900,000 and continue to be classified as “well capitalized” under the capital rules applicable as of December 31, 2018.
 Source of Strength Doctrine
 FRB policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd‑Frank Act codifies this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, we are expected to commit resources to support our Subsidiary Banks, including at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary 

 
  10

 
banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. In addition to the foregoing requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act’s provisions authorize the FRB and other federal banking regulators to require a company that directly or indirectly controls a bank to submit reports that are designed both to assess the ability of such company to comply with its “source of strength” obligations and to enforce the company’s compliance with these obligations.  

The OCC, FRB and FDIC are developing a joint Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which will be published in the Federal Register.  The rule, when finalized, will require the appropriate federal banking agencies to jointly issue final rules that ensure that parent companies of subsidiary insured depository institutions serve as a source of financial strength for such institutions.  As of December 31, 2018 the FRB and other federal banking regulators have not yet issued rules implementing this requirement.
 Deposit Insurance
 All of the Subsidiary Banks are examined by the FDIC, which currently insures the deposits of each member bank up to applicable limits. The FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or uninsured condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule or order of condition imposed by the FDIC.  
 Deposits of each of the Subsidiary Banks are insured by the FDIC through the DIF to the extent provided by law. The FDIC uses a risk based assessment system that imposes premiums based upon a matrix that takes into account a bank’s capital level and supervisory rating. The initial base assessment rates for Risk Category 1 institutions range from 12 to 16 basis points, on an annualized basis. After the effect of potential base‑rate adjustments, total base assessment rates range from 7 to 24 basis points.
 The FDIC adopted a new DIF restoration plan in 2010 to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd‑Frank Act. Under the new restoration plan, the FDIC will maintain the current schedule of assessment rates for all depository institutions. At least semi‑annually, however, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the fund and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice and comment rulemaking if required.
 In 2011, the FDIC issued a final rule that set a target size for the insurance fund and changed the deposit insurance assessment base from total domestic deposits to average total assets minus average tangible equity, as required by the Dodd‑Frank Act. The rule finalizes a target size for the DIF at 2 percent of insured deposits. It also implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the fund reaches 1.15 percent and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 2 percent and 2.5 percent. The final rule also creates a risk based scorecard assessment system for banks with more than $10 billion in assets. The scorecards include financial measures that the FDIC believes are predictive of long‑term performance. The FDIC also issued new guidelines that reflect the methodology it now uses to determine assessment rates for large and highly complex institutions. A “large institution” is defined as an insured depository institution with assets of $10 billion or more, and a “highly complex institution” is defined as an insured depository institution with assets of $50 billion or more. At this time, none of the Subsidiary Banks meet the definition of a large institution under the new guidelines.
 A surcharge was proposed by the FDIC in 2016 on the quarterly assessments of insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more.  The surcharge is 4.5 cents per $100 of their assessment base.  The FDIC expects the reserve ratio will likely reach 1.35 percent after approximately two years of payments of the surcharges.  Our FDIC deposit insurance expense totaled $3,742,000, $3,294,000 and $5,777,000 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 The FDIC proposed new requirements, which became effective in 2017, for insured depository institutions with at least 2 million deposit accounts to impose new recordkeeping standards and deposit insurance calculation requirements for these institutions.  The institutions also are required to ensure that their information technology (IT) systems are capable of calculating the amount of insured money for most depositors within 24 hours of a failure.

 Capital Adequacy
 Our holding company and our Subsidiary Banks are required to meet certain minimum regulatory capital guidelines.  The FRB has historically utilized a system based upon risk-based capital guidelines under a two-tier capital framework to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies.  Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stockholders’ equity, retained earnings, a limited amount of qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities and non-controlling interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and certain intangibles.  Tier 2 capital generally consists of certain hybrid capital instruments and perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt securities and a limited amount of subordinated debt, qualifying preferred stock, loan loss allowance, and unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities.  

The federal authorities’ risk based capital guidelines utilize total capital to risk weighted assets and Tier 1 capital elements.  In this way, the guidelines make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, consider off balance sheet exposure in assessing capital adequacy and encourage the holding of liquid, low risk assets.  At least one half of the minimum total capital is required to be comprised of Core Capital or Tier 1 capital elements.  Our Tier 1 capital is comprised of common shareholders’ equity and permissible amounts related to the trust preferred securities. The deductible core deposit intangibles and goodwill booked in connection with all our financial institution acquisitions after February 1992 are deducted from the sum of core capital elements when determining our capital ratios.

In addition, the FRB has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies.  These guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average quarterly assets (“leverage ratio”) equal to three percent for bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating.  All other bank holding companies will generally be required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least four to five percent.  Our leverage ratio at December 31, 2018 was 15.87%.  

The guidelines also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets.  Each of our Subsidiary Banks is subject to similar capital requirements adopted by the FDIC and had a leverage ratio in excess of five percent as of December 31, 2018.
 The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted regulations which mandate a five‑tier scheme of capital requirements and corresponding supervisory actions to implement the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA. The regulations include requirements for the capital categories that will serve as benchmarks for mandatory supervisory actions. Under the regulations, the highest of the five categories would be a well- capitalized institution with a total risk‑based capital ratio of 10%, a Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of 6% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%. An institution would be prohibited from declaring any dividends, making any other capital distribution or paying a management fee if the capital ratios drop below the levels for an adequately capitalized institution, which are 8%, 4% and 4%, respectively. The corresponding provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Improvement Act (FDICIA) mandate corrective actions are taken if a bank is undercapitalized. Based on our capital ratios as of December 31, 2018, our holding company and each of the Subsidiary Banks were classified as “well capitalized” under the applicable regulations. 
 The risk‑based standards that apply to bank holding companies and banks incorporate market and interest rate risk components. Applicable banking institutions are required to adjust their risk‑based capital ratio to reflect market risk. Under the market risk capital guidelines, capital is allocated to support the amount of market risk related to a financial institution’s ongoing trading activities. Financial institutions are allowed to issue qualifying unsecured subordinated debt (Tier 3 capital) to meet a part of their market risks. We do not have any Tier 3 capital and did not need Tier 3 capital to offset market risks. In 2010, the federal bank regulators issued a final risk‑based capital rule related to new accounting standards that make substantive changes in how banking organizations account for more items, including securitized assets that previously had been taken off banks’ balance sheets. The Dodd‑Frank Act directed the banking agencies to issue capital requirements for banking institutions that are countercyclical. These will require a higher level of capital to be maintained in times of economic expansion and a lower level of capital during times of economic contraction.

 Basel III
 In July 2013, the FRB and the FDIC published the Basel III Capital Rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations.  The rules implemented the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s -- a college of central bankers and other financial regulators from the United States and other advanced economies -- December 2010 framework known as “Basel III” for strengthening international capital standards, as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.  Basel III requires bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity.
 The Basel III final capital framework, among other things, (i) introduces as a new capital measure “Common Equity Tier 1” (CET1), (ii) specifies that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) defines CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expands the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations.
 Basel III also provides for a “countercyclical capital buffer,” generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk weighted assets above the minimum, but below the conservation buffer, will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income” (meaning, four quarter trailing income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income).
 The Basel III capital rules include the new components of “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)” (AOCI) that factors into the calculation of CET1 all net unrealized gains (losses) on available for sale securities. The definition also establishes the expectation that the majority of Common Equity Tier 1 should be voting shares. Basel III creates a category referred to as “High Volatility CRE,” which has a risk weight of 150% and generally includes nonresidential real estate acquisition development or construction financing. Basel III requires the phase‑out from Tier 1 capital of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred stock over a ten‑year time period.
 Further, the Basel III capital rules establish calculations for risk‑weighted assets using alternatives to credit ratings that would be based on either the weighted average of the underlying collateral or a formula based on subordination position and delinquencies or the use of a 1,250% risk rating, which would be the default rating if requisite standards of a comprehensive understanding and levels of the due diligence are not met. Securitized structures, such as private label mortgage backed securities, may be risk weighted based on a gross up approach considering underlying assets, otherwise they default to the 1,250% risk weight.
 On the quality of capital side, the final Basel III capital rule emphasized Common Equity Tier 1 capital, the most loss absorbing form of capital, and implements strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. The final rule also improved the methodology for calculating risk‑weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity. The banking agencies made a number of changes in the final rule, in particular, to address concerns about regulatory burden on community banks. For example, the final rule is significantly different from the proposal in terms of risk weighting for residential mortgages and the regulatory capital treatment of certain unrealized gains and losses on trust preferred securities for common banking organizations.
 Our phase‑in period for mandatory compliance with the final Basel III rule was January 1, 2015.  A key provision of the rules permitted us to make a one‑time irrevocable election to determine how most items reported in AOCI will be handled for regulatory capital purposes. For institutions that opt out, most AOCI items will not be included in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 capital; institutions that do not opt out will have most AOCI items included in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, which affects the institution’s legal lending limit calculation. If a top tier banking organization makes the AOCI opt out election, all consolidated banking subsidiary organizations under it must make the same election. We made the AOCI opt out election in 2015.

 Under Basel III capital rules, the initial minimum capital ratios that became effective on January 1, 2015 are as follows:

· | 4.5% CET1 to risk‑weighted assets;
--+-----------------------------------


· | 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk‑weighted assets;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | 8.0% Total capital to risk‑weighted assets; and
--+------------------------------------------------


· | 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets.
--+-------------------------------------------------

  Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and was phased in over a four‑year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and was phased in over a four‑year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1), until it reached 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
 The Basel III capital rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk weighting categories from four categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%), to a much larger and more risk sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities to 600% for certain equity exposures, resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. Specific changes to the rules impacting our determination of risk‑weighted assets include, among other things:

· | Applying a 150% risk weight instead of a 100% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Assigning a 150% risk weight to exposures (other than residential mortgage exposures) that are 90 days past due;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Providing for a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (currently set at 0%);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Providing for a risk weight, generally not less than 20% with certain exceptions, for securities lending transactions based on the risk weight category of the underlying collateral securing the transaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Providing for a 100% risk weight for claims on securities firms; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Eliminating the current 50% cap on the risk weight for OTC derivatives.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, the Basel III capital rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase‑style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation.
 On November 21, 2017, the OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC finalized a proposed rule that extends the current treatment under the regulatory capital rules for certain regulatory capital deductions and risk weights and certain minority interest requirements, as they apply to banking organizations that are not subject to the advanced approaches capital rules.  Effective January 1, 2018, the rule also pauses the full transition to the Basel III treatment of mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and minority interests.  The agencies are also considering whether to make adjustments to the capital rules in response to CECL (the FASB Standard relating to current expected credit loss) and its potential impact on regulatory capital.

On December 7, 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision unveiled the latest round of its regulatory capital framework, commonly called “Basel IV.”  The framework makes changes to the capital framework first introduced as “Basel III” in 2010.  The committee targeted 2022-2027 as the timeframe for implementation by regulators in individual countries, including the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies (after notice and comment).

In December 2018, the federal bank regulators issued a final rule that would provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one regulatory capital effects of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” as amended, on January 1, 2020.

 Basel III Prompt Corrective Action

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (FDIA), requires the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA includes the following five capital tiers: (i) “well capitalized;” (ii) “adequately capitalized;” (iii) “undercapitalized;” (iv) “significantly undercapitalized;” and (v) “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The relevant capital measures which reflect changes under the Basel III capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2015, are the total capital ratio, the CET1 capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio and the leverage ratio.  A bank will be considered:
· | “well capitalized” if the institution has a total risk‑based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater (6.0% prior to January 1, 2015), and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by an such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | “adequately capitalized” if the institution has a total risk‑based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater (4.0% prior to January 1, 2015), and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not “well capitalized”;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | “undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk‑based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of less than 6.0% (4.0% prior to January 1, 2015) or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | “significantly undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk‑based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 3%, a Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of less than 4.0% (3.0% prior to January 1, 2015) or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | “critically undercapitalized” if the institution’s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     
An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank’s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.
 The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be “undercapitalized.” “Undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The agencies may not accept such a plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5.0% of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized, and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.”
 The appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances, reclassify a well capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized. The FDIA provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking agency determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice.

 As of December 31, 2018, each of our Subsidiary Banks are “well capitalized” based on the aforementioned ratios pursuant to the Basel III capital rules.
 Liquidity Requirements
 Historically, regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without required formulaic measures. The Basel III final framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward will be required by regulation. 
 The Basel III liquidity coverage ratio was published in 2013 and uses international liquidity standards that serve to reconcile the differences of the liquidity standards of countries. The Basel Committee is expected to address the net stable funding ratio in the future. These new standards are subject to further rulemaking and their terms may well change before implementation. The federal bank regulatory agencies also issued a proposed rule that would implement qualitative liquidity requirements, including a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), consistent with liquidity standards adopted by the Basel Committee, for certain banking organizations with more than $250 billion in total assets or subsidiary depository institutions of internationally active banking organizations with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The FRB issued a separate proposed rule at the same time to apply a modified version of the LCR to certain depository institution holding companies with assets greater than $50 billion. The final version of the rule defines banks with between $50 billion and $250 billion in assets as “modified LCR companies,” which will be subjected to less rigorous requirements regarding the high‑quality liquid assets calculations.
 In July 2018, following the enactment of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (“EGRRCPA”), the Federal Reserve Board stated that it would no longer require bank holding companies with less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets to comply with the modified version of the LCR.  In October 2018, the federal banking regulators further proposed to revise their liquidity requirements so that banking organizations that are not globally systemic important banks and have less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $75 billion in each of off-balance sheet exposures, nonbank assets, cross-jurisdictional activity and short-term wholesale funding would not be subject to any LCR or net stable funding ratio requirements.
 FASB CECL Accounting Standard
 In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 to ASC 326, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses,” (CECL).  The accounting standards update amends existing standards for credit losses on financial assets.  The change in accounting standard requires that the expected credit losses on financial instruments held as of the end of the period be measured based on historical loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  The update also amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and financial assets purchased with credit deterioration. The accounting standard change will be effective for us for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019.  The change in accounting method represents a significant difference to current accounting practice over the accounting for credit losses on financial assets.  We are not able to estimate the impact of the accounting change at this time.  
 State Enforcement Powers
 The Banking Commissioners of Texas and Oklahoma may determine to close a Texas or Oklahoma state bank, respectively, when such Commissioner finds that the interests of depositors and creditors of a state bank are jeopardized through its insolvency or imminent insolvency and that it is in the best interest of such depositors and creditors that the bank be closed. The Texas Department of Banking and Oklahoma State Banking Department also have broad enforcement powers over the Subsidiary Banks, as applicable, including the power to impose orders, remove officers and directors, impose fines and appoint supervisors and conservators.

 Depositor Preference
 Because our holding company is a legal entity separate and distinct from our Subsidiary Banks, it’s our holding company’s right to participate in the distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon the subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. In the event of a liquidation or other resolution of a Subsidiary Bank, the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors of the bank are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of any obligation of the institution to its shareholders, including any depository institution holding company or any shareholder or creditor. Community Reinvestment Act
 Under the CRA, the FDIC is required to assess the record of each Subsidiary Bank to determine if the bank meets the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate‑income neighborhoods served by the institution, and to take that record into account in its evaluation of any application made by the bank for, among other things, approval of the acquisition or establishment of a branch or other deposit facility, an office relocation, a merger, or the acquisition of shares of capital stock of another financial institution. The FDIC prepares a written evaluation of an institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community and assigns a rating. Federal banking agencies make public a rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA. The Subsidiary Banks conduct an award winning financial literacy program in their communities as part of their community outreach. 
 There are also fair lending laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, which prohibit discrimination in connection with lending decisions. The bank regulators periodically conduct fair lending evaluations of banks. One of our Subsidiary Banks received an “Outstanding” CRA rating, and the rest received a “Satisfactory” CRA rating in their most recently completed examinations. Financial institutions are evaluated under different CRA examinations procedures based upon their asset size classification, which asset thresholds are updated annually and were updated as of January 1, 2018. “Large institution” now means a bank with total assets of at least $1.221 billion for December 31 of both of the prior two calendar years and “intermediate small institution” means an institution with assets of at least $305 million and less than $1.221 billion as of December 31 of both of the prior two calendar years. Three of our Subsidiary Banks are considered “intermediate small institutions” and IBC and IBC Oklahoma are considered “large institutions” under the new asset thresholds.  
 Consumer Laws
 In addition to the laws and regulations discussed herein, the Subsidiary Banks are also subject to numerous consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers. The Subsidiary Banks must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of their ongoing customer relations. The Dodd‑Frank Act provides comprehensive new rules regulating mortgage activities and created the CFPB with direct supervisory authority over banks with assets of $10 billion or more and certain nonbank entities.
 The CFPB has broad authority, among other matters, to declare acts or practices to be “unfair, deceptive, or abusive,” and to develop and require new consumer disclosures. While the CFPB does not currently have direct supervisory authority over any of our Subsidiary Banks because they each fall below the $10 billion assets threshold, the CFPB’s broad authority to issue, interpret, and enforce almost all federal consumer protection laws, and its issuance of applicable disclosure forms, will significantly impact each of the Subsidiary Banks’ consumer compliance programs. 
 The CFPB proposed major small dollar loan consumer protection regulations in 2016, including payday loans, vehicle title loans and certain high-cost installment loans.  Two categories of loans are covered; loans with a term of 45 days or less; or loans with multiple advances if each advance is required to be repaid within 45 days.  The second category includes loans with terms greater than 45 days, provided that they have an all-in annual percentage rate higher than 36 percent, and either are repaid directly from the consumer’s account or income or are secured by the consumer’s vehicle.  The proposed rules focus on practices involving consumer’s ability to repay their loans and other practices related to withdrawing payments from consumers’ accounts.  Several types of consumer credit would be excluded, including:  loans

extended solely to finance the purchase of a car or other consumer good in which the good secures the loan; home mortgages and other loans secured by real property or a dwelling if recorded or perfected; credit cards; student loans; non-recourse pawn loans; and overdraft services and lines of credit.  On October 5, 2017, the CFPB finalized the small dollar loan rule.  On February 6, 2019, the CFPB announced that it was amending this small dollar loan rule further and delaying its effective date to November 19, 2020.
    
In light of the new administration in Washington, DC and the change in the CFPB’s executive director, we cannot predict what additional actions may be taken by the CFPB with respect to its previous regulations, rulings and decisions and any impact on our operations.
     Military Lending Act
 In 2015, the Department of Defense issued final amendments to the rule that implements the federal Military Lending Act.  Under the amended rule, the Department of Defense expanded the definition of “consumer credit” to include a much broader range of credit products, including some credit products offered by depository institutions.  The rule requires lenders to provide certain protections to borrowers who are covered under the rule.  For instance, lenders must cap the Military Annual Percentage Rule for covered credit products provided to covered borrowers at 36%.  Lenders must also provide certain disclosures and other protections to covered borrowers.  Although a lender can use any method to determine a borrower’s military status, the lender can obtain a safe harbor by verifying the borrower’s military status either through the Department of Defense Manpower Data Center or by using a consumer credit report that contains military status. Electronic Banking and Cyber Security
 The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) issued guidance in 2005 entitled “Authentication in an Internet Banking Environment” (2005 Guidance), which provided a risk management framework for financial institutions offering Internet‑based products and services to their customers. The 2005 Guidance required that institutions use effective methods to authenticate the identity of customers and that the techniques employed be commensurate with the risks associated with the products and services offered and the protection of sensitive customer information. The FDIC and other FFIEC agencies supplemented the 2005 Guidance by specifying the FDIC’s supervisory expectations regarding customer authentication, layered security, and other controls in an increasingly hostile online environment. The FDIC indicated that layered security controls should include processes to detect and respond to suspicious or anomalous activity and, for business accounts, administrative controls. In 2011, the Texas Banking Commissioner and the U.S. Secret Service formed the Bankers Electronic Crimes Task Force and issued guidance entitled “Best Practices: Reducing the Risks of Corporate Account Takeovers.” This guidance sets forth nineteen best practices to reduce the risk of corporate account takeover thefts. Our Subsidiary Banks are required to comply with these guidelines and best practices. 
 The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released a preliminary Framework for Approving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity in 2014. Our Subsidiary Banks are expected to incorporate the NIST Cybersecurity Framework into their security frameworks, which are also governed by FFIEC guidelines.  In 2016, the federal banking agencies proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards for large interconnected entities and their service providers.  The proposal establishes enhanced standards to increase the operational resilience of these entities and reduce the impact on the financial system in case of a cyber event experienced by one of these entities.  The standards address cyber risk governance, cyber risk management, internal dependency management, external dependency management, incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness.  The enhanced standards would be implemented in a tiered manner, imposing more stringent standards on the systems of those entities that are critical to the functioning of the financial sector. 
 Increasingly, state regulators are implementing additional privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations.  Recently, several states adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements for such programs, including data encryption requirements.  Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements.  We expect this trend to continue, and are continually monitoring developments in Texas and Oklahoma.

 Affiliate Transactions    Our holding company and Subsidiary Banks are “affiliates” within the meaning of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, which sets forth certain restrictions on (i) loans and extensions of credit between a bank subsidiary and affiliates, (ii) on investments in an affiliate’s stock or other securities, and (iii) on acceptance of such stock or other securities as collateral for loans. These restrictions prevent a bank holding company from borrowing from any of its bank subsidiaries, unless the loans are secured by specific obligations. Further, such secured loans and investments by a bank subsidiary are limited in amount, as to a bank holding company or any other affiliate, to 10% of such bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus and, as to the bank holding company and its affiliates, to an aggregate of 20% of such bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus. Certain restrictions do not apply to 80% or more owned sister banks of bank holding companies. Each Subsidiary Bank is wholly‑owned by our holding company. 
 Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act requires that the terms of affiliate transactions be comparable to terms of similar non‑affiliate transactions. Among other things, the Dodd‑Frank Act expands the limitations on affiliate transactions by expanding the definitions of “affiliate” and “covered transactions,” including debt obligations of an affiliate utilized as collateral.  The Dodd-Frank Act also requires that the 10% of capital limit on covered transactions begin to apply to non‑bank financial subsidiaries. “Covered transactions” are defined to include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the FRB) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. While the Dodd‑Frank Act changes became effective in 2012, the FRB has not issued any guidance nor has it amended Regulation W.  Regulation W predates the Dodd-Frank Act and is expected to remain under any deregulation under the current administration. 
 Insider Loans
 The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal shareholders and their related interests contained in the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O apply to all insured institutions and their subsidiaries and holding companies. In general, any such extensions of credit must (i) not exceed certain dollar limitations, (ii) be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties, and (iii) not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.  Additional restrictions are imposed on extensions of credit to executive officers.  Certain extensions of credit also require the approval of a bank’s board of directors. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests.  These loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus, and the FDIC may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate.  Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions. Lending Restrictions
 The operations of the Subsidiary Banks are also subject to lending limit restrictions pertaining to the extension of credit and making of loans to one borrower. Under the BHCA and the FRB regulations, we are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements with respect to any extension of credit or provision of property or services.  The FRB adopted a rule relaxing tying restrictions by permitting a bank holding company to offer a discount on products or services if a customer obtains other products or services from such company. The banking agencies issued best practices guidelines on overdraft protection programs, which state that overdraft protection programs are an extension of credit, but are not subject to Truth in Lending disclosure requirements.  In 2009, the FRB issued final rules amending Regulation E that prohibit financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on ATM and one time debit card transactions, unless the consumer consents or opts‑in to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. In 2010, the FDIC issued final overdraft protection guidance, which focuses on automated overdraft programs and encourages banks to offer less costly alternatives. Additionally, the FDIC requires banks to monitor programs for excessive or chronic customer use and to undertake meaningful and effective follow‑up action thereafter, institute appropriate daily limits on customer costs, consider eliminating overdraft fees for transactions that overdraw an account by a de minimis amount, ensure that transactions are not processed in a manner designed to maximize the costs to consumers, and ensure that boards of directors provide appropriate oversight of overdraft protection programs.

 Commercial Real Estate Lending
 In 2006, the federal bank regulators issued interagency guidance titled “Concentration in Commercial Real Estate Lending: Sound Risk Management Practices.” The guidance focuses on the risks of high levels of concentration in CRE lending and identified two supervisory concentration levels. The first was the concentration level where loans for construction, land and land development represent 100% or more of a bank institution’s total risk‑based capital. The second was the CRE concentration where total non‑owner occupied CRE loans represent 300 percent or more of the institution’s total risk‑based capital and growth in total CRE lending has increased by 50 percent or more during the previous 36 months. The guidance states that the banking institutions exceeding the concentration levels should have in place enhanced credit risk controls, including stress‑testing of CRE portfolios and that the concentration levels may result in further supervisory analysis. Mortgage Lending
 In 2016, the CFPB amended certain mortgage rules issued in 2013.  This final rule clarifies, revises, or amends provisions regarding force-placed insurance notices, policies and procedures, early intervention, and loss mitigation requirements under Regulation X’s servicing provisions; and prompt crediting and periodic statement requirements under Regulation Z’s servicing provisions.  The final rule also addresses compliance when a consumer is in bankruptcy and makes technical corrections to several other provisions.    
 Also in October 2016, the CFPB also issued a final rule amending the mortgage servicing rules, most of which became effective on October 19, 2017, but the remainder of which becomes effective on April 19, 2018.  The CFPB issued this interpretive rule under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) to clarify the interaction of the FDCPA and mortgage servicing rules.  This interpretive rule constitutes an advisory opinion under FDCPA section 813(e) and provides a safe harbor from liability for actions done or omitted in good faith in conformity with the opinion.  The CFPB’s final rules also addresses insufficiency of hazard insurance which may lead to new requirements for lender-placed insurance, and early intervention with delinquent buyers will be governed by new contract obligations. 
 On November 30, 2016, the CFPB, FRB, and OCC finalized amendments to the official interpretations that implement special appraisal requirements for “higher-risk mortgages” or “higher-priced mortgages.”  Under the interpretations when there is no annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index, the OCC, FRB and CFPB will not adjust the exemption threshold from the prior year.  

On July 7, 2017, the CFPB modified the federal mortgage disclosure requirements under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Lending Act that are implemented in Regulation Z. This rule creates tolerances for the total of payments and provides guidance on sharing the integrated disclosures with various parties involved in the mortgage origination process.

On October 4, 2017, the CFPB issued an interim final rule and a proposed rule to provide mortgage servicers more flexibility and certainty around requirements to communicate with certain borrowers under the CFPB’s 2016 mortgage servicing amendments. The interim final rule gives servicers more flexibility regarding when to communicate about foreclosure prevention options with borrowers who have requested a cease in communication under federal debt collection law. The interim final rule became effective on Oct. 19, 2017, the same date that the related 2016 rule provisions become effective. The proposed rule has been finalized and is effective on April 19, 2018. It will impose mortgage servicing requirements which are complex and require significant changes to existing procedures and disclosures. All servicers must ensure they have comprehensive practices for responding to potential successors in interest and for confirming and communicating with them. Additionally, servicers will need to determine which of the CFPB’s three options to adopt for communicating with confirmed successors in interest, in a manner that ensures clarity and does not indicate an obligation to repay a mortgage. The CFPB also removed the blanket exemption from the periodic statement requirement for borrowers in bankruptcy, making it necessary to provide modified periodic statements – which will require significant system configurations and testing to ensure the new requirements are met.

 Powers
 As a result of FDICIA, the authority of the FDIC over state‑chartered banks was expanded. The FDICIA limits state chartered banks to only those principal activities permissible for national banks, except for other activities specifically approved by the FDIC. The Texas Banking Act includes a parity provision which establishes procedures for state banks to notify the Texas Banking Commissioner if the bank intends to conduct any activity permitted for a national bank that is otherwise denied to a state bank. The Texas Banking Commissioner has 30 days to prohibit the activity. Also, the Texas Finance Code includes a “super parity” provision with procedures for state banks to notify the Texas Banking Commissioner if the bank intends to conduct any activity permitted for any depository institution in the United States.   Texas Banking Commissioner has 30 days after receiving such notice to prohibit the activity.  Similarly, under the Oklahoma Banking Code, Oklahoma state banks have the authority to exercise such incidental powers as may be necessary or desirable to carry on the banking business including, but not limited to, powers conferred upon national banks, unless otherwise prohibited or limited by the Oklahoma Banking Commissioner or the Oklahoma State Banking Board.  Additionally, upon approval of the Oklahoma Banking Commissioner, and subject to all applicable federal and state laws, the operating subsidiaries or financial subsidiaries of an Oklahoma state bank may exercise any power and engage in any activity that is permitted for an operating subsidiary or financial subsidiary of a national bank, unless otherwise prohibited or limited by the Oklahoma Banking Commissioner or Oklahoma State Banking Board.   Incentive Compensation
 In June 2010, the FRB, OCC and FDIC issued the Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies, a comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk‑taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors.
 The FRB will review, as part of the regular, risk focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations. These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk‑management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
 The Dodd‑Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies and the SEC to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines that require financial institutions with $1 billion or more in assets to disclose to the appropriate federal regulator, the structure of all incentive‑based compensation arrangements sufficient to determine whether the compensation structure provides an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits, or could lead to material financial loss to the financial institutions. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would prohibit bank incentive‑based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking, are deemed excessive, or may lead to material losses. The proposal would apply to financial institutions with more than $1 billion in assets.  The rule also includes heightened standards for financial institutions with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets that requires at least 50 percent of incentive based payments for designated executives to be deferred for a minimum of three years. The interagency rule must be approved by all of the five federal members of the FFIEC, the SEC and the Federal Housing Finance Agency before comments on the rule are sought. Comments on the proposed interagency rule were due to the agencies by May 31, 2011. A definitive final rule has not been issued.
 Regulation Z was amended in 2011 to restrict incentive compensation programs with regard to residential mortgage programs. Such limitations affect mortgage brokers as well as loan officers in the subsidiary banks.

Compensation may be tied to volume, but not to terms or conditions of the transaction other than the amount of credit extended. Further amendments to Regulation Z relating to mortgage loan originator compensation were adopted on January 20, 2013, by the CFPB in accordance with the Dodd‑Frank Act.
 The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect our ability to hire, retain and motivate our key employees.
 Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives
 From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could have a material effect on our business, including increasing our cost of doing business, affecting our compensation structure, or limiting or expanding permissible activities. We cannot predict whether any such changes will be adopted and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that potential legislation, if enacted, or implementing regulations with respect thereto, would have upon our financial condition or results of our operations. The same uncertainty exists with respect to regulations authorized or required under the Dodd‑Frank Act, but that have not yet been proposed or finalized. There is also the possibility that the Dodd‑Frank Act or other federal laws may be revised by Congress in the future because certain bills have been introduced into Congress from time to time that would amend certain provisions of the Dodd‑Frank Act, or other federal legislation relating to financial institutions.  Similarly, it is possible that the legislatures of the State of Texas or the State of Oklahoma would amend applicable state laws relating to us or our Subsidiary Banks.
