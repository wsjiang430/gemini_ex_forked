We are committed to providing leading holographic technology services to our customers worldwide. Our holographic technology services include high-precision holographic light detection and ranging (“LiDAR”) solutions, based on holographic technology, exclusive holographic LiDAR point cloud algorithms architecture design, breakthrough technical holographic imaging solutions, holographic LiDAR sensor chip design and holographic vehicle intelligent vision technology to service customers that provide reliable holographic advanced driver assistance systems (“ADAS”). We also provide holographic digital twin technology services for customers and have built a proprietary holographic digital twin technology resource library. Our holographic digital twin technology resource library captures shapes and objects in 3D holographic form by utilizing a combination of our holographic digital twin software, digital content, spatial data-driven data science, holographic digital cloud algorithm, and holographic 3D capture technology. Our holographic digital twin technology and resource library have the potential to become the new norm for the digital twin augmented physical world in the near future. We are also a distributer of holographic hardware and generates revenue through resale.
 
We provide a broad range of holographic technology services in the holographic industry. Our holographic solutions and technology services are capable of meeting the complex and multi-faceted holographic technology needs of our customers.

Our holographic LiDAR solutions allow the automotive industry to break free from bulky mechanical rotating scanning systems and traditional sensors to solid-state LiDAR sensor with more components and smaller dimensions that can meet the demanding performance, safety, and cost requirements of our customers.
 
Our holographic ADAS provide a rich and safe set of autonomous control programs for vehicles. The point cloud algorithm for holographic LiDAR can detect and track obstacles, thereby avoiding and mitigating automotive collisions with both moving and static objects, including pedestrians and other vulnerable road obstacles and vehicles. By predicting and monitoring collision, our holographic LiDAR system calculates effective collusion mitigation plans by comparing the trajectory of an object with the trajectory of the moving vehicle to identify and avoid emergency situations while providing optimal comfort and safety to the driver. Due to the effectiveness, our holographic ADAS are being deployed at an increasing rate in the automotive industry.
 
As automakers and leading mobile and technology companies seek comprehensive digital perceptual solutions to accelerate and scale production for their autonomous driving programs, we believe that our holographic LiDAR can take advantage of this market trend to achieve excellent solutions for mass production of large-scale autonomous driving programs and vehicles.
 
Moreover, we are aligned to the rapid development of the Internet of Things, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (“AI”). Our holographic LiDAR solution is not only applicable to the field of intelligent vehicles but also applicable to robots, unmanned aerial vehicles (“UAVs”), advanced security systems, intelligent city development, industrial automation, environment, and mapping.
 
Our holographic digital twin technology resource library is built upon extensive holographic data modelling, simulation and bionics technology, culminating in a comprehensive holographic digital twin resource library which holographic developers and designers count on. Our digital twin resource library integrates holographic bionics and simulation digital models, as well as various holographic software technologies about holographic spatial positioning, dynamic capture, holographic image synthesis, which are open to all our users.

Our Services
 
We provide comprehensive, high-quality holographic technology services which include the following:
 
Holographic ADAS
 
Our holographic ADAS adopt self-developed holographic LiDAR module and vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (“VCSEL”) integrated circuit (“IC”) semiconductor, integrated with holographic onboard intelligent vision system and innovative design of automotive IC customization scheme, meanwhile embedded with self-developed holographic image and control software. Holographic ADAS mainly consist of three systems: (1) the environmental perception system responsible for environmental recognition, namely holographic LiDAR; (2) the central decision-making system responsible for computing and analysis, the core of which is the visual recognition technology based on computer graphics, where we integrate holographic image processing technology; and (3) the underlying execution system which is responsible for the execution control and the execution is mainly carried out by the hardware with functions of braking and steering.
 
Our holographic ADAS integrate holographic LiDAR front-view, surround-view, and internal-view cameras, which can monitor the environment inside and outside the vehicle in real-time. It can realize the functions of navigation, lane departure warning system, forward-collision warning system, blind-spot monitoring system, lane change assistance, automatic parking system, lane-keeping system, and driver state monitoring system. It can provide different technical options according to different customer needs.
 
Compared with traditional ADAS, the holographic ADAS we provide have obvious advantages such as better perceptual stability, lower costs, and higher precision. Currently, we are the direct supplier for certain automobile brands, as well as the secondary supplier of many automobile brands and the product supplier of rear-loading market. We believe we still has much growth space in the automobile ADAS field and autonomous driving field based on holographic LiDAR.
 

Holographic LiDAR Technology Applications
 
Our holographic ADAS adopt a “holographic LiDAR technology solution” in the vehicle sensing layer. There are several core advantages in our technical application: 3D model data model of ambient environment using point cloud data, high-precision and low-latency positioning, and obstacle detection and identification by classifications. In the process of assisting driving, the data obtained through the holographic LiDAR is combined with the high-precision map. After the point cloud data has completed locating the surrounding environment, real-time route guidance and rendering are carried out according to the position of the vehicle, and the sensor-based position estimation technology is optimized. By reading the vehicle sensor information and combining the human body motion model and other methods, the corresponding position is calculated and then used for decision-making in the real scene with the help of in-depth computing power analysis.
 
Our holographic LiDAR technology is significantly different from the traditional technology of space environment construction, mainly because of the following factors:

● | The VCSEL IC semiconductor application scheme developed by us is simpler in structure and is capable of improving resolution without increasing the size of the sensor or complexity as compared with light-emitting diode (“LED”) infrared light sources used by other 3D camera systems. Our VCSEL IC semiconductor application scheme is also smaller, consumes less power, and is more accurate in distance detection.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exclusive technology solution of holographic image algorithm. Multiple holographic LiDAR sensors with different specifications and performances are deployed around the vehicle, and the holographic road conditions around the vehicle can be sensed immediately when the system is started; it can not only avoid the forward collision, but also avoid the lateral and backward movement danger in time by obtaining more comprehensive spatial information.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exclusive design of LiDAR holographic point clouds algorithms architecture. Through the holographic technology, the perception algorithm software provides the operable data efficiently, realizes the line-by-line 3D scanning, improves the performance of holographic LiDAR efficiently, and obtains more efficient information feedback.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exclusive design of holographic LiDAR sensor chip. While maintaining the sensor advantage through advanced sensor development applications, with the self-developed holographic LiDAR module as the core of the sensing system, we can achieve the balance between high performance, real-time, gauge level stability and low cost, so as to improve the stability and reliability of the equipment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exclusive Technical Solution of Holographic Image Algorithm
 
Our holographic LiDAR combines holographic image processing technology, which enables ADAS to provide real-time, all-weather, and holographic perception of the surrounding environment. Holographic LiDAR gives us the following advantages:

● | Our holographic LiDAR has more efficient image processing ability and more accurate and rapid recognition ability, detects the surrounding environment with laser pulses, and combines with software to draw holograms, so as to provide enough environmental information for autonomous driving vehicles, and to perform static recognition of intelligent holographic vision and dynamic recognition of objects and signs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our holographic LiDAR has a high azimuth resolution, which means it is capable of distinguishing two or more objects aligned along the direction of measurement and can accurately detect the distance and positions of the surrounding obstacles. In addition to the surrounding vehicles and environment, it can also detect objects with low radio wave reflectivity, such as white lines, signs, and trees.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Our holographic LiDAR is capable of accurate and rapid recognition, which can improve the accuracy and quality of ADAS for the collection of information regarding the surrounding environment, so that vehicles can clearly process the road condition information, and provide safety warnings and other information, which can further promote the intelligent upgrading of the ADAS in the market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our holographic LiDAR can enhance the redundancy of the sensing system and supplement the missing scenes of millimeter-wave radar and camera. Holographic LiDAR has a long detection range, and its measurement accuracy is ten times higher than that of millimeter-wave radar. It can accurately depict the 3D shape of objects because millimeter-wave radar and ultrasonic radar are limited in accuracy and therefore cannot distinguish slow-moving people from other static objects. High precision and 3D modelling ability are the core advantages of holographic LiDAR over other sensors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exclusive Design of LiDAR Holographic Point Clouds Algorithms Architecture
 
Our holographic LiDAR adopts an exclusive holographic point cloud algorithm architecture, aiming at the efficient implementation of digital signal processing algorithms, enabling our holographic LiDAR to achieve excellent performance on all detectable targets.
 
Our algorithm design scheme for holographic LiDAR is capable of extensively developing and verifying the results of real-world road data, including road types, geographic and environmental conditions, etc. The proprietary algorithm architecture of our holographic LiDAR has the following advantages:
 

● | Exclusive algorithm architecture can enable the car sensing software to call the holographic LiDAR point cloud data in real-time.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The custom-developed optimization detection algorithm can enable the holographic LiDAR to achieve long-distance detection.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The exclusive detection algorithm can realize high-density detection at low speed and accelerate the computational-intensive processing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accurate distance and speed measurements can be made throughout the entire field of view.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | High confidence detection and reliable point cloud data can be achieved to ensure a low false alarm rate.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LiDAR technology can generate millions of to tens of millions of point clouds per second, while unprocessed point clouds are disordered and lack color and texture information, which is impractical for application. Our holographic LiDAR algorithm can denoise, simplify, calculate in key points, align, position, identify, and extract point cloud, and conduct accurate digital holographic three-dimensional reconstruction.
 
We believe that the digital signal processing algorithm in our holographic LiDAR technology can achieve the goal of high performance and low power consumption. The solution can operate in a variety of environmental conditions and meet the strict requirements of automotive safety and production safety.
 
Proprietary Holography LiDAR Sensor Chip Design
 
Our proprietary holographic LiDAR sensor chip design solves key hurdles to the wide adoption of automotive LiDAR based on traditional laser scanning technology.
 

● | Low power consumption: Low power consumption and small size can be applied to all types of vehicles, with the potential to promote mass-market adoption.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No interference: By carrying a unique feature for each beam, our holographic LiDAR can block any power source without a unique feature, so that it is not interfered with by other LiDAR and sunlight.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | High sensitivity: Holographic LiDAR is high in sensitivity and low in energy consumption.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | High dynamic range: When measuring highly reflective objects such as traffic signs on the road, holographic LiDAR is not easily affected by the noise observed with traditional techniques.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Higher sensitivity in severe weather: Holographic LiDAR provides better performance during bad weather by using continuous transmission of laser beam instead of short pulse in traditional LiDAR, and adapts to complex environment such as rain, snow, fog, dust, strong light, low illumination, etc.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Instantaneous measurement of speed: Holographic LiDAR can directly measure the instantaneous velocity of each pixel by measuring the Doppler effect caused by the dynamic motion of the object.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Laser safety: Because of the low power continuous beam, holographic LiDAR has better laser safety than the traditional LiDAR method which needs high power laser pulse.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the field of LiDAR, we believe that there is little room for image simulation technology to improve in the future. In contrast, we expect that our holographic LiDAR will grow exponentially in the next few years.
 
The application prospect of holographic LiDAR is very broad. Currently, it can be applied to autonomous driving and advanced driving assistance, etc. With the development of 5G and AI technology, our technology may gradually popularize robots, UAVs, advanced security systems, smart cities, industrial automation, environment and surveying and mapping and other industries in the future.
 
Holographic Vehicle Intelligent Vision
 
In the holographic ADAS, we provide users with better on-board intelligent visual experience. The holographic vehicle intelligent vision system, equipped with advanced sensors, controllers, actuators, communication modules and other equipment, can assist the driver in controlling the vehicle more conveniently through the holographic panoramic real-time navigation system, holographic look around system and holographic monitoring system. Our holographic ADAS can realize the following functions in the vehicle intelligent vision system:

● | Holographic panoramic real-time navigation system, which takes advantage of holographic LiDAR to create colorful real-time virtual objects by using the maximum field of vision when collecting the surrounding environment. The system realizes the special functions of holographic stereo and real-time dynamic centimeter-level navigation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Holographic look around system, including 3D look around as part of the autonomous visualization system (“AVS”), night vision system (“NVS”), panoramic look around system.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The advantage of holographic look around system is to project the four images collected by holographic LiDAR and other sensors onto a three-dimensional display model and enable the view roaming switch with the help of graphics processing units (“GPUs”) to avoid the virtual edge. The holographic look around system can bring the driver more visual field and more viewing angle. Through the holographic LiDAR technology, we reconstruct the scene around the vehicle in 3D and combine it with the virtual vehicle model in the same 3D coordination system by algorithm so as to construct a holographic vehicle intelligent vision system that is closer to the real world and provide accurate scene presentation for the driver to observe the environment.
 
The application of holographic vehicle intelligent vision enables the driver to have overall control over the surrounding environment of the car, which can not only effectively prevent the occurrence of reverse rolling accidents, but also avoid the possible events such as scraping bumper and wheel hub. In addition, for the information collected in real-time, the holographic look around system can recognize the object and send out early warning through the deep learning algorithm to assist the driver to drive safely.
 

● | Holographic monitoring system, including driver monitoring system (“DMS”), lane departure warning system (“LDWS”), and front vehicle collision warning system (“FCWS”).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We use the advanced patent technology in face recognition, combined with the holographic image acquisition technology. We have developed the advanced DMS for driver fatigue driving, which collects driver video through image sensor and then uses the algorithm to identify and locate the driver’s face and eyes. Through the analysis of the eye image features, the warning is issued. Our technology overcomes the defects of traditional recognition methods based on machine vision, which are easily interfered by glasses / sunglasses and other objects, improves the accuracy of driver’s eye closure judgment, and further improves the accuracy of fatigue driving judgment with better adaptability. In addition to early warning driving safety, this function can also be used to protect the property safety and payment safety of vehicles. When the system identifies an unregistered suspicious person on board, it can trigger an alarm in the cloud and synchronize the suspicious person’s face information to the cloud.
 
In addition, our LDWS, by telling the driving direction of the vehicle and the continuation direction of the traffic line, will issue a warning when the vehicle deviates from the lane line and the driving direction crosses the traffic lines on both sides. Our FCWS analyzes the shadow and contour features of vehicles in front of the road in real-time to locate the position of vehicles, and then calculates the estimated collision time according to the speed of the vehicle and the distance from the front vehicle, so as to determine the potential collision risk and issue an early warning.
 

With the increasing demand for autonomous driving, the demand for the application of holographic LiDAR in ADAS also increases. We understand that the most effective autopilot solution is perceptive and visual, and can provide the end consumers with complete solutions through the original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”). In order to ensure the highest efficiency of products, we cooperate with automotive IC manufacturers, which can not only achieve customized solutions but also provide customers with universal solutions.
 
We make use of holographic LiDAR in our products in a wide range of driving environments to enhance the perception capability and carry out intelligent holographic image recognition for the surrounding environment such as passing vehicles, pedestrians, lane lines, traffic signs, traffic lights, etc., so as to provide drivers with a series of driving safety assistance, such as front vehicle distance monitoring, collision warning, pedestrian warning, lane departure warning, front vehicle start warning, traffic light reminder, etc. Our product portfolio of holographic ADAS includes sensor hardware and perception and decision-making software to improve existing vehicle capabilities and achieve a higher level of vehicle automation for consumer and commercial applications.

Holographic Digital Technology
 
Holography refers to the expression of all information of things. The advantage of holography lies in the expression of holographic space. It is another carrier of information in society. Holographic display technology is different from other traditional 3D display technologies in that it does not rely on any external devices like 3D glasses and helmets. Comparatively speaking, holographic display technology has the advantages of unlimited viewing angle, omni-directional viewing and no difference from the real object, and it can also interact with holographic imaging in-depth, which is a new breakthrough in touch sensing interaction and meets the goal of natural reality and three-dimensional visual effect.
 
Holographic digital technology is the combination of computer technology, holographic technology, and electronic imaging technology. It records holograms through electronic components and realizes real-time image processing. At the same time, the digital image can be quantitatively analyzed by computer, the intensity and phase distribution of the image can be obtained by calculation, and the superposition of multiple holograms can be simulated, so that the recording and reproduction of holograms can be truly digitized.
 

As communication technology enters the 5G era, the rapid development and popularization of cloud computing, big data, AI, and other technologies have promoted the development of holographic digital technology. we believe that holographic digital technology will become the technical foundation of the next generation of the Internet. We believe that the next generation of Internet will be holographic space Internet and hopes that through our continuous attempts and breakthroughs in holographic technology, we can lay a foundation for wide adoption by the mass market.
 
We believe that the combination of holographic technology and digitization is of great significance in promoting the development of social economy and culture. With the development of technology, the application of holographic digital technology is becoming more market oriented. For example, in the automotive field, the holographic digital technology is applied to the navigation, and the navigation is projected on the front window, so that the driver can clearly know the route without bending his head, which greatly improves the driving safety. The application in the medical field is also of great practical significance. The use of holographic digital technology can record the vibration and deformation of organs in the human body in a three-dimensional way, which can be measured by the interference fringes on the hologram. The second exposure technology of holographic LiDAR can also analyze the changes of human organs, so as to find out the location and size of lesions. For example, the use of holographic digital technology can detect the location of malignant tumors and contribute to the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Because of the non-destructive property of digital hologram, it is considered to be the best method to detect human internal organs. Of course, digital hologram technology is also widely used in clinical examination. In addition, in the field of aerospace, holographic digital technology also has broad application prospects, such as the use of holographic digital technology can simulate the real outer space for real perception training, which brings great significance to the training of astronauts.
 
With the continuous expansion of the application field of holographic digital technology, we believe that in the future, holographic digital technology will become an irreplaceable part of society.

Holographic LiDAR Technology
 
LiDAR is a combination of laser, global positioning system (“GPS”) and inertial navigation system (“INS”) technology and is used to obtain point cloud data and generate accurate digital three-dimensional model. Laser itself has a very accurate ranging capability and its ranging accuracy can reach several centimeters. In addition to the laser itself, the accuracy of LiDAR system also depends on the synchronization of laser, GPS, and inertial measurement unit (“IMU”). Holographic LiDAR is an active measurement device that detects the precise distance between the object and the sensor by emitting a laser beam, including a transmitting unit, a receiving unit, a scanning unit and a data processing unit. The distance is determined by measuring the time difference and phase difference of the laser signal, and the angle is measured by horizontal scanning. According to these two parameters, a two-dimensional polar coordinate system is established, and then the three-dimensional height information is obtained by different pitch angle signals.
 
With the development of commercial GPS and IMU, it has been widely used to obtain high-precision data from mobile platforms (such as automobiles) through LiDAR. LiDAR scanning can obtain point cloud data, which can be used to create 3D computer-aided design (“CAD”) models for manufacturing parts, quality inspection, diversified vision, cartoon production, 3D drawing, and mass communication tool applications. In addition, it can be used in the construction of digital 3D City, 3D terrain acquisition, 3D cultural relic reconstruction, cadastral survey, power inventory and other industries that need surveying and mapping modelling.
 
Holographic Intelligent Vision Technology
 
Holographic intelligent vision refers to the machine vision that uses camera and computer to simulate human vision to recognize, track and measure the target, and to further process the image through recognition and analysis, so that the computer processing becomes more suitable for human eyes to observe or transmit to the instrument for detection. Holographic intelligent vision plays an important role in the establishment of artificial intelligence system to obtain “information” from images or multidimensional data.
 
Holographic intelligent vision is the science of using computers to imitate human visual systems, which enables computer with the ability to extract, process, understand and analyze images and image sequences similar to human beings, and realize the perception and recognition of the three-dimensional scene of the objective world.
 
In the fields of autopilot, robot, intelligent medical and so on, it is necessary to extract information from the visual signal by holographic intelligent vision technology and carry out high-precision processing. Holographic intelligent vision technology used in holographic technology service includes holographic face recognition, holographic object, and scene recognition.

Holographic SDK Technology
 
Holographic SDK technology can collect holographic data through tactile feedback information, force feedback information and the movement of the observed object. The holographic virtual space is constructed by scene map switching, scene building and 3D geographic information; Holographic digital content editing is carried out by means of dynamic image processing, graphic display, and rectification. Through the control system of animation glare system, dynamic glare effect and dynamic conversion, the holographic digital effect is produced, and the holographic virtual digital control function is realized by light field dynamic fusion control system and holographic digital display software.
 
Our holographic SDK services include holographic data acquisition, holographic virtual space construction, holographic digital content editing, holographic digital effect production and holographic virtual digital control module, and 65 software kits, which can meet the current market demand for holographic software technology application, software development and other aspects. We will also continue to develop new functions according to the needs of customers to enrich the holographic SDK library.

Applicable Government Regulations
 
Laws and Regulations Relating to Foreign Investment
 
According to the Provisions on Guiding the Direction of Foreign Investment, which took effect on April 1, 2002, industries in the PRC are classified into four categories: “permitted foreign investment industries”, “encouraged foreign investment industries”, “restricted foreign investment industries” and “prohibited foreign investment industries”. “Encouraged foreign investment industries”, “restricted foreign investment industries” and “prohibited foreign investment industries” are stipulated in the Catalog. Industries which do not fall in any of these three categories are regarded as “permitted foreign investment industries”. The Catalog is promulgated and is amended by the NDRC and the MOFCOM. The Negative List, which was last amended on June 23, 2020 and subsequently enforced on July 23, 2020 by the NDRC and the MOFCOM and replace the Catalog, sets forth management measures for the market entry of foreign investors, such as equity requirements and senior manager requirements. According to the Negative List, any internet cultural activities (except for the provision of music) is a foreign investment prohibited industry, and foreign-invested shares of value-added telecommunications services must not exceed 50% (excluding e-commerce, domestic multi-party communications services, store and forward services and call center services) of the business.
 
An enterprise which establishes, operates and manages within the Chinese territory is subject to the PRC Company Law last amended on October 26, 2018. The PRC Company Law is also applicable to a foreign investment company. Nevertheless, where there are other special laws relating to foreign investment, such laws shall prevail.
 
The procedures for the establishment of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, the verification, registration and approval procedures, registered capital requirements, foreign exchange restrictions, accounting practices, taxation and labor matters are subject to the Law on Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprises of the PRC, which was last amended on September 3, 2016 and subsequently enforced on October 1, 2016 and the Implementation Regulations for Law on Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprises of the PRC, which was last amended on February 19, 2014 and subsequently enforced on March 1, 2014 and Provisional Administration Measures for the Registration of the Formation and Changes of Foreign Invested Enterprises (the “Measures”) which was last amended on June 29, 2018 and subsequently enforced on June 30, 2018.
 
According to the Measures, where the incorporation of foreign-invested enterprises does not fall within the scope of the Negative List, such enterprises shall file and submit the record-filing information on the incorporation of foreign-invested enterprises simultaneously when they go through the registration procedures for incorporation. Within the record-filing scope of the Measures, in the case of a change of basic information of the foreign-invested enterprises or their investors, a change of equity (shares) or cooperation interest of the foreign-invested enterprises, merger, division or dissolution, mortgage or transfer of foreign invested enterprise’s property or rights and interests to others and other matters, the foreign-invested enterprise shall file the relevant documents online within 30 days upon occurrence of such changes via the comprehensive administrative system.
 
18

 

On December 30, 2019, the MOC and the State Administration of Market Regulation issued the Measures for the Reporting of Foreign Investment Information, which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and replaced the Measures. Since January 1, 2020, for foreign investors carrying out investment activities directly or indirectly in China, the foreign investors or foreign-invested enterprises shall submit investment information to the commerce authorities pursuant to these measures.
 
On March 15, 2019, the NPC approved the Foreign Investment Law, which became effective on January 1, 2020, and replaced the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprises Law. On December 26, 2019, the State Council issued the Regulations on Implementing the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, and replaced the Regulations on Implementing the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, Provisional Regulations on the Duration of Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Regulations on Implementing the Wholly Foreign-Invested Enterprise Law, and the Regulations on Implementing the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law.
 
Under the Foreign Investment Law, the State shall implement the management systems of pre-establishment national treatment and negative list for foreign investment, according to which the treatment given to foreign investors and their investments during the investment access stage shall be not lower than that given to their domestic counterparts, and the State shall give national treatment to foreign investment beyond the negative list where special administrative measures for the access of foreign investment in specific fields is specified. Besides, the State shall protect foreign investors’ investment, earnings and other legitimate rights and interests within the territory of China in accordance with the law. The state will take measures to prompt foreign investment such as ensuring fair competition for foreign-invested enterprises to participate in government procurement activities, and protection of intellectual property rights of foreign investors and foreign-invested enterprises.
 
Industry Catalog Relating to Foreign Investment
 
Industries listed in the Catalog are divided into three categories: encouraged, restricted and prohibited. Industries not listed in the Catalog are generally deemed as constituting a fourth “permitted” category. Establishment of wholly foreign-owned enterprises is generally allowed in encouraged and permitted industries. Some restricted industries are limited to equity or contractual joint ventures, while in some cases Chinese partners are required to hold the majority interests in such joint ventures. In addition, restricted category projects are subject to higher-level government approvals. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category. Industries not listed in the Catalog are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations.
 
On March 15, 2019, the National People’s Congress adopted the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, which became effective on January 1, 2020 and replaced three existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the Wholly Foreign-Invested Enterprise Law of the PRC, the Sino-Foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law of the PRC and the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law of the PRC, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. On December 26, 2019, the State Council issued the Regulations on Implementing the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, and replaced the Regulations on Implementing the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law of the PRC, Provisional Regulations on the Duration of Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Regulations on Implementing the Wholly Foreign-Invested Enterprise Law of the PRC, and the Regulations on Implementing the Sino-Foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law of the PRC. The Foreign Investment Law of the PRC embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic investments. However, since it is relatively new, uncertainties still exist in relation to its interpretation and implementation. For example, the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC adds a catch-all clause to the definition of “foreign investment” so that foreign investment, by its definition, includes “investments made by foreign investors in China through other means defined by other laws or administrative regulations or provisions promulgated by the State Council” without further elaboration on the meaning of “other means.”
 
On June 30, 2019, the MOFCOM and the NDRC promulgated the Special Management Measures (Negative List) for the Access of Foreign Investment, or the Negative List, which took effective from July 30, 2019. The Negative List expands the scope of industries in which foreign investment is permitted by reducing the number of industries that fall within the Negative List. Foreign investment in value-added telecommunications services (other than e-commerce, domestic multi-party communications, store-and-forward and call center), including internet data center services, still falls within the Negative List.
 
19

 

On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the MOFCOM, the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, or the SASAC, the State Administration of Taxation, or the SAT, the SAIC, the CSRC, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or the SAFE jointly adopted the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, which came into effect on September 8, 2006 and were amended on June 22, 2009. The M&A Rules include, among other things, provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle formed for the purpose of an overseas listing of securities in a PRC company obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle’s securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website procedures regarding its approval of overseas listings by special purpose vehicles. However, substantial uncertainty remains regarding the scope and applicability of the M&A Rules to offshore special purpose vehicles.
 
Our PRC subsidiaries are mainly engaged in providing technical services, which fall into the “encouraged” or “permitted” category under the Catalog. Our PRC subsidiaries have obtained all material approvals required for our business operations. Specifically, Our PRC subsidiaries engaged in holographic advertising business mainly provide holographic technical services to customers in the advertising industry. According to the Regulations of the People’s Republic of China on Telecommunications promulgated by the State Council of the People’s Republic of China on February 6, 2016 (the “Regulations”), “value-added telecommunications services” refers to the provision of additional telecommunications and information services by using public network infrastructure. In addition, the Classification Catalogue of Telecommunications Services (the “Classification”) annexed to the Regulations provides a list of telecommunications services that fall within the definition of “value-added telecommunications services.” Our holographic advertising service does not use public network infrastructure to provide additional services and is not within the list provided by the Classification, and accordingly does not fall into the category of “value-added telecommunications services” as governed by the Regulations.
 
Anti-money Laundering Regulations
 
The PRC Anti-money Laundering Law, which was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress in October 2006 and became effective in January 2007, sets forth the principal anti-money laundering requirements applicable to financial institutions as well as non-financial institutions with anti-money laundering obligations, including the adoption of precautionary and supervisory measures, establishment of various systems for client identification, retention of clients’ identification information and transactions records, and reports on large transactions and suspicious transactions. According to the PRC Anti-money Laundering Law, conducts of money-laundering includes dissimulating, concealing through various means the source and nature of gains and profits from drug offences, organized gangsterdom crime, terrorist activities, smuggling, corruption and bribery, disruption of financial order, and financial fraud. Financial institutions subject to the PRC Anti-money Laundering Law include duly established policy banks, commercial banks, credit unions, postal saving organizations, trust investment companies, securities companies, futures brokerage companies, insurance companies and other institutions engaging in financial business as determined and published by the competent anti-money laundering administrative authorities of the State Council, while the list of the non-financial institutions with anti-money laundering obligations will be published by the State Council. The PBOC and other governmental authorities issued a series of administrative rules and regulations to specify the anti-money laundering obligations of financial institutions and certain non-financial institutions, such as payment institutions.
 
The Guidelines jointly released by ten PRC regulatory agencies in July 2015, purport, among other things, to require internet financial service providers, including online lending information intermediaries, to comply with certain anti-money laundering requirements, including the establishment of a customer identification program, the monitoring and reporting of suspicious transactions, the preservation of customer information and transaction records, and the provision of assistance to the public security department and judicial authority in investigations and proceedings in relation to anti-money laundering matters. The Interim Measures jointly issued by four PRC regulatory agencies in August 2016 require the online lending information intermediaries, among other things, to comply with certain anti-money laundering obligations, including verifying customer identification, reporting suspicious transactions and preserving customer information and transaction records. The Custodian Guidelines issued by PBOC in February 2017 require the online lending platforms to set up custody accounts with commercial banks and comply with the anti-money laundry requirements of the relevant commercial banks.
 
In cooperation with our partnering custody banks and payment companies, we have adopted various policies and procedures for anti-money laundering purposes.

Regulations Relating to Overseas Listings
 
In August 2006, six PRC regulatory authorities, including the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, jointly adopted the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, amended in June 2009. The M&A Rules, among other things, require that if an overseas company established or controlled by PRC companies or individuals, or PRC Citizens, intends to acquire equity interests or assets of any other PRC domestic company affiliated with the PRC Citizens, such acquisition must be submitted to the MOFCOM for approval. The M&A Rules also require that an Overseas SPV formed for overseas listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by the PRC Citizens shall obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to overseas listing and trading of such Overseas SPV’s securities on an overseas stock exchange.
 
On February 17, 2023, the CSRC issued the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, or the Trial Measures, which will become effective on March 31, 2023. On the same date of the issuance of the Trial Measures, the CSRC circulated No.1 to No.5 Supporting Guidance Rules, the Notes on the Trial Measures, the Notice on Administration Arrangements for the Filing of Overseas Listings by Domestic Enterprises and the relevant CSRC Answers to Reporter Questions on the official website of the CSRC, or collectively, the Guidance Rules and Notice. The Trial Measures, together with the Guidance Rules and Notice, reiterate the basic supervision principles as reflected in the Draft Overseas Listing Regulations by providing substantially the same requirements for filings of overseas offerings and listings by domestic companies, yet made the following updates compared to the Draft Overseas Listing Regulations: (a) further clarification of the circumstances prohibiting overseas issuances and listings; (b) further clarification of the standard of indirect overseas listings under the principle of substance over form, and (c) adding more details of filing procedures and requirements by setting different filing requirements for different types of overseas offerings and listings. Under the Trial Measures and the Guidance Rules and Notice, domestic companies conducting overseas securities offering and listing activities, either in direct or indirect form, shall complete filing procedures with the CSRC pursuant to the requirements of the Trial Measures within three working days following the submission of initial public offering or listing applications.
 
Based on our understanding of the current PRC laws and regulations, we reasonably believe that we currently are not be required to submit an application to the CSRC for the approval of our listing and trading on the Nasdaq. However, there are substantial uncertainties as to how the M&A Rules will be interpreted or implemented in the context of an overseas offering, and its opinions summarized above are subject to any new laws, rules and regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations in any form relating to the M&A Rules.
 
Laws and Regulations Relating to Marketing Business
 
The Advertising Law of the PRC (the “Advertising Law”), which took effect on February 1, 1995 and was last amended on October 26, 2018, regulates contents of advertisements, codes of conduct for advertisers, and the supervision and administration of the advertising industry. It also stipulates that advertisers, advertising operators, and advertisement publishers shall abide by the Advertising Law and other laws and regulations, be honest and trustworthy, and compete in a fair manner in advertising business.
 
According to the Advertising Law, if advertising operators know or should have known the content of the advertisements is false or deceptive but still provide advertising design, production and agency services in connection with the advertisement, they might be subject to penalties, including confiscation of revenue and fines, and the competent PRC authority may suspend or revoke their business licenses.
 
The Interim Measures for the Administration of Internet Advertising (the “Interim Measures on Internet Advertising”), which took effect on September 1, 2016, regulate advertising activities conducted via the internet. According to the Interim Measures on Internet Advertising, advertisements published or distributed via the internet shall not interfere with users’ normal use of the internet. For example, advertisements published on web page pop-up windows or in others forms shall be clearly marked with a “close” sign to ensure a “Click to close”. No entity or individual may induce users to click on the contents of an advertisement through deception. An internet advertisement publisher or advertising operator shall establish and maintain an acceptable registration, examination and file management system for its advertisers; examine, verify and record the identity information of each advertiser. The Interim Measures on Internet Advertising also require internet advertisement publishers and advertising operators to verify related supporting documents, check the contents of the advertisement and prohibits them from designing, producing, providing services or publishing any advertisement if the content and supporting documents do not match each other or the documentary evidence thereof are insufficient.
 
Laws and Regulations Relating to Information Security and Privacy Protection
 
Internet content in the PRC is regulated and restricted from a state security standpoint. The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (the “SCNPC”) enacted the Decisions on the Maintenance of Internet Security, which took effect on December 28, 2000 and was last amended on August 27, 2009, to subject persons to criminal liabilities in the PRC for any attempt to (i) gain improper entry to a computer or system of strategic importance; (ii) disseminate politically disruptive information; (iii) leak state secrets; (iv) spread false commercial information; or (v) infringe intellectual property rights. The Administration Measures on the Security Protection of Computer Information Network with International Connections, which took effect on December 30, 1997 and was last amended on January 8, 2011, prohibit using the internet in ways which, among others, result in a leakage of state secrets or a spread of socially destabilizing content. The Provisions on the Technical Measures for the Protection of the Security of the Internet, which was promulgated by the MPS and took effect on March 1, 2006, require internet service providers to take proper measures including anti-virus, data back-up and other related measures, to keep records of certain information about its users (including users registration information, log-in and log-out time, IP address, content and time of posts by users) for at least 60 days, and to detect illegal information, stop transmission of such information, and keep relevant records. If an internet information service provider violates these measures, the MPS and the local security bureaus may revoke its operating license and shut down its website. In accordance with the Circular of the Ministry of Public Security, the State Secrecy Bureau, the State Cipher Code Administration and The Information Office of the State Council on Printing and Distributing the Administrative Measures for the Graded Protection of Information Security which took effect on June 22, 2007, the security protection grade of an information system may be classified into the five grades. To newly build an information system of Grade II or above, its operator or user shall, within 30 days after it is put into operation, handle the record-filing procedures at the local public security organ at the level of municipality divided into districts or above of its locality.
