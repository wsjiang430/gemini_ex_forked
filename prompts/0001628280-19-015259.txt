ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General 
ABM Industries Incorporated, which operates through its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “ABM,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”), is a leading provider of integrated facility solutions with a mission to make a difference, every person, every day. Our history dates back to 1909, when American Building Maintenance Company began as a window washing company in San Francisco with one employee. In 1985, we were incorporated in Delaware under the name American Building Maintenance Industries, Inc., as the successor to the business originally founded in 1909. In 1994, we changed our name to ABM Industries Incorporated. Over the past twelve years, we have grown into a multi-segment facility solutions company, primarily through strategic acquisitions and new service offerings, increasing our revenue from $3 billion to more than $6 billion.
The acquisition of OneSource in 2007 bolstered ABM as a leader in the janitorial market, while the Linc Group acquisition in 2010 established ABM as a “facility solutions” company with new service offerings, including lighting, mechanical, and electrical “technical solutions.” With demand increasing for industry-specific service providers, in 2012 we purchased Air Serv and established our first industry group, “aviation.” In recent years, we have strategically acquired companies in the United Kingdom, particularly with the GBM and Westway acquisitions, which expanded our janitorial and technical solutions businesses overseas. In 2017, we acquired GCA Services Group (“GCA”), a provider of integrated facility services to educational institutions and commercial facilities, for approximately $1.3 billion, the largest acquisition in ABM history. As a result of this acquisition, we are now a leading facility solutions provider in the education market. In recent years, we also evaluated all of our service offerings and sold our Security and Government Services businesses, which did not align with our long-term focus on industry groups.
Additionally, in 2015 we began a comprehensive transformational initiative (“2020 Vision”) to drive long-term, profitable growth through an industry-based go-to-market approach. As part of this initiative, we centralized key functional areas, strengthened our sales capabilities, and initiated investments in service delivery tools and processes to help support standard operating practices that we believe are foundational to our long-term success. 
As a result of these strategic changes, we have strengthened our ability to offer Janitorial, Parking, Facilities Services, Building & Energy Solutions, and Airline Services, on a standalone basis or in combination, and positioned ourselves as a leading integrated facilities management company.
Unless otherwise indicated, all references to years are to our fiscal year, which ends on October 31.
Contract Types
We generate revenues under several types of contracts, as explained below. Generally, the type of contract is determined by the nature of the services. Although many of our service agreements are cancelable on short notice, we have historically had a high rate of client retention and expect to continue maintaining long-term relationships with our clients. See Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the contract types that are most common in each of our service lines. 

Contract Type | Description 
Monthly Fixed-Price | These arrangements are contracts in which the client agrees to pay a fixed fee every month over a specified contract term. 
Square-Foot | Monthly square-foot arrangements are contracts in which the client agrees to pay a fixed fee every month based on the actual square footage serviced over a specified contract term. 
Cost-Plus | These arrangements are contracts in which the clients reimburse us for the agreed-upon amount of wages and benefits, payroll taxes, insurance charges, and other expenses associated with the contracted work, plus a profit margin. 
Tag Services | Tag services (work orders) generally consist of supplemental services requested by clients outside of the standard service specification and includes cleanup after tenant moves, construction cleanup, flood cleanup, and snow removal. 
Transaction-Price | These are arrangements in which customers are billed a fixed price for each transaction performed on a monthly basis (e.g., wheelchair passengers served or airplane cabins cleaned). 
Hourly | In hourly arrangements, the client is billed a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour provided. 
Management Reimbursement | Under these parking arrangements, we manage a parking facility for a management fee and pass through the revenue and expenses associated with the facility to the owner. 
Leased Location | Under these parking arrangements, we pay a fixed amount of rent plus a percentage of revenues derived from monthly and transient parkers to the property owner. We retain all revenues received and are responsible for most operating expenses incurred.
Allowance | Under these parking arrangements, we are paid a fixed amount or hourly fee to provide parking services, and we are responsible for certain operating expenses, as specified in the contract. 
Energy Savings Contracts and Fixed-Price Repair and Refurbishment | Under these arrangements, we agree to develop, design, engineer, and construct a project. Additionally, as part of bundled energy solutions arrangements, we guarantee the project will satisfy agreed-upon performance standards. 
Franchise | We franchise certain engineering services through individual and area franchises under the Linc Service and TEGG brands, which are part of ABM Technical Solutions. 

Segment and Geographic Financial Information
Our current reportable segments consist of Business & Industry (“B&I”), Aviation, Technology & Manufacturing (“T&M”), Education, and Technical Solutions. Refer to Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the modification in our presentation of inter-segment revenues and the reorganization of our Healthcare business into our other industry groups, primarily B&I, during 2019. For segment and geographic financial information, see Note 19, “Segment and Geographic Information,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND DESCRIPTIONS
 | B&I, our largest reportable segment, encompasses janitorial, facilities engineering, and parking services for commercial real estate properties, sports and entertainment venues, and traditional hospitals and non-acute healthcare facilities. B&I also provides vehicle maintenance and other services to rental car providers. We typically provide services in this segment pursuant to monthly fixed-price, square-foot, cost-plus, and parking arrangements (i.e., management reimbursement, leased location, or allowance) that are obtained through a competitive bid process as well as pursuant to tag services.
 | Aviation supports airlines and airports with services ranging from parking and janitorial to passenger assistance, catering logistics, air cabin maintenance, and transportation. We typically provide services to clients in this segment under master services agreements. These agreements are typically re-bid upon renewal and are generally structured as monthly fixed-price, square-foot, cost-plus, parking, transaction-price, and hourly arrangements. Two clients accounted for approximately 27% of revenues for this segment in 2019. 
 | T&M provides janitorial, facilities engineering, and parking services to industrial and high-tech manufacturing facilities. We typically provide these services pursuant to monthly fixed-price, square-foot, cost-plus, and parking arrangements that are obtained through a competitive bid process as well as pursuant to tag services. 
 | Education delivers janitorial, custodial, landscaping and grounds, facilities engineering, and parking services for public school districts, private schools, colleges, and universities. These services are typically provided pursuant to monthly fixed-price, square-foot, and cost-plus arrangements that are obtained through either a competitive bid process or re-bid upon renewal as well as pursuant to tag services. 
 | Technical Solutions specializes in mechanical and electrical services. These services can also be leveraged for cross-selling across all of our industry groups, both domestically and internationally. Contracts for this segment are generally structured as energy savings and fixed-price repair and refurbishment contracts and franchise arrangements. 

Service Marks, Trademarks, and Trade Names
We hold various service marks, trademarks, and trade names, such as “ABM,” “ABM Building Value,” “ABM Greencare,” “Linc Service,” “MPower,” “OmniServ,” and “TEGG,” which we deem important to our marketing activities, to our business, and, in some cases, to the franchising activities conducted by our Technical Solutions segment.
Dependence on Significant Client
No client accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues during 2019, 2018, or 2017.
Competition
We believe that each aspect of our business is highly competitive and that such competition is based primarily on price, quality of service, efficiency enhancements, adapting to changing workplace conditions, and ability to anticipate and respond to industry changes. A majority of our revenue is derived from projects requiring competitive bids; however, an invitation to bid is often conditioned upon prior experience, industry expertise, and financial strength. The low cost of entry in the facility services business results in a very competitive market. We mainly compete with regional and local owner-operated companies that may have more acute vision into local markets and significantly lower labor and overhead costs, providing them with competitive advantages in those regards. We also compete indirectly with companies that can perform for themselves one or more of the services we provide. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing activities include digital engagement and direct interactions with prospective and existing clients, pricing, proposal management, and customer relationship management by dedicated business development teams, operations personnel, and management. These activities are executed by branch and regional sales, marketing, and operations teams assigned to our industry groups and are supported by centralized sales support teams, inside sales teams, corporate marketing personnel, and our Center of Excellence teams. These sales and marketing teams acquire, nurture, and manage leads, as well as train personnel on sales tools and proposal systems, all governed by standard operating procedures. 
Regulatory Environment and Environmental Compliance
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, and/or local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, such as discharge into soil, water, and air, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and hazardous substances. From time to time we are involved in environmental matters at certain of our locations or in connection with our operations. Historically, the cost of complying with environmental laws or resolving environmental issues relating to locations or operations in the United States or abroad has not had a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability
As a company with more than 110 years’ experience, we understand the need to embed corporate responsibility into our business practices to create value and support the long-term success of our business, shareholders, clients, and team members. 
Our strategy has evolved over the years to align with our stakeholders’ expectations regarding environmental, social, and governance policies. Recently, we have established three strategic axes of our sustainability strategy based on the topics that are most material to our business: doing business in a responsible way and creating value for clients; improving our value chain continuously; and positively impacting the ecosystem. 
Since 2011, we have voluntarily published a Sustainability Report on an annual basis in alignment with the Global Reporting Initiative framework to address our business, our team members, and the environment. More information can be found in the corporate sustainability section of our corporate website. 
Employees
As of October 31, 2019, we employed approximately 140,000 persons, of which approximately 45,000, or 32%, were subject to various local collective bargaining agreements.
