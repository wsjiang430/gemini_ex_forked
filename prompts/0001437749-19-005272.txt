Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development of novel recombinant (synthetic) proteins. Our goal is to use our patented and licensed technologies to establish our company as a leader in the development and commercialization of novel recombinant proteins to treat kidney and neurological diseases. Our primary focus is on chronic kidney disease (“CKD”) and acute ischemic stroke (“AIS”). We plan to advance our lead drug candidate, DM199, through clinical trials, as appropriate, to create shareholder value by establishing its clinical and commercial potential as a therapy for CKD and AIS.
 
DM199 is a recombinant form of human tissue kallikrein-1 (“KLK1”). KLK1 is a serine protease (protein) produced in the pancreas, kidneys and salivary glands, which plays a critical role in the regulation of local blood flow and vasodilation (the widening of blood vessels which decreases blood pressure) in the body, as well as an important role in inflammation and oxidative stress (an imbalance between potentially damaging reactive oxygen species, or free radicals, and antioxidants in your body). We believe DM199 has the potential to treat a variety of diseases where healthy functioning requires sufficient activity of KLK1 and its system, the kallikrein-kinin system (“KKS”).
 
Our current product candidates in preclinical and clinical development are as follows:
 

KLK1 is involved in multiple biochemical processes. The most well-characterized activity of KLK1 is its enzymatic cleavage of low molecular weight kininogen (“LMWK”) to produce bradykinin (“BK”)-like peptides, collectively known as kinins, which activate BK receptors (BK1R, BK2R). Activation of BK receptors by kinins sets in motion metabolic pathways that can improve blood flow (through vasodilation), dampen inflammation, and protect tissues and end-organs from ischemic damage. Scientific literature, including publications in Circulation Research, Immunopharmacology and Kidney International, suggests that lower endogenous KLK1 levels in patients are associated with diseases related to vascular disorders, such as kidney diseases, stroke and hypertension. We believe DM199 could replenish KLK1 levels to properly activate the BK system that protects the kidney and brain from damage. By providing this additional supply of KLK1, DM199 treatment could improve blood flow to damaged end-organs, such as kidneys and brain, supporting the structural integrity and normal functioning.

DM199 (KLK1): Increasing Blood Flow in Brain and Kidneys
 

We believe DM199 may provide new treatment options with significant benefits over the current standards of care by offering potentially fewer side effects and a therapeutic treatment option to a greater number of patients. There are no approved therapies in the United States or the European Union, of which we are aware, to address low KLK1 levels. We are positioning DM199 for worldwide use. We have conducted and are conducting clinical trials in Europe and Australia to support regulatory filings in the United States, Europe and around the world; with an initial focus on the United States. In December 2018, the FDA accepted our Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) for the initiation of a Phase Ib clinical trial of DM199 in patients with moderate or severe CKD caused by Type I or Type II diabetes and in February 2019, we initiated dosing patients in this study. The results from this Phase Ib study will assist us in the design of upcoming Phase II studies in patients suffering from rare diseases and CKD. The DM199 drug levels from this Phase Ib study will also help determine the optimal dose levels for testing in the Phase II studies.

Lower KLK1 levels are associated with initial stroke events and are also a predictor of stroke recurrence after an initial stroke. As shown in the graph below, the red line represents patients in the lowest KLK1 quartile who are at the highest risk for recurrence of stroke. (2,478 stroke patients and event free survival over 5 years).
 

For patients suffering from kidney disease, studies have shown that KLK1 excretion, or levels of KLK1 in the urine, significantly decreased in patients with mild kidney disease and was further reduced in patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis as compared to healthy subjects, as illustrated in the graph below.
 
Low KLK1 Levels Associated With Kidney Disease
 

Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a leader in the discovery, development, and commercialization of recombinant proteins for the treatment of severe and life-threatening diseases. We seek to identify and select, for development and partnership, recombinant proteins with novel mechanisms that have biological properties with broad applicability. Once we have selected a class of recombinant proteins, we apply their biological properties to clinical settings with unmet needs, and we evaluate opportunities based on estimated development timelines and costs, regulatory pathway, and commercial opportunities. After identifying suitable molecules for clinical development, we intend to mitigate development risk by maintaining a diversified and broad clinical pipeline, analyzing data to determine the potential of each program and entering into development collaborations with industry-leading companies.

Targeted Indications and Markets for DM199
 
Chronic Kidney Disease
 
CKD is characterized by a progressive decline in overall kidney function as measured by glomerular filtration rate (“GFR”) (a test used to check how well the kidneys are filtering excess fluid and waste products out of your blood), and albuminuria (the amount of albumin protein excreted in your urine). When GFR gets too low, patients develop end stage renal disease (“ESRD”) and require dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. Among multiple underlying causes, CKD often begins with an increase in blood glucose, which leads to the thickening of the glomerular membrane, known as fibrosis. As the kidney function becomes impaired, GFR decreases and abnormal amounts of protein are released into the urine collecting tubules of the kidney through damaged capillary pores. Additionally, increased blood glucose leads to increased blood pressure, reactive oxygen species, advanced glycation end product formation (harmful compounds that are formed when protein or fat combine with sugar in the bloodstream) and inflammation. As this continues, structural components of the kidney (the nephron) begin to collapse, resulting in cell ischemia and cell death. As the renal damage continues, a progressive thickening of the basement membrane is seen along with continued pathological changes in the cell and inflammation. Early stages of CKD are characterized as microalbuminuria (small amounts of protein leak into the urine). Late stages are characterized as macroalbuminuria (large amount of protein in the urine). The rate of decline depends on the type of diabetes, genetic predisposition, glycemic controls, and blood pressure. At the final stages of CKD, the kidneys fail completely and dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed.
 
CKD is a widespread health problem that generates significant economic burden throughout the world, including:
 

● | 30 million Americans and 120 million Chinese suffer from this debilitating and potentially life-threatening condition according to the National Kidney Foundation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The primary causes of CKD are diabetes (Type 2 and Type 1) and hypertension. The Medical Clinics of North America estimates that over 40% of those with Type 2 diabetes and 20% of those with Type 1 diabetes will eventually develop CKD, making it one of the more common risks for diabetics.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patients with CKD are at greater risk for hypertension and heart disease.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Currently, there is no cure for CKD and treatment involves management of the disease. Blood pressure medications, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (“ACEi”) or angiotensin receptor blockers (“ARB”), are often prescribed to control hypertension, and hopefully, slow the progression of CKD. Nevertheless, according to the National Kidney Foundation, many patients continue to show declining kidney function, with the overall population having a lifetime risk of 3.6% of developing ESRD, where dialysis or a kidney transplant are needed. We believe DM199 offers a potentially novel approach for the treatment CKD since KLK1 protein plays a vital role in normal kidney function, and BK and BK receptors are critical for kidney health and integrity. Since patients with moderate to severe CKD often excrete abnormally low levels of KLK1 in their urine, we believe that DM199 may prevent or reduce further kidney damage by replenishing KLK1 levels and restoring the protective BK system.

Acute Ischemic Stroke
 
Stroke is characterized by the rapidly developing loss of brain function due to disturbance in the blood. As a result, the affected area of the brain becomes inactive and eventually dies. Strokes can be classified into two major categories: AIS and hemorrhagic stroke. AIS is characterized by interruption of the blood supply by a blood clot (ischemia), while a hemorrhagic stroke results from rupture, or bleeding, of a blood vessel or an abnormal vascular structure. According to the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), about 87% of strokes are ischemic in nature with the remainder classified as hemorrhagic. According to the CDC, worldwide, stroke is an important cause of adult disability and the second leading cause of death in developed countries. Risk factors for stroke include advanced age, hypertension (high blood pressure), previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (“TIA”), diabetes, high cholesterol, cigarette smoking and atrial fibrillation. According to the World Health Organization, each year approximately 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke, of which 5.5 million will die and 5.0 million will be permanently disabled. According to the CDC:

● | Every year in the United States, approximately 795,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke each year (ischemic or hemorrhagic). Approximately 610,000 of these are first events and 185,000 are recurrent stroke events.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stroke caused approximately one of every 20 deaths in the United States. On average, someone in the United States has a stroke every 40 seconds, and someone dies from a stroke every four minutes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stroke costs the United States $34 billion annually, including the cost of health care services, medications and lost productivity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
At the site of a blood flow blockage in the brain, there exist two major ischemic zones - the core ischemic zone with nearly complete loss of blood flow, and the surrounding ischemic penumbra having partially reduced blood flow. Within minutes, the significant lack of blood flow in the core (i.e., glucose and oxygen deprivation) rapidly depletes energy stores and triggers the loss of ion gradients, ultimately leading to neuronal cell death. The ischemic penumbra zone, however, may remain viable for several hours via collateral arteries that branch from the main occluded artery in the core zone. Unfortunately, the penumbra is at great risk of delayed tissue damage due to inflammation and cell death, or apoptosis. As time goes on, a lack of blood flow in the ischemic zone (infarct) leads to fluid buildup (edema) and swelling which creates intracranial pressure. This pressure on the brain leads to tissue compression resulting in additional ischemia. Additional events in AIS include vascular damage to the blood vessel lining or endothelium, loss of structural integrity of brain tissue and blood vessels, and inflammation. A stroke can lead to permanent damage with memory loss, speech problems, reading and comprehension difficulties, physical disabilities, and emotional/behavioral problems. The long-term costs of stroke are substantial, with many patients requiring extended hospitalization, extended physical therapy or rehabilitation, and/or long-term institutional or family care. However, provided the extended window of viability in the penumbra, next generation stroke therapies are being developed to protect valuable brain tissue during the hours to a week after a stroke.

Acute Ischemic Stroke Treatment Options
 


We believe that stroke represents an area of significant unmet medical need, and a KLK1 treatment (such as DM199) could provide a treatment option and a significant patient benefit with its proposed therapeutic window of up to 24 hours after the first sign of symptoms. Currently, the only pharmacological intervention for AIS is the use of tissue plasminogen activator (“tPA”), which must be given within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Mechanical thrombectomy, in which the clot is removed using catheter-based tools, is also available to some patients. Despite the availability of these treatments, many patients are not eligible due to the location of the clot, the elapsed time after the stroke occurred, or safety considerations. Thus, we believe DM199 offers significant advantages over the current treatment options and fills an unmet need for patients who cannot receive tPA. Additionally, DM199 may also offer a complimentary follow-on treatment for patients who initially receive tPA or mechanical thrombectomy treatments. Based on the number of strokes each year (approximately 1.7 million in the United States, Europe and Japan and 15 million worldwide) and the $8,500 estimated cost per patient for the current standard of care, tPA, we believe the annual market opportunity for DM199 could be significant.
DM199 Acute Ischemic Stroke: Proposed Mechanism

KLK1 in China (marketed under the brand name Kailikang®) is widely used for the treatment of AIS, making therapy available to hundreds of thousands of patients who currently have no options. Kailikang® is a human urine-extracted KLKl protein. We believe that the proprietary DM199 protein could result in an improved efficacy with optimized pharmacokinetics (drug level exposure) and avoid the side effects of risk of endotoxins, impurities and antibody formation in comparison to Kailikang® that is isolated from human urine. We also believe that DM199 addresses potential supply constraints that makes Kailikang® difficult and expensive to produce given the limited source of human urine. We believe these factors make the recombinant protein DM199 a product candidate that is better positioned for regulatory approval worldwide than a urine-derived protein since we believe it can meet the rigorous required manufacturing standards.
Potential Treatments with DM199
 
Chronic Kidney Disease
 
We also believe DM199 has the potential to offer therapeutic benefits for CKD patients. The KLK1 protein plays a vital role in normal kidney function, and BK and BK receptors are critical for kidney health and integrity. Patients with moderate to severe CKD often excrete abnormally low levels of KLK1 in their urine, leading to the hypothesis that this KLK1 deficit contributes to disease progression. We believe that DM199 may replenish KLK1 levels and activate the BK system that protects the kidney from damage. In fact, DM199 treatment in an animal model of Type 1 diabetes delayed the onset of the disease, attenuated the degree of insulitis (inflammation in the insulin producing islet cells of the pancreas) and improved pancreatic beta cell mass in a dose-dependent manner by increasing T-regs. By providing additional KLK1, DM199 has the following potentially beneficial actions:

● | Improve blood flow to the kidney by restoring proper regulation of blood flow through veins arteries and especially capillaries (vasoregulation);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Support the structural integrity of the kidney by reducing scar tissue formation (fibrosis), oxidative stress, and inflammation; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Activate mechanisms that upregulate T-regs, improve insulin sensitization, glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis, and lower blood pressure.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Further supporting the hypothesis that an intact KKS is critical for normal kidney function, a series of observational studies published in Immunopharmacology showed the amount of KLK1 released into the urine appears to be inversely correlated with the severity of disease in patients with CKD. Urinary KLK1 excretion was decreased in patients with both mild (not requiring dialysis) and severe (kidney failure/hemodialysis) renal disease compared to controls. The severity of the disease was negatively correlated with KLK1 excretion. Decreases in urinary KLK1 activity was seen especially when the reduction was associated with decreased glomerular filtration rate. We believe DM199 may potentially have advantages over ACEi because it restores already depleted KLK1 levels.
 
DM199 treatment is intended to directly replenish KLK1 levels, normalizing kidney function. Current treatment options, especially ACEi drugs, only partially restore kidney function and are associated with high-risk side effects. Importantly, it is becoming increasingly clear that part of the beneficial effect of ACEi drugs involves preventing the normal breakdown of BK leading to substantial increases in BK levels throughout the body. While higher BK levels benefit the kidney, ACEi drugs can generate excessive BK where is it not needed, potentially leading to side effects such as persistent cough, angioedema (swelling of skin and tissue) and hyperkalemia (abnormally high potassium levels that can lead to cardiac arrest and sudden death). We believe DM199 treatment could allow KLK1 to follow its normal physiological processes and release BK when and where it is needed, avoiding these side effects. Importantly, we believe successful treatment with ACEi in kidney disease requires a fully functional kallikrein kinin system, KLK1 and bradykinin systems, potentially making ACEi drugs less effective in patients with a pre-existing KLK1 deficit.

KLK1 derived from the pancreas of a pig, or porcine KLK1, is currently used to treat CKD in China and Japan. Porcine KLK1 is also used to treat hypertension and retinopathy in Japan, China and Korea. Based on IQVIA data and our estimates, we estimate millions of patients have been treated with porcine KLK1 for CKD, retinopathy and other vascular diseases in Asia. Over 20 clinical papers have been published in the Chinese literature supporting the therapeutic activity in CKD patients of porcine KLK1 given alone or in combination with an ARB or an ACEi. These unblinded studies involve treatment durations ranging from a few weeks up to six months and report improvement in kidney disease based on decreased urinary albumin excretion rates and other clinical endpoints of kidney disease.
 

There is a significant need for new and alternative treatment strategies for CKD and we believe that the combined results of these studies, which are consistent with our proposed mechanism of action for and preclinical studies of DM199, provide a good rationale for formal clinical development of DM199. We intend to seek approval for use of DM199 as a novel and ground-breaking therapy for CKD. We believe DM199 could potentially complement the use of ACEi or ARBs to improve kidney functions without increasing the risk for hyperkalemia, chronic cough, angioedema or other related side effects. Less than 30% of patients with CKD are believed to be on optimal dose of ACEi or ARB due in part to risk of hyperkalemia which can lead to cardiac arrest and sudden death. We believe DM199, through the activation of the BK system, may complement the renin-angiotensin system, primarily targeted by ACEi and ARBs. Activation of the BK system may improve the function of the diseased renal system by improving vasodilation and insulin sensitization, as well as blocking fibrosis, inflammation, thrombosis and oxidative stress. A significant potential advantage of DM199 over ACEi/ARB treatments is that hyperkalemia may be less likely with DM199. We anticipate that DM199 will boost KLK1 levels to release physiological levels of BK when and where needed, generating beneficial nitric oxide and prostacyclin while increasing regulatory T cells (T-regs or TREGS) to reduce inflammation.

DM199 (Recombinant KLK1), ACEi, ARB and Plasma Kallikrein Proposed Mechanism of Actions
 

Acute Ischemic Stroke
 
We believe treatment of AIS with DM199 could have both immediate and long-term benefits for patients that could significantly improve outcomes following AIS. Immediate actions include activation of the KKS to release nitric oxide and improve microcirculation in ischemic tissue along with improvements in the balance between blood flow and brain activity (neurovascular coupling). Long-term (days following the stroke) actions include the restoration of the blood brain barrier through increases in T regulatory cells (“T-regs” – a subpopulation of T cells that modulate the immune system and prevent autoimmune disease) and inhibition of apoptotic cell death.
 
In China, a human urine-extracted KLKl protein (Kailikang®) is approved and marketed by Techpool Bio-Pharma Inc., a company controlled by Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co. Ltd. We believe Kailikang® has been approved for the treatment of AIS in China with a treatment window of up to 48 hours post-stroke. Based on IQVIA data, other publications and internal estimates, we believe over 500,000 stroke patients have been treated with Kailikang® for acute ischemic stroke in Asia. More than 50 published clinical studies, covering over 4,000 stroke patients, have demonstrated a beneficial effect of Kailikang® treatment in AIS. According to a publication in the China Journal of Neurology, in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 446 patients treated with either KLK1 or a placebo administered up to 48 hours after a stroke showed significantly better scores on the European Stroke Scale and Activities of Daily Living at three weeks post-treatment and after three months using the Barthel Index.

Furthermore, a comprehensive meta-analysis covering 24 clinical studies involving 2,433 patients published in the Journal of Evidenced Based Medicine concluded that human urinary KLK1 appears to ameliorate neurological deficits for patients with AIS and improves long-term outcomes, though a few treated patients suffered from transient hypotension.
 
As DM199 is a recombinant form of human KLK1, we believe it has the potential to preserve “at risk” brain tissue by increasing cerebral blood flow, establishing better collateral circulation, decreasing inflammation, reducing cell death, or apoptosis, and facilitating improved blood flow to at-risk ischemic penumbra brain tissue. We believe DM199 offers the potential for an improved recombinant product for worldwide use. We are developing DM199 to treat AIS patients with therapy beyond the current window of 3 to 4.5 hours for tPA to up to 24 hours after the first sign of symptoms, thereby filling a large unmet need of patients who cannot receive tPA under the currently available treatment window of tPA. We believe this could potentially make therapy available to the millions of patients worldwide who currently have limited options.
 
Other Potential Programs
 
We are also currently developing a diagnostic tool, DMDx, to measure KLK1 levels. Several published studies indicate KLK1 insufficiency is associated with multiple disease states including hypertension, CKD and AIS. Levels of endogenous KLK1 in both urine and plasma are inversely correlated with disease severity. Importantly, the decrease in urinary protein occurs in a disease state (e.g. CKD), where a primary hallmark is increased secretion of many other proteins. In this way, we believe KLK1 is a potentially unique diagnostic tool for such diseases.
 
We believe DM199 may also offer a potentially novel treatment for vascular dementia patients. Vascular dementia is caused by chronic impaired blood supply within the brain, often associated with TIA or prior stroke. According to the Alzheimer’s Society, one third of all stroke survivors could develop dementia within five years. According to the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, there are over 6 million stroke survivors in the United States alone. In a clinical study, KLK1 isolated from human urine demonstrated the ability to improve cognitive function in vascular dementia patients and increase cerebral blood flow. We have drafted a protocol synopsis for a Phase II study in vascular dementia. Our decision to commence this study will be dependent upon our cash resources.

Our Competition and Current Treatments for Chronic Kidney Disease and Acute Ischemic Stroke
 
The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapidly advancing technologies that focus on rapid development of proprietary drugs. We believe that our product candidates, development capabilities, experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages. However, we face significant potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, and experience in obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for competitive products and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effectively marketed and sold than any products we may commercialize, thus limiting our market share and resulting in a longer period before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidates.
 
Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These activities may lead to consolidated efforts that allow for more rapid development of competitive product candidates.
 
We also compete for staff, development and clinical resources. These competitors may impair our ability to recruit or retain qualified scientific and management personnel, our ability to work with specific advisors, clinical contract organizations, due to conflicts of interest or capacity constraints, and may also delay recruitment of clinical study sites and study volunteers, impeding progress in our development programs.
 
We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government or other third-party payers. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are viewed as safer, more effective or less expensive than any products that we may develop.
 
Chronic Kidney Disease
 
In the United States, we are aware of only one currently approved treatment for CKD. That treatment is an ACEi (marketed under the brand name Captopril®) which is approved for the treatment of patients with CKD caused by Type 1 diabetes. There are several pharmaceutical products for the treatment of CKD currently in clinical development, some of which include:

● | Mineralcorticortisteroid receptor agonist (Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals LLC)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | CCR2 receptor antagonists (ChemoCentryx, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Oxidative stress, cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitors (Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Glycosylation inhibitors (Glycadia, Inc. aka Glycadia Pharmaceuticals)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Endothelin A receptor antagonists (AbbVie Inc.)
--+------------------------------------------------


● | Cyclin nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor (Pfizer Inc.)
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | Aldosterone receptor antagonists (Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nitric oxide enzyme inhibitor (GenKyoTex SA)
--+---------------------------------------------


● | Nitric oxide (Cyclerion/Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)
--+--------------------------------------------------------

Current treatment strategies for CKD include the strict control of high blood pressure and high blood sugar. The ACEi drug Captopril is approved for use in patients with CKD due to Type 1 diabetes and both ACEi and ARBs are widely prescribed to slow the progression of CKD. However, according to the National Kidney Foundation, 3.6% of the U.S. population over their lifetime will develop ESRD requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation. Furthermore, the treatment with ACEi and ARBs has been linked to hyperkalemia (elevated blood potassium levels), which increases the risk for abnormal heart rhythms and sudden death. In fact, two clinical trials investigating the use of ACEi and ARB combination therapy in kidney disease were stopped prematurely because participants developed hyperkalemia. The added complication of hyperkalemia results in patients receiving suboptimal dosing or patients being untreated because they cannot tolerate the treatment. Additional side effects with ACEi treatment are angioedema (swelling of skin tissue) and persistent cough.
 
DM199 treatment is intended to directly replenish KLK1 levels, normalizing kidney function. Current treatment options, especially ACEi drugs, only partially restore kidney function and the association with high-risk side effects. ACEi drugs can generate excessive BK where is it not needed, potentially leading to related side effects such as cough and angioedema (swelling of skin and tissue). We believe DM199 treatment would potentially allow KLK1 to follow its normal physiological processes and release BK when and where it is needed, avoiding these side effects. Importantly, successful treatment with ACEi in kidney disease requires a fully functional KLK1 system, potentially making ACEi drugs less effective in patients with a pre-existing KLK1 deficit.
 
Acute Ischemic Stroke
 
Currently, there is one approved pharmaceutical treatment for acute ischemic stroke. That treatment is tPA (marketed under the brand name Activase®), and its therapeutic window is limited to 3 to 4.5 hours after the AIS. There are, however, a number of companies that are actively pursuing a variety of approaches to develop pharmaceutical products for the treatment of AIS including, among others:

● | Stem cells (Athersys, Inc.)
--+----------------------------


● | Cerebral edema (Biogen Inc.)
--+-----------------------------


● | Anti-inflammatory and clot dissolving (Biogen Inc.)
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Cell protection and anti-inflammation (ZZ Biotech LLC)
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | Inhibits platelet aggregation (Acticor Biotech SAS)
--+----------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that there is a large unmet therapeutic need for AIS treatments that can be administered beyond the 3 to 4.5-hour time window of tPA. With this large unmet therapeutic need, there is significant competition to develop new therapeutic options. New therapeutic options in development include tissue protection focused therapies (deliverable from hours to days after the stroke) that preserve and protect brain cells beyond the tPA therapeutic window. Currently, the most advanced treatments involve the mechanical removal of blood clots in brain arteries through sophisticated catheter-based approaches. According to published research, use of mechanical thrombectomy is growing and the window of time after a stroke where the procedure can be used is widening. These therapies are especially targeted toward preserving viable cells in the ischemic penumbra hours after a stroke. The goal is to provide treatment options for the vast majority of AIS patients who do not receive hospital care early enough to qualify for tPA therapy. We believe there is a very significant market opportunity for a drug that has a therapeutic window beyond that of tPA and is able to obtain regulatory approval.
 
In January 2019, we announced the publication of a paper titled “Human Tissue Kallikrein In The Treatment Of Acute Ischemic Stroke” in the peer reviewed journal, Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders (“TAND”). The paper reviews the scientific literature covering the biochemical role of KLK1 and presents the mechanistic rationale for using KLK1 as an additional pharmacological treatment for AIS. In addition to the biochemical mechanism of KLK1, the review highlights supporting results from human genetics and preclinical animal models of brain ischemia. It also reviews published clinical results for treatment of AIS by a form of KLK1 that is isolated from human urine. This form has been approved for post-infarct treatment of AIS in China and data has been published on clinical trials involving over 4,000 patients. The paper offers a series of testable therapeutic hypotheses for demonstrating the long-term beneficial effect of KLK1 treatment in AIS patients and the reasons for this action.

DM199 Clinical Studies
 
We have completed five clinical trials with DM199 in over 120 volunteers, including multiple Phase I single dose ascending and multiple dose ascending studies in healthy volunteers and patients with Type 2 diabetes. Chronic dosing studies over 16 to 28 days were also conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with Type 2 diabetes. (see Table 1 below). As is generally the case for early phase clinical trials, the primary endpoints for all studies were safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. The Phase II (Part D) study also investigated a series of secondary endpoints that included blood glucose concentration, insulin levels, glucose tolerance testing and a variety of experimental biomarkers of evaluating the potential efficacy of DM199 in treating Type 2 diabetes patients.
Table 1 DM199 Trial Design Overview
 

Trial | Participants (N) | Design | Doses (µg/kg) | Route | Length 
-----------------+----------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+----------+----------------------
Phase-I Part A | Healthy (32) | Single ascending dose | 5, 15, 30, 50 | SC | 1 week 
Phase-I Part B | Type 2 diabetes (10) | Single ascending dose | 0.3, 1.5, 15 | SC | 1 week 
Phase-I Part C | Healthy (18) | Multiple ascending dose | 3, 15, 25 | SC | 6 doses over 16 days 
Phase-IIA Part D | Type 2 diabetes (36) | Blinded multiple dose | Placebo, 3, 15 | SC | 10 doses over 28 days
Phase I Bridging | Healthy (36) | Single ascending dose | 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 1.0 3.0 | IV IV SC | 1 week 

 
In combination, these studies showed that DM199 was well tolerated and demonstrated clear physiological activity. After subcutaneous (“SC”) injection (under the skin), DM199 exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with extended half-life (i.e., the time required to reduce concentration of the drug in the body by one-half), supporting potential dosing intervals of up to one week. The dose-limiting tolerability issue in healthy volunteers was orthostatic hypotension (a condition in which blood pressure falls significantly when a person stands) observed largely at the 50 µg/kg dose level, which is much greater than those anticipated to be efficacious in patients. In each trial, observed treatment emergent side-effects were mild to moderate in severity and resolved. The most common treatment-emergent side effects included headache, dizziness, nausea and injection site pain, the majority of which were observed in the highest dose group of the Phase I-Part A trial.
 
Two of our clinical studies have focused on patients with Type 2 diabetes. The first study enrolled 10 Type 2 diabetic patients. The patients were dosed with either DM199, at three single ascending dose levels or placebo. DM199 was well-tolerated at all three dose levels by the diabetic patients with no dose limiting side effects. The second study in patients with Type 2 diabetes enrolled 36 patients treated with one of two SC dose levels of DM199 or placebo over 28 days. This study achieved its primary endpoints and demonstrated that DM199 was well-tolerated. The secondary endpoints for this study, however, were not met. The secondary efficacy endpoints were confounded due to what we believe were significant execution errors caused by protocol deviations occurring at the clinical trial site that were unable to be reconciled. See “Part I. Item 1. Business—Legal Proceedings” for more information on this study.

In February 2018, we initiated treatment on the first patient in our Phase II REMEDY trial assessing the safety, tolerability and markers of therapeutic efficacy of DM199 in patients suffering from AIS. Our REMEDY trial is expected to enroll up to 100 patients to evaluate DM199 in patients with AIS. The study drug (DM199 or placebo) will be administered as an intravenous (“IV”) infusion within 24 hours of stroke symptom onset, followed by SC injections later that day and once every 3 days for 21 days. The study is designed to measure safety and tolerability along with multiple tests designed to investigate DM199’s therapeutic potential including plasma-based biomarkers and standard functional stroke measures assessed at 90 days post-stroke. Standard functional stroke measurements include the Modified Rankin Scale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, the Barthel Index and C-reactive protein, a measure of inflammation.
 
In February 2019, we began enrolling patients in a Phase Ib clinical study evaluating DM199 in CKD patients, This study is being conducted at 3 sites in the U.S. and all sites are actively enrolling patients. The open label clinical trial is evaluating three dose levels of DM199, administered by a single subcutaneous (“SC”) dose, in 32 patients with moderate or severe CKD. Primary endpoints include safety, tolerability pharmacokinetics, change in KLK1 levels, albumin to creatine ratios and kidney biomarkers measured over a 12-day period. This study is intended to assist in identifying dose levels for use in subsequent Phase II trials.
 
In 2017, we completed and published in the International Journal of Clinical Trials the results from a Phase lb study with DM199 designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers. Specifically, this study compared multiple doses levels of DM199, administered via IV and SC routes to identify a dose and delivery route that most closely compared to or improves upon the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profile of the approved urinary KLK1 in China. We found that a dose of DM199 administered via IV infusion mimicked the drug profile of IV-administered urinary derived KLK1 (Kailikang®). We believe that this study also identified a dose of DM199, administered via SC injection, which had a superior pharmacokinetic profile and that maintained more normal KLK1 levels throughout day. Below are results from our clinical trial showing the pharmacokinetic profile of subcutaneously administered DM199 observed in study subjects as compared to what we believe is normal range in healthy subjects.
 

Potential DM199 Commercial Advantages
 
Several researchers have studied the structural and functional properties of KLK1. This deep body of knowledge has revealed the potential clinical benefits of KLK1 treatments. Today, forms of KLK1 derived from human urine and porcine pancreas are sold in Japan, China and Korea to treat acute ischemic stroke, chronic kidney disease, retinopathy, hypertension and related diseases. We are not aware of any synthetic version of KLK1 with regulatory approval for human use in any country, nor are we aware of any synthetic version in development besides our drug candidate DM199 (recombinant human KLK1). We believe at least five companies have attempted to create a synthetic version of KLK1.
 
 16



The growing understanding of KLK1’s role in human health and its use in Asia as an approved therapeutic highlight two important potential commercial advantages for DM199:
 

● | KLK1 treatment is sold in Japan, China and Korea. Research has shown that patients with low levels of KLK1 are associated with a variety of diseases related to vascular dysfunction, such as chronic kidney disease, acute ischemic strokes, retinopathy and hypertension. Clinical trial data with human urine and porcine KLK1 has demonstrated statistically significant clinical benefits of treating a variety of patients with KLK1 compared to placebo. These efficacy results are further substantiated by established markets in Japan, China and Korea for pharmaceutical sales of KLK1 derived from human urine and porcine pancreas.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | KLK1 treatment has had limited side effects and has been well tolerated in studies to date. KLK1 is naturally produced by the human body; and therefore, the body’s own control mechanisms act to limit potential side effects. The only notable side effect observed in our clinical trials was orthostatic hypotension, or sudden drop in blood pressure, which was only seen at doses significantly higher than our anticipated therapeutic dose levels. Routine clinical use of KLK1 treatment in Asia has been well-tolerated by patients. In 2017, we completed a clinical trial comparing the pharmacokinetic profile of DM199 to Kailikang® for acute ischemic stroke, which showed DM199, when administered in intravenous form, to have a profile similar to Kailikang®. Further, when DM199 was administered subcutaneously, DM199 demonstrated a superior, longer acting, pharmacokinetic profile to Kailikang®.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have conducted numerous internal and third-party analyses to demonstrate that DM199 is structurally and functionally equivalent to KLK1 derived from human urine. The amino acid structure of DM199 is identical to the human urine form, and the enzymatic and pharmacokinetic profiles are substantially similar to both human urinary and porcine derived KLK1. The physiological effects of DM199 on blood pressure, from our completed studies, mirror that of human urinary and porcine-derived forms of KLK1. We believe that the results of this work suggest that the therapeutic action of DM199 will be the same or better than that of the forms marketed in Asia. In addition, we believe that there are also significant formulation, manufacturing, regulatory and other advantages for our synthetic human KLK1 drug candidate DM199:
 

● | Potency and Impurity Considerations. KLK1 derived from human urine or porcine pancreas may contain impurities, endotoxins, and chemical byproducts due to the inherent variability of the isolation and purification process. We believe that this creates the risk of inconsistencies in potency and impurities from one production run to the next. However, we expect to produce a consistent formulation of KLK1 that is free of endotoxins and other impurities, which we believe will provide therapeutic benefits.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cost and Scalability. Large quantities of human urine and porcine pancreas must be obtained to derive a small amount of KLK1. This creates potential procurement, cost and logistical challenges to source the necessary raw organic material, particularly for human urine sourced KLK1. Once sourced, the raw organic material is processed using chemicals and costly capital equipment and produces a significant amount of byproduct waste. Our novel recombinant manufacturing process utilizes widely available raw materials and can be readily scaled for commercial production. Accordingly, we believe our manufacturing process has significant cost and scalability advantages.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regulatory. We are not aware of any attempts by manufacturers of the urine or porcine based KLK1 products to pursue regulatory approvals in the United States. We believe that this is related to challenges presented by using inconsistent and potentially hazardous biomaterials, such as human urine and porcine pancreas, and their resulting ability to produce a consistent drug product. Our novel recombinant manufacturing process utilizes widely available raw materials which we believe provides a significant regulatory advantage, particularly in regions such as the United States, Europe and Canada, where safety standards are high. In addition, we believe that DM199 could qualify for 12 years of data exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, which was enacted as part of the ACA.

Regulatory Approval
 
Securing regulatory approval for the manufacture and sale of human therapeutic products in the United States, Europe, Canada and other commercial territories is a long and costly process that is controlled by that particular territory’s national regulatory agency. The national regulatory agency in the United States is the FDA, in Europe it is EMA, and in Canada it is Health Canada. Other national regulatory agencies have similar regulatory approval processes, but each national regulatory agency has its own approval processes. Approval in the United States, Europe or Canada does not assure approval by other national regulatory agencies, although often test results from one country may be used in applications for regulatory approval in another country.
 
Prior to obtaining regulatory approval to market a drug product, every national regulatory agency has a variety of statutes and regulations which govern the principal development activities. These laws require controlled research and testing of products, governmental review, and approval of a submission containing preclinical and clinical data establishing the safety and efficacy of the product for each use sought, approval of manufacturing facilities including adherence to good manufacturing practices (“GMP”) during production and storage, and control of marketing activities, including advertising, labeling and pricing approval.
 
None of our product candidates have been completely developed or tested; and, therefore, we are not yet in a position to seek regulatory approval in any territory to market any of our product candidates.
 
The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the applicable regulatory authority to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
 
U.S. Approval Process
 
In the United States, the FDA, a federal government agency, is responsible for the drug approval process. The FDA’s mission is to ensure that all medications on the market are safe and effective. The FDA’s approval process examines potential drugs; and only those that meet strict requirements are approved.
 
The U.S. food and drug regulations require licensing of manufacturing facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of products, governmental review and approval of test results prior to marketing of therapeutic products, and adherence to GMP, as defined by each licensing jurisdiction, during production.

The drug approval process begins with the discovery of a potential drug. Pharmaceutical companies then test the drug extensively. A description of the different stages in the drug approval process in the United States follows.
 
Stage 1: Preclinical Research. After an experimental drug is discovered, research is conducted to help determine its potential for treating or curing an illness. This is called preclinical research. Animal and/or bench studies are conducted to determine if there are any harmful effects of the drug and to help understand how the drug works. Information from these experiments is submitted to the FDA in an IND. The FDA reviews the information in the IND and decides if the drug is safe to study in humans.
Stage 2: Clinical Research. In Stage 2, the experimental drug is studied in humans. The studies are known as clinical trials. Clinical trials are carefully designed and controlled experiments in which the experimental drug is administered to patients to test its safety and to determine the effectiveness of an experimental drug. The four general phases of clinical research are described below.
Phase I Clinical Studies. Phase I clinical studies are generally conducted with healthy volunteers who are not taking other medicines; patients with the illness that the drug is intended to treat are not tested at this stage. Ultimately, Phase I studies demonstrate how an experimental drug affects the body of a healthy individual. Phase I consists of a series of small studies consisting of “tens” of volunteers. Tests are done on each volunteer throughout the study to see how the person’s body processes, responds to, and is affected by the drug. Low doses and high doses of the drug are usually studied, resulting in the determination of the safe dosage range in volunteers by the end of Phase I. This information will determine whether the drug proceeds to Phase II.
Phase II Clinical Studies. Phase II clinical studies are conducted in order to determine how an experimental drug affects people who have the disease to be treated. Phase II usually consists of a limited number of studies that help determine the drug’s short-term safety, side effects, and general effectiveness. The studies in Phase II often are controlled investigations involving comparison between the experimental drug and a placebo, or between the experimental drug and an existing drug. Information gathered in Phase II studies will determine whether the drug proceeds to Phase III.
Phase III Clinical Studies. Phase III clinical studies are expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials that are used to more fully investigate the safety and effectiveness of the drug. These trials differ from Phase II trials because a larger number of patients are studied (sometimes in the thousands) and because the studies are usually of longer duration. As well, Phase Ill studies can include patients who have more than one illness and are taking medications in addition to the experimental drug used in the study. Therefore, the patients in Phase III studies more closely reflect the general population. The information from Phase III forms the basis for most of the drug’s initial labeling, which will guide physicians on how to use the drug.
Phase IV Clinical Studies. Phase IV clinical studies are conducted after a drug is approved. Companies often conduct Phase IV studies to more fully understand how their drug compares to other drugs. Also, the FDA may require additional studies after the drug is approved. FDA-required Phase IV studies often investigate the drug in specific types of patients that may not have been included in the Phase III studies and can involve very large numbers of patients to further assess the drug’s safety.
 
Stage 3: FDA Review for Approval. Following Phase III, the pharmaceutical company prepares reports of all studies conducted on the drug and a complete dossier on the manufacturing of the product and submits the reports to the FDA in a New Drug Application (“NDA”). The FDA reviews the information in the NDA to determine if the drug is safe and effective for its intended use. Occasionally, the FDA will ask experts for their opinion of the drug. If the FDA determines that the drug is safe and effective, the drug will be approved.
 
 19



Stage 4: Marketing. After the FDA has approved the experimental drug, the pharmaceutical company can make it available to physicians and their patients. A company also may continue to conduct research to discover new uses for the drug. Each time a new use for a drug is discovered, the drug once again is subject to the entire FDA approval process before it can be marketed for that purpose.
 
Any pharmaceutical products for which FDA approvals are obtained are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties.
 
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
 
We believe that DM199 could qualify for 12 years of data exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the “BPCIA”), which was enacted as part of the ACA. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product (“BLA”) cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years, or if approved by the FDA, until 12 years, after the original brand product identified as the reference product is approved under a BLA. The BPCIA provides an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on its similarity to an existing brand product. The new law is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA.
 
European Approval Process
 
The EMA is roughly parallel to the U.S. FDA in terms of the drug approval process and the strict requirements for approval. The EMA was set up in 1995 in an attempt to harmonize, but not replace, the work of existing national medicine regulatory bodies in individual European countries. As with the FDA, the EMA drug review and approval process follows different stages from preclinical testing through clinical testing in Phase I, II, and III. There are some differences between the FDA and EMA review process, specifically the review process in individual European countries. Such differences may allow certain drug products to be tested in patients at an earlier stage of development.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other divisions of the U.S. government, including, the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, if a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal or state healthcare programs, our company, including our sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs, must comply with the federal False Claims Act, as amended, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, as amended, and similar state laws. If a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (“OBRA”), and the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Among other things, OBRA requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs and empowers states to negotiate rebates on pharmaceutical prices, which may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Additionally, the ACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. There may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, in the future, some of which could further limit coverage and reimbursement of drug products. If drug products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements may apply.
 
 20



Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payers often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Third-party payers are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy; and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. In particular, in the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. As a result, coverage and adequate third party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development.
 
The market for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payers’ drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payers provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payers may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or may otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or another alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payer individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. We would be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product candidate to each third-party payer separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates. This process could delay the market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. If we are unable to obtain coverage and adequate payment levels for our product candidates from third-party payers, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
 
 21



Research and Development
 
We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development (“R&D”) which therefore comprises the largest component of our operating costs. Our primary focus over the past approximately eight years has been our lead product candidate, DM199, which is currently in clinical development for AIS and CKD.
 
We expect our R&D expenses will continue to increase in the future as we advance our initial product candidate through clinical trials in AIS and CKD and seek to expand our product candidate portfolio. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming and we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be integral to our long-term success. The actual probability of success for each product candidate, clinical indication and preclinical program may be affected by a variety of factors including, among other things, the safety and efficacy data for product candidates, amounts invested in the program, competition and competitive developments, manufacturing capability and commercial viability.
 
Research and development expenses include:
 

● | expenses incurred under contract research agreements and other agreements with third parties;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expenses incurred under agreements with clinical trial sites that conduct research and development activities on our behalf;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | employee and consultant-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits, travel and share-based compensation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of clinical trials and non-clinical studies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the cost of acquiring, developing, manufacturing, and distributing clinical trial materials; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | facilities and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, and other supply costs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities such as clinical trials are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites.
 
We expect that it will be several years, if ever, before we have any product candidates ready for commercialization.
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of DM199 nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We rely on Catalent Pharma Solutions, LLC (“Catalent”) for all of our required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished DM199 product candidate for our clinical trials. We have licensed certain gene expression technology and we contract with Catalent for the manufacture of DM199. The royalty term is indefinite but may be canceled by us on 90 days’ prior written notice. The license may not be terminated by Catalent unless we fail to make required milestone and royalty payments. We currently employ internal resources and third-party consultants to manage our manufacturing relationship with Catalent.
 
 22



Sales and Marketing
 
We have not yet defined our sales, marketing or product distribution strategy for our initial product candidate, or any future product candidates, because it is still early in the clinical development stage. We currently expect to partner with a large pharmaceutical company for sales execution. However, our future commercial strategy may include the use of distributors, a contract sales force or the establishment of our own commercial and specialty sales force, as well as similar strategies for regions and territories outside the United States.
Intellectual Property
 
We view patents and other means of intellectual property protection including trade secrets as an important component of our core business. We focus on translating our innovations into intangible property protecting our proprietary technology from infringement by competitors. To that end, patents are reviewed frequently and continue to be sought in relation to those components or concepts of our preclinical and clinical products to provide protection. Our strategy, where possible, is to file patent applications to protect our product candidates, as well as methods of manufacturing, administering and using a product candidate. Prior art searches of both patent and scientific databases are performed to evaluate novelty, inventiveness and freedom-to-operate. We require all employees, consultants, and parties to sign a collaborative research agreement and to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, consulting relationships, or a collaboration with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the engagement with us is to be kept confidential. We also maintain agreements with our scientific staff and all parties contracted in a scientific capacity affirming that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, using our property, or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period covered by the agreement are the exclusive property of our company.
 
Our patent portfolio includes patents and pending applications that are owned by us, which include claims for composition of matter and methods of use. For our DM199 program, this includes two patent families that are directed to composition of matter, and methods of use.
 
The DM199 patents protect composition of matter including compositions of glycoforms, formulations, methods of administration and a variety of therapeutic approaches pertaining to current and potential future indications. We currently have additional patent applications for DM199. Additionally, for the manufacture of DM199, we have licensed an expression system and cell line with proven GMP and regulatory support and are contracting with a contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”) with proven GMP experience in manufacturing of recombinant proteins for clinical trials.
 
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of DM199. We intend to rely on Catalent for the manufacture of DM199. We have licensed certain gene expression technology and we contract with Catalent for the manufacture of DM199. Under the terms of this license, certain milestone and royalty payments may become due and are dependent upon, among other factors, performing clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and ultimately the successful development of a new drug, the outcome and timing of which is uncertain. The royalty term is indefinite but may be canceled by us on 90 days’ prior written notice. The license may not be terminated by Catalent unless we fail to make required milestone and royalty payments.
 
Our DM199 patent portfolio includes granted U.S. patents, a granted European patent, one pending U.S. patent application and a worldwide pending application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”). Granted or pending claims offer various forms of protection for DM199 including claims to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, specific formulations and dosing levels, and methods for treating a variety of diseases, including stroke, chronic kidney disease, and related disorders. These U.S. patents and applications, and their foreign equivalents, are described in more detail below.
 
 23



Issued patents held by us cover the DM199 composition of matter based on an optimized combination of closely-related isoforms that differ in the extent of glycosylation (process by which sugars are chemically attached to proteins). Issued claims in this patent family cover the most pharmacologically active variants of DM199 and methods of using the same for treating ischemic conditions and these patents are due to expire in 2033. A second patent family includes an issued U.S. patent with claims directed to methods of treating subjects by administering a SC formulation of DM199 or related recombinant kallikrein-1 polypeptides. The PCT patent application is directed to a range of dose levels and dosing regimens of DM199 that are potentially useful for treating a wide range of diseases including, e.g. pulmonary arterial hypertension, cardiac ischemia, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, stroke, and vascular dementia.
 
Methods and reagents required for commercial scale manufacture of DM199 are subject to a series of patents issued to our manufacturing partner. As noted above, we exclusively license these patents from our manufacturing partner for the production of DM199 or any human KLK1 protein. We believe that our proprietary technology along with trade secrets will provide substantial protection from third-party competitors. We believe DM199 cannot be reversed engineered for a copycat version to be made. In addition, DiaMedica has specialized knowledge of the manufacturing process.
 
We believe that the most relevant granted patents with composition of matter or method of use claims covering DM199 are listed below, along with their projected expiration dates exclusive of any patent term extension.

License Agreement
 
In September 2018, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Ahon Pharmaceutical Co Ltd. (“Ahon Pharma”), which grants Ahon Pharma exclusive rights to develop and commercialize DM199 for acute ischemic stroke in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong S.A.R. and Macau S.A.R. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $500,000 on signing and are entitled to receive an additional payment of $4.5 million upon regulatory clearance to initiate a clinical trial in China. We also have the potential to receive up to an additional $27.5 million in development and sales related milestones and up to approximately 10% royalties on net sales of DM199 in the licensed territories. All development, regulatory, sales, marketing, and commercial activities and associated costs in the licensed territories will be the sole responsibility of Ahon Pharma. This agreement may be terminated at any time by Ahon Pharma by providing 120 days written notice. Fosun Pharma, through its partnership with SK Group, a South Korea based company is an investor in DiaMedica through its equity investment in 2016.

Enforceability of Civil Liabilities Against Foreign Persons
 
We are organized under and governed by the federal laws of Canada, and, accordingly, are governed by the applicable laws of Canada. There is doubt as to the enforceability, in original actions in Canadian courts, of liabilities based upon the U.S. federal securities laws or the securities laws or “blue sky” laws of any state within the United States and as to the enforceability in Canadian courts of judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws or any such state securities laws or blue sky laws. Accordingly, it may not be possible to enforce judgments obtained in the United States against us.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
As a company with less than $1.07 billion of revenue during our last fiscal year, we are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”), and we may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years from December 31, 2018. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a large accelerated filer, our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion, or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure and other requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. In particular, in this report, we have provided only two years of audited financial statements and have not included certain other information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold equity interests. However, we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and, therefore, we are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
