     We are headquartered in Broomfield, Colorado, and our stock is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BLL.
     Our Strategy
     Our overall business strategy is defined by our Drive for 10 vision, which at its highest level, is a mindset around perfection, with a greater sense of urgency around our future success. Launched in 2011, our Drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our businesses and achieving long-term success. These five levers are:
· | Maximizing value in our existing businesses
--+--------------------------------------------


· | Expanding into new products and capabilities
--+---------------------------------------------


· | Aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | Broadening our geographic reach and
--+------------------------------------


· | Leveraging our know-how and technological expertise to provide a competitive advantage
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We also maintain a clear and disciplined financial strategy focused on improving shareholder returns through:
    
· | Seeking to deliver comparable diluted earnings per share growth of 10 percent to 15 percent per annum over the long-term
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maximizing free cash flow generation
--+-------------------------------------


· | Increasing Economic Value Added (EVA®) dollars
--+-----------------------------------------------

 The cash generated by our businesses is used primarily: (1) to finance the company’s operations, (2) to fund strategic capital investments, (3) to service the company’s debt and (4) to return value to our shareholders via stock buy-backs and dividend payments. From time to time, we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible transactions that we believe will benefit the company and our shareholders, which may include strategic acquisitions, divestitures of parts of our company or joint ventures. At any time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible transactions or may have entered into non-binding letters of intent. There can be no assurance if or when we will enter into any such transactions or the terms of such transactions. The compensation of many of our employees is tied directly to the company’s performance through our EVA®-based incentive programs.
     Sustainability
     Sustainability is a key part of our business strategy at Ball. By enhancing the unique sustainability credentials of our products along their life cycles, we position our metal containers as the most sustainable packaging choice and help our customers grow their businesses. Aluminum is an infinitely recyclable material. It also has the highest scrap value of all commonly used packaging substrates. These qualities make cans an increasingly attractive option for sustainability-conscious consumers and brands who acknowledge that metal packaging is a true enabler of a circular economy in terms of economic value, recyclability, real recycling and the avoidance of down cycling.  In 2017, Resource Recycling Systems recognized aluminum beverage cans as the most recycled beverage package in the world, with a global weighted average recycling rate for aluminum of 69 percent. This finding solidifies the aluminum can as the leader in real recycling, where the package is collected and then transformed into an item of equal value (product to product or material to material recycling). In comparison, only 43 percent of PET and 46 percent of glass bottles were collected for recycling, although not necessarily recycled. 
     In some of Ball’s markets such as Brazil, China and several European countries, recycling rates for aluminum beverage cans are at or above 90 percent. The most recently available recycling rates for aluminum beverage cans are 97 percent in Brazil in 2017, 74 percent in Europe in 2015, and 49 percent in the U.S. in 2016. 
     We focus our sustainability efforts on product stewardship, operational excellence, talent management and community engagement. In our global operations, we work on continuous improvement of employee safety, energy and water efficiency, waste generation and air emissions. 
     Because metal recycling saves resources and uses significantly less energy than primary metal production, the biggest opportunity to further enhance the positive environmental attributes of metal packaging is to increase recycling rates. In markets where recycling rates are below where we believe they should be, we help establish and financially support packaging collection and recycling initiatives. These initiatives typically focus on collaborating with public and private partners to create effective collection and recycling systems, including education of consumers about the sustainability benefits of metal packaging. 
     Our Reportable Segments
     Ball Corporation reports its financial performance in four reportable segments: (1) beverage packaging, North and Central America; (2) beverage packaging, South America; (3) beverage packaging, Europe and (4) aerospace. Ball also has investments in the U.S., Guatemala, Panama, South Korea and Vietnam that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or earnings. Financial information related to each of our segments is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (annual report).
     On July 31, 2018, Ball sold its U.S. steel food and steel aerosol packaging business and formed a joint venture, Ball Metalpack. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report for further information.  As a result of the sale, the remaining global aluminum aerosol and Argentine steel aerosol businesses of the legacy food and aerosol packaging segment are now a non-reportable segment that manufactures and sells aerosol containers, extruded aluminum aerosol containers and aluminum slugs (aerosol packaging). For comparative periods, the entire former food and aerosol packaging segment is now presented within other.

 Beverage Packaging, North and Central America, Segment
     Beverage packaging, North and Central America is Ball’s largest segment, accounting for 40 percent of consolidated net sales in 2018. Metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multi-year supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks, beer, energy drinks and other beverages.
     Metal beverage containers and ends are produced at 17 manufacturing facilities in the U.S., one in Canada and two in Mexico.  The beverage packaging, North and Central America, segment also includes interests in three joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity method. 
     The North American beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature. Where growth or contractions are projected in certain markets or for certain products, Ball undertakes selected capacity increases or decreases primarily in its existing facilities to meet market demand. A meaningful portion of the industry-wide reduction in demand for standard 12-ounce aluminum cans for the carbonated soft drink market is being offset with growing demand for specialty container volumes from new and existing customers and consumer demand. During 2016, we began production at our newly constructed beverage can and end manufacturing facility in Monterrey, Mexico. In order to serve growing customer demand for specialty cans in the southwestern U.S., the company constructed a four line beverage packaging facility in Goodyear, Arizona, which began production in the second quarter of 2018.
     According to publicly available information and company estimates, the North American beverage container industry represents approximately 112 billion units. Five companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.  Ball produced approximately 46 billion recyclable aluminum beverage containers in North America in 2018, which represented approximately 44 percent of the aggregate production in these countries. Historically, sales volumes of metal beverage containers in North America tend to be highest during the period from April through September. All of the beverage containers produced by Ball in the U.S., Canada and Mexico are made of aluminum. In North and Central America, five suppliers provide the majority of our aluminum can and end sheet requirements.
     Beverage containers are sold based on price, quality, service, innovation and sustainability in a highly competitive market, which is relatively capital intensive and characterized by facilities that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably. In addition, the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials which include meaningful industry positions by the glass bottle in the packaged beer industry and the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle in the carbonated soft drink and water industries.
     We believe we have limited our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments.
     Our beverage can manufacturing facility in Reidsville, North Carolina, ceased production at the end of June 2017, the Birmingham, Alabama, facility ceased production during the second quarter of 2018 and the Chatsworth, California, and Longview, Texas, facilities ceased production during the third quarter of 2018. These facilities produced beverage cans in a variety of sizes and their customers are now supplied by the company’s other U.S. facilities. 
     Beverage Packaging, South America, Segment
     The beverage packaging, South America, segment accounted for 15 percent of Ball’s consolidated net sales in 2018. Our operations consist of 12 facilities, 10 in Brazil and one each in Argentina and Chile. For the countries where we operate, the South American beverage container market is approximately 31 billion containers, and we are the largest producer in this region with an estimated 53 percent of South American shipments in 2018. Four companies currently manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in Brazil. 
     The company’s South American beverage facilities produced approximately 16 billion aluminum beverage containers in 2018. Historically, sales volumes of beverage containers in South America tend to be highest during the period from September through December. In South America, two suppliers provide virtually all our aluminum sheet requirements with certain requirements also being imported from Asia.

 In order to support contracted volumes for aluminum beverage packaging across Paraguay, Argentina, Chile and Bolivia, the company is constructing a one-line beverage can and end manufacturing facility in Paraguay and will add capacity to its Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Santiago, Chile, facilities. The Paraguay facility is expected to begin production in the second half of 2019.  The company ceased operations at its Cuiabá, Brazil, beverage packaging facility in July 2018 and has relocated equipment from the Cuiabá facility to other existing facilities in South America.
     We believe we have limited our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments.
     Beverage Packaging, Europe, Segment
     The beverage packaging, Europe, segment accounted for 23 percent of Ball’s consolidated net sales in 2018.  Our European operations consist of 20 facilities throughout Europe. The European beverage container market is approximately 67 billion containers, including Russia and excluding Turkey, and we are the largest producer with an estimated 43 percent of European shipments. The European market is highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix. Four companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in Europe. Our European beverage facilities produced 30 billion beverage containers in 2018, the vast majority of which were produced from aluminum. 
     Historically, sales volumes of metal beverage containers in Europe tend to be highest during the period from May through August with a smaller increase in demand leading up to the winter holiday season in the U.K. offset by much lower demand in Russia. Much like other parts of the world, the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the European beer and carbonated soft drink industries. The glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry, while the PET container is utilized in the carbonated soft drink, beer, juice and water industries.
     European raw material supply contracts generally have longer term agreements. In Europe, five aluminum suppliers and one steel supplier provide almost all of our requirements. Aluminum is traded primarily in U.S. dollars, while the functional currencies of our European operations are various other currencies. The company minimizes its exchange rate risk using derivative and supply contracts in local currencies. Purchase and sales contracts generally include fixed-price, floating or pass-through aluminum ingot component pricing arrangements.
     In order to support growth for beverage cans in the Iberian Peninsula, the company constructed a two-line, aluminum beverage can manufacturing facility near Madrid, Spain, with a majority of the facility’s capacity secured under a long-term customer contract. The facility is fully operational and produces multiple can sizes utilizing both lines. In the third quarter of 2017, our beverage packaging container and end production facilities in Recklinghausen, Germany, ceased production, and the capacity was transitioned to existing European Ball facilities.  In December 2018, we closed a one-line beverage packaging facility located in San Martino, Italy. 

 Aerospace Segment
     Ball’s aerospace segment, which accounted for 10 percent of consolidated net sales in 2018, includes national defense hardware, antenna and video tactical solutions, civil and operational space hardware and systems engineering services. The segment develops spacecraft, sensors and instruments, radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil, commercial and national security aerospace markets. The majority of the aerospace business involves work under contracts, generally from one to five years in duration, as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and other U.S. government agencies. The company competes against both large and small prime contractors and subcontractors for these contracts. Contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 99 percent of segment sales in 2018.
     Intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both the company’s business and the aerospace and defense industry. It is common in the aerospace and defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to a competitor, become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company. It is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and, simultaneously, perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts, or vice versa.

 Geopolitical events and shifting executive and legislative branch priorities have resulted in an increase in opportunities over the past decade in areas matching our aerospace segment’s core capabilities in space hardware. The businesses include hardware and services sold primarily to U.S. customers, with emphasis on space science and exploration, environmental and earth sciences, and defense and intelligence applications. Major activities frequently involve the design, manufacture and testing of satellites, remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software, as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations. 
 Other hardware activities include target identification, warning and attitude control systems and components; cryogenic systems for reactant storage, and associated sensor cooling devices; star trackers, which are general-purpose stellar attitude sensors; and fast-steering mirrors. Additionally, the aerospace segment provides diversified technical services and products to government agencies, prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare, electronic warfare, avionics, intelligence, training and space system needs.
     Contracted backlog in the aerospace segment was $2.2 billion and $1.75 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and consisted of the aggregate contract value of firm orders, excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue. The 2018 contracted backlog includes $1.1 billion expected to be recognized in revenues during 2019, with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues in the years thereafter. Unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders, which are subject to annual funding, were $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Year-over-year comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts, funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards. Uncertainties in the federal government budgeting process could delay the funding, or even result in cancellation of certain programs currently in our reported backlog.
     Other
     Other consists of  non-reportable segments located in Africa, Middle East and Asia (beverage packaging, AMEA) and Asia Pacific (beverage packaging, Asia Pacific) that manufacture and sell metal beverage containers; a non-reportable segment that manufactures and sells aerosol containers, extruded aluminum aerosol containers and aluminum slugs (aerosol packaging); undistributed corporate expenses; intercompany eliminations and other business activities.     Beverage Packaging, AMEA
     Our metal beverage container operations in the AMEA region consist of five aluminum container and end manufacturing facilities–two in India and one each in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The beverage container market in these regions produced 27 billion cans in 2018, and we are one of six major producers in this region with 15 percent of shipments. Our manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia, Rexam United Arab Can Manufacturing Limited, is a joint venture 51 percent owned by Ball and consolidated in our results. Additionally, Ball has an ownership interest in an equity method joint venture in South Korea.
