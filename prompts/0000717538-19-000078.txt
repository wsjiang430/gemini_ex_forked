Item 1. Business
A. GENERAL
Our holding company, Arrow Financial Corporation, a New York corporation, was incorporated on March 21, 1983 and is registered as a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. Arrow owns two nationally- chartered banks in New York (Glens Falls National and Saratoga National), and through such banks indirectly owns various non-

The holding company’s business consists primarily of the ownership, supervision and control of our two banks, including the banks' subsidiaries. The holding company provides various advisory and administrative services and coordinates the general policies and operation of the banks. There were 516 full-time equivalent employees, including 58 employees within our insurance agency affiliate, at December 31, 2018.
We offer a broad range of commercial and consumer banking and financial products. Our deposit base consists of deposits derived principally from the communities we serve. We target our lending activities to consumers and small- and mid-sized companies in our regional geographic area. In addition, through an indirect lending program we acquire consumer loans from an extensive network of automobile dealers that operate in a larger area of upstate New York, and in central and southern Vermont. Through our banks' trust operations, we provide retirement planning, trust and estate administration services for individuals, and pension, profit-sharing and employee benefit plan administration for corporations.
B. LENDING ACTIVITIES
Arrow engages in a wide range of lending activities, including commercial and industrial lending primarily to small and mid-sized companies; mortgage lending for residential and commercial properties; and consumer installment and home equity financing. We also maintain an active indirect lending program through our sponsorship of automobile dealer programs under which we purchase consumer auto loans, primarily from dealers that meet pre-established specifications. From time to time, we sell a portion of our residential real estate loan originations into the secondary market, primarily to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") and other governmental agencies. Normally, we retain the servicing rights on mortgage loans originated and sold by us into the secondary markets, subject to our periodic determinations on the continuing profitability of such activity. 
Generally, we continue to implement lending strategies and policies that are intended to protect the quality of the loan portfolio, including strong underwriting and collateral control procedures and credit review systems. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status either due to the delinquency status of principal and/or interest or a judgment by management that the full repayment of principal and interest is unlikely. Home equity lines of credit, secured by real property, are systematically placed on nonaccrual status when 120 days past due, and residential real estate loans when 150 days past due. Commercial and commercial real estate loans are evaluated on a loan-by-loan basis and are placed on nonaccrual status when 90 days past due if the full collection of principal and interest is uncertain. (See Part II, Item 7.C.II.c. "Risk Elements.") Subsequent cash payments on loans classified as nonaccrual may be applied all to principal, although income in some cases may be recognized on a cash basis.
We lend almost exclusively to borrowers within our normal retail service area in northeastern New York State, with the exception of our indirect consumer lending line of business, where we acquire retail paper from an extensive network of automobile dealers that operate in a larger area of upstate New York, and in central and southern Vermont. The loan portfolio does not include any foreign loans or any other significant risk concentrations. We do not generally participate in loan syndications, either as originator or as a participant. However, from time to time, we buy participations in individual loans, typically commercial loans, originated by other financial institutions in New York and adjacent states. In recent periods, the total dollar amount of such participations has fluctuated, but generally represents less than 20% of commercial loans outstanding. Most of the portfolio is fully collateralized, and many commercial loans are further supported by personal guarantees. 
We do not engage in subprime mortgage lending as a business line and we do not extend or purchase so-called "Alt A," "negative amortization," "option ARM's" or "negative equity" mortgage loans. 
C. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
The following generally describes the laws and regulations to which we are subject. Bank holding companies, banks and their affiliates are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. To the extent that the following information summarizes statutory or regulatory law, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular provisions of the various statutes and regulations. Any change in applicable law may have a material effect on our business operations, customers, prospects and investors.

Bank Regulatory Authorities with Jurisdiction over Arrow and its Subsidiary Banks
Arrow is a registered bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 ("BHC Act") and as such is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("FRB"). As a "bank holding company" under New York State law, Arrow is also subject to regulation by the New York State Department of Financial Services. Our two subsidiary banks are both national banks and are subject to supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"). The banks are members of the Federal Reserve System and the deposits of each bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). The BHC Act generally prohibits Arrow from engaging, directly or indirectly, in activities other than banking, activities closely related to banking, and certain other financial activities. Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company generally must obtain FRB approval before acquiring, directly or indirectly, voting shares of another bank or bank holding company, if after the acquisition the acquiror would own 5 percent or more of a class of the voting shares of that other bank or bank holding company. Bank holding companies are able to acquire banks or other bank holding companies located in all 50 states, subject to certain limitations. Bank holding companies that meet certain qualifications may choose to apply to the FRB for designation as "financial holding companies." If they obtain such designation, they will thereafter be eligible to acquire or otherwise affiliate with a much broader array of other financial institutions than "bank holding companies" are eligible to acquire or affiliate with, including insurance companies, investment banks and merchant banks. Arrow has not attempted to become, and has not been designated as, a financial holding company.
The FRB and the OCC have broad regulatory, examination and enforcement authority. The FRB and the OCC conduct regular examinations of the entities they regulate. In addition, banking organizations are subject to requirements for periodic reporting to the regulatory authorities.  The FRB and OCC have the authority to implement various remedies if they determine that the financial condition, capital, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity or other aspects of a banking organization's operations are unsatisfactory or if they determine the banking organization is violating or has violated any law or regulation. The authority of the federal bank regulators over banking organizations includes, but is not limited to, prohibiting unsafe or unsound practices; requiring affirmative action to correct a violation or unsafe or unsound practice; issuing administrative orders; requiring the organization to increase capital; requiring the organization to sell subsidiaries or other assets; restricting dividends, distributions and repurchases of the organization's stock; restricting the growth of the organization; assessing civil money penalties; removing officers and directors; and terminating deposit insurance. The FDIC may terminate a depository institution's deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution's financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices for certain other reasons. 
Regulatory Supervision of Other Arrow Subsidiaries
The insurance agency subsidiary of Glens Falls National is subject to the licensing and other provisions of New York State Insurance Law and is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services. Arrow's investment adviser subsidiary is subject to the licensing and other provisions of the federal Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and is regulated by the SEC.

Regulation of Transactions between Banks and their Affiliates
Transactions between banks and their "affiliates" are regulated by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (FRA). Each of our organization's non-bank subsidiaries (other than the business trusts we formed to issue our TRUPs) is a subsidiary of one of our banks, and also is an "operating subsidiary" under Sections 23A and 23B. This means the non-bank subsidiary is considered to be part of the bank that owns it and thus is not an affiliate of that bank for purposes of Section 23A and 23B. However, each of our two banks is an affiliate of the other bank, under Section 23A, and Arrow, the holding company, is also an affiliate of each bank under both Sections 23A and 23B. Extensions of credit that a bank may make to affiliates, or to third parties secured by securities or obligations of the affiliates, are substantially limited by the FRA and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA). Such acts further restrict the range of permissible transactions between a bank and any affiliate, including a bank affiliate. Furthermore, under the FRA, a bank may engage in certain transactions, including loans and purchases of assets, with a non-bank affiliate, only if certain special conditions, including collateral requirements for loans, are met and if the other terms and conditions of the transaction, including interest rates and credit standards, are substantially the same as, or at least as favorable to the bank as, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions by the bank with non-affiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and conditions that would be offered by the bank to non-affiliated companies.

Regulatory Capital Standards
An important area of banking regulation is the federal banking system's promulgation and enforcement of minimum capitalization standards for banks and bank holding companies. 
Bank Capital Rules. In July 2013, federal bank regulators, including the FRB and the OCC, approved their revised bank capital rules aimed at implementing capital requirements pursuant to Dodd-Frank. These rules were also intended to coordinate U.S. bank capital standards with the then-current drafts of the Basel III proposed bank capital standards for all of the developed world's banking organizations. The federal regulators' revised capital rules (the "Capital Rules"), which impose significantly higher minimum capital ratios on U.S. financial institutions than the rules they replaced, became effective for Arrow and its subsidiary banks on January 1, 2015, with full phase in by 2019. 
These Capital Rules consist of two basic types of capital measures, a leverage ratio and set of risk-based capital measures. Within these two broad types of rules, however, significant changes were made in the revised Capital Rules, as discussed as follows. 
# 6

Leverage Ratio. The Capital Rules increased the minimum required leverage ratio from 3.0% to 4.0%. The leverage ratio continues to be defined as the ratio of the institution's "Tier 1" capital (as defined under the new leverage rule) to total tangible assets (again, as defined under the revised leverage rule). 
Risk-Based Capital Measures. Risk-based capital measures assign various risk weightings to all of the institution's assets, by asset type, and to certain off balance sheet items, and then establish minimum levels of capital to the aggregate dollar amount of such risk-weighted assets. Under the risk-based Capital Rules, there are 8 major risk-weighted categories of assets (although there are several additional super-weighted categories for high-risk assets that are generally not held by community banking organizations like Arrow's). The Capital Rules include a measure called the "common equity tier 1 capital ratio" (CET1). For this ratio, only common equity (basically, common stock plus surplus plus retained earnings) qualifies as capital (i.e., CET1). Preferred stock and trust preferred securities, which qualified as Tier 1 capital under the old Tier 1 risk-based capital measure (and continue to qualify as capital under the revised Tier 1 risk-based capital measure), are not included in CET1 capital. Technically, under these rules, CET1 capital also includes most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), including unrealized securities gains and losses, as part of both total regulatory capital (numerator) and total assets (denominator). However, smaller banking organizations like Arrow's were given the opportunity to make a one-time irrevocable election to include or not to include certain elements of AOCI, most notably unrealized securities gains or losses. Arrow made such an election, i.e., not to include unrealized securities gains and losses in calculating our CET1 ratio under the Capital Rules. The minimum CET1 ratio under these rules, effective January 1, 2015, is 4.50%, which will remain constant throughout the phase-in period.
Consistent with the general theme of higher capital levels, the Capital Rules also increased the minimum ratio for Tier 1 risk-based capital from 4.0% to 6.0%, effective January 1, 2015. The minimum level for total risk-based capital under the Capital Rules remained at 8.0%. 
The Capital Rules incorporate a capital concept, the so-called "capital conservation buffer" (set at 2.5%, after full phase-in), which must be added to each of the minimum required risk-based capital ratios (i.e., the minimum CET1 ratio, the minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the minimum total risk-based capital ratio). The capital conservation buffer is being phased-in over four years beginning January 1, 2016 (see the table below). When, during economic downturns, an institution's capital begins to erode, the first deductions from a regulatory perspective would be taken against the conservation buffer. To the extent that such deductions should erode the buffer below the required level (2.5% of total risk-based assets after full phase-in), the institution will not necessarily be required to replace the buffer deficit immediately, but will face restrictions on paying dividends and other negative consequences until the buffer is fully replenished. 
Also under the Capital Rules, and as required under Dodd-Frank, TRUPs issued by small- to medium-sized banking organizations (such as Arrow) that were outstanding on the Dodd-Frank grandfathering date for TRUPS (May 19, 2010) will continue to qualify as tier 1 capital, up to a limit of 25% of tier 1 capital, until the TRUPs mature or are redeemed, subject to certain limitations. See the discussion of grandfathered TRUPs in Section E ("CAPITAL RESOURCES AND DIVIDENDS") of Item 7.
The following is a summary of the definitions of capital under the various risk-based measures in the Capital Rules:
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (CET1): Equals the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus (net of treasury stock), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), and qualifying minority interests, minus applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Such deductions will include AOCI, if the organization has exercised its irrevocable option not to include AOCI in capital (Arrow made such an election). Mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets, and investments in financial institutions are limited to 15% of CET1 in the aggregate and 10% of CET1 for each such item individually. 
Additional Tier 1 Capital: Equals the sum of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, tier 1 minority interests, grandfathered TRUPs, and Troubled Asset Relief Program instruments, minus applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. 
Tier 2 Capital: Equals the sum of subordinated debt and preferred stock, total capital minority interests not included in Tier 1, and allowance for loan and lease losses (not exceeding 1.25% of risk-weighted assets) minus applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions.
 The following table presents the transition schedule applicable to Arrow and its subsidiary banks under the Capital Rules:

Year, as of January 1 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019
Minimum CET1 Ratio | 4.500 | % | 4.500 | % | 4.500 | % | 4.500 | %
Capital Conservation Buffer ("Buffer") | 0.625 | % | 1.250 | % | 1.875 | % | 2.500 | %
Minimum CET1 Ratio Plus Buffer | 5.125 | % | 5.750 | % | 6.375 | % | 7.000 | %
Minimum Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio | 6.000 | % | 6.000 | % | 6.000 | % | 6.000 | %
Minimum Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio Plus Buffer | 6.625 | % | 7.250 | % | 7.875 | % | 8.500 | %
Minimum Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio | 8.000 | % | 8.000 | % | 8.000 | % | 8.000 | %
Minimum Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio Plus Buffer | 8.625 | % | 9.250 | % | 9.875 | % | 10.500 | %
Minimum Leverage Ratio | 4.000 | % | 4.000 | % | 4.000 | % | 4.000 | %


These minimum capital ratios, especially the CET1 ratio (4.5%) and the enhanced Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (6.0%), which began to apply to the Company on January 1, 2015, represent a heightened and more restrictive capital regime than institutions previously had to meet, and the four year phase-in of the regulatory capital buffer, which began January 1, 2016, will add to the stress on the Company's profitability. 
# 7

At December 31, 2018, Arrow and its two subsidiary banks exceeded by a substantial amount each of the applicable minimum capital ratios established under the revised Capital Rules, including the minimum CET1 Ratio, the minimum Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, the minimum Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, and the minimum Leverage Ratio, and including in the case of each risk-based ratio, the phased-in portion of the capital buffer. See Note 19, Regulatory Matters, to the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a presentation of our period-end ratios for 2018 and 2017.
In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the "Economic Growth Act") , was enacted to modify or remove certain legal requirements, including some requirements related to capital standards implemented under Dodd-Frank. While the Economic Growth Act maintains much of the regulatory structure established by Dodd-Frank, it amends certain aspects of that regulatory framework, including certain capital requirements. These Economic Growth Act changes could result in meaningful regulatory relief regarding capital standards for community banking organizations, such as Arrow's. See the discussion of this item under "2018 Regulatory Reform."

Regulatory Capital Classifications. Under applicable banking law, federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The regulators have established five capital classifications for banking institutions, ranging from the highest category of "well-capitalized" to the lowest category of "critically under-capitalized". Under the Capital Rules, a banking institution is considered "well-capitalized" if it meets the following capitalization standards on the date of measurement: a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.50% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.00% or greater, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.00% or greater, provided the institution is not subject to any regulatory order or written directive regarding capital maintenance. 
As of December 31, 2018, Arrow and its two subsidiary banks qualified as "well-capitalized" under the revised capital classification scheme.
2018 Regulatory Reform. The Economic Growth Act was signed into law May 24, 2018. Some of its provisions were written to take effect immediately; others have later specified effective dates and still others are open-ended, to be implemented by rule-making. This legislation includes a variety of provisions that are intended to affect community banking institutions such as Arrow, including the following: 

• | The federal bank regulatory agencies are directed to establish a "community bank leverage ratio" ("CBLR") of between 8% and 10%, calculated by dividing tangible equity capital by average total consolidated assets of "qualifying community banks" that meet certain requirements to be set by those regulatory agencies. A qualifying community bank is a depository institution or bank holding company with less than $10 billion in total assets that meets other requirements to be established by the regulators. If a qualifying community bank exceeds the community bank leverage ratio, it will be deemed to have met all applicable capital and leverage requirements, including the generally applicable leverage capital requirements and risk-based capital requirements and (if the community bank is a depository institution) the "well capitalized" requirement under the federal "prompt corrective action" capital standards. This new community bank leverage ratio is intended to reduce the burden of compliance with regard to regulatory capital adequacy for qualifying community banks. However, this alternative capital standard will not be effective until the federal bank regulatory authorities adopt rules for its implementation. 


• | The definition of "high volatility commercial real estate" loans that trigger heightened risk-based capital requirements, has been modified and limited to ease the burden of those requirements.


• | The total asset threshold for qualifying insured financial institutions eligible for an 18-month examination cycle has been increased from $1 billion to $3 billion.


• | The new law provides that reciprocal deposits of certain institutions shall not be considered "brokered deposits," subject to certain limitations.


• | Some community banks will be exempt from mortgage escrow requirements, and an expanded "qualified mortgage" exemption for community banks has been implemented to ease the burden of the "ability to repay" requirements in the Truth in Lending Act.


• | Financial institutions with less than $10 billion in total assets that meet certain requirements will be exempt from the Volcker Rule proprietary trading requirements implemented under the Dodd Frank Act.

On November 21, 2018, federal banking regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which defines a qualifying “community bank” to include banks or bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion in addition to other qualifications. The proposed rule would set the threshold for the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR) at greater than 9 percent, calculated as the ratio of “CBLR tangible equity” divided by “average total consolidated assets.” Based on the parameters of this proposed rulemaking, the CBLR for Arrow and both subsidiary banks is estimated to exceed the 9 percent threshold. However, these proposed rules are not yet final, and the terms of the rules may change before becoming final. Upon effectiveness, the final rules may impact Arrow’s capital options and requirements, although the potential impact of the final rules on Arrow will remain uncertain until those final rules are issued.  Until those rules become final, the enhanced bank capital standards promulgated under Dodd-Frank will remain applicable to Arrow.
Dividend Restrictions; Other Regulatory Sanctions
A holding company's ability to pay dividends or repurchase its outstanding stock, as well as its ability to expand its business, including for example, through acquisitions of additional banking organizations or permitted non-bank companies, may be restricted if its capital falls below minimum regulatory capital ratios or fails to meet other informal capital guidelines that the regulators may apply from time to time to specific banking organizations. In addition to these potential regulatory limitations on payment of dividends, our holding company's ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, and our subsidiary banks' ability to pay dividends to our holding 
# 8

company are also subject to various restrictions under applicable corporate laws, including banking laws (which affect our subsidiary banks) and the New York Business Corporation Law (which affects our holding company). The ability of our holding company and banks to pay dividends or repurchase shares in the future is, and is expected to continue to be, influenced by regulatory policies, the Capital Rules and other applicable law.
In cases where banking regulators have significant concerns regarding the financial condition, assets or operations of a bank holding company or one of its banks, the regulators may take enforcement action or impose enforcement orders, formal or informal, against the holding company or the particular bank. If the ratio of tangible equity to total assets of a bank falls to 2% or below, the bank will likely be closed and placed in receivership, with the FDIC as receiver.
Cybersecurity
In addition to the provisions in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act relating to data security (discussed below), Arrow and its subsidiaries are subject to many federal and state laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations which impose standards and requirements related to cybersecurity. For example, in February 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued the "Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures" to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents. With the increased frequency and magnitude of cybersecurity incidents, the SEC indicated that it is critical that public companies take all required actions to inform investors about material cybersecurity risks and incidents in a timely fashion. Additionally, in October 2018 the SEC issued the "Report of Investigation Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Regarding Certain Cyber-Related Frauds Perpetrated Against Public Companies and Related Internal Controls Requirements" which cited business email compromises that led to the incidents and that internal accounting controls may need to be reassessed in light of these emerging risks.
In March 2015, federal regulators issued related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. Financial institutions that fail to observe this regulatory guidance on cybersecurity may be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. 
Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC
Under the Patriot Act and other federal anti-money laundering law, financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures, and controls. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and customer identification. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions. Law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution's compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications, including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions. The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or "OFAC," is responsible for helping to insure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations, and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If Arrow finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, Arrow must freeze or block such account or transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities. The U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crises Enforcement Network ("FinCEN") issued a final rule in 2016 increasing customer due diligence requirements for banks, including adding a requirement to identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners of customers that are legal entities, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions. The Company has established procedures for compliance with these requirements.
The USA Patriot Act
The USA Patriot Act, initially adopted in 2001 and re-adopted by the U.S. Congress in 2006 with certain changes (the "Patriot Act"), imposes substantial record-keeping and due diligence obligations on banks and other financial institutions, with a particular focus on detecting and reporting money-laundering transactions involving domestic or international customers. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued and will continue to issue regulations clarifying the Patriot Act's requirements. The Patriot Act requires all financial institutions, including banks, to maintain certain anti-money laundering compliance, customer identification and due diligence programs. Compliance with the provisions of the Patriot Act results in substantial costs on all financial institutions.
Reserve Requirements
Pursuant to regulations of the FRB, all banking organizations are required to maintain average daily reserves at mandated ratios against their transaction accounts and certain other types of deposit accounts. These reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in an account at a Federal Reserve Bank.
# 9

Community Reinvestment Act
Arrow's subsidiary banks are subject to the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") and implementing regulations. CRA regulations establish the framework and criteria by which the bank regulatory agencies assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its community, including low and moderate-income individuals. CRA ratings are taken into account by regulators in reviewing certain applications made by Arrow and its bank subsidiaries.
Privacy and Confidentiality Laws
Arrow and its subsidiaries are subject to a variety of laws that regulate customer privacy and confidentiality. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires financial institutions to adopt privacy policies, to restrict the sharing of nonpublic customer information with nonaffiliated parties upon the request of the customer, and to implement data security measures to protect customer information. Certain state laws may impose additional privacy and confidentiality restrictions. The Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, regulates use of credit reports, providing of information to credit reporting agencies and sharing of customer information with affiliates, and sets identity theft prevention standards.
The Dodd-Frank Act
Dodd-Frank significantly changed the regulatory structure for financial institutions and their holding companies, for example, through provisions requiring the Capital Rules. Among other provisions, Dodd-Frank implemented corporate governance revisions that apply to all public companies, not just financial institutions and permanently increased the FDIC’s standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000, changed the FDIC insurance assessment base to assets rather than deposits and increased the reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund to ensure the future strength of the fund. The federal prohibition on the payment of interest on certain demand deposits was repealed, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction accounts. Dodd-Frank established a new federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), centralizing significant aspects of consumer financial protection under this agency. Limits were imposed for debit card interchange fees for issuers that have assets greater than $10 billion, which also could affect the amount of interchange fees collected by financial institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. Dodd-Frank also imposed new requirements related to mortgage lending, including prohibitions against payment of steering incentives and provisions relating to underwriting standards, disclosures, appraisals and escrows. The Volcker Rule prohibited banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in certain unregistered investment companies.
Federal banking regulators and other agencies including, among others, the FRB, the OCC and the CFPB, have been engaged in extensive rule-making efforts under Dodd-Frank, and the 2018 Economic Growth Act has impacted certain Dodd-Frank requirements, as explained above. 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 implemented a broad range of corporate governance, accounting and reporting requirements for companies that have securities registered under the Exchange Act. These requirements included: (1) requirements for audit committees, including independence and financial expertise; (2) certification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the reporting company; (3) standards for auditors and regulation of audits; (4) disclosure and reporting requirements for the reporting company and directors and executive officers; and (5) a range of civil and criminal penalties for fraud and other violations of securities laws.
Incentive Compensation
Dodd-Frank required the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, such as the Company, having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. 
The federal bank regulators issued proposed rules to address incentive-based compensation arrangements in June 2016. Final rules have not yet been issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies under this Dodd-Frank provision.
In 2010, the FRB, OCC and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. Management believes the current and past compensation practices of the Company do not encourage excessive risk taking or undermine the safety and soundness of the organization.
The FRB will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation 
# 10

arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.

Deposit Insurance Laws and Regulations
In February 2011, the FDIC finalized a new assessment system that took effect in the second quarter of 2011. The final rule changed the assessment base from domestic deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity, adopted a new large-bank pricing assessment scheme, and set a target size for the Deposit Insurance Fund. The changes went into effect in the second quarter of 2011. The rule (as mandated by Dodd-Frank) finalizes a target size for the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio at 2.0% of insured deposits. It also implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the ratio reaches 1.15% (so that the average rate over time should be about 8.5 basis points) and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 2.0% and 2.5%. 
In August 2016, the FDIC announced that the reserve ratio reached 1.17% at the end of June 2016. This represents the highest level the ratio has reached in more than eight years. The reduction in assessment rates went into effect in the third quarter of 2016. We are unable to predict whether or to what extent the FDIC may elect to impose additional special assessments on insured institutions in upcoming years, if bank failures should once again become a significant problem.
In January 2019, both of the Company's banking subsidiaries received preliminary notification of eligibility for small bank assessment credits. These credits are related to the Deposit Insurance Recovery Fund Reserve Ratio reaching 1.36% and may reduce the banks' future quarterly assessments. 
D. RECENT LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS
Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”)
In May 2018, the Economic Growth Act, was enacted to modify or remove certain legal requirements, including some requirements imposed under Dodd-Frank. While the Economic Growth Act maintains much of the regulatory structure established by Dodd-Frank, it amends certain aspects of that regulatory framework . Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory relief for community banking organizations, such as Arrow's. 
Health Care Reform
Various proposals have been discussed for consideration that would substantially modify various health care laws. At present, we are not able to estimate the likelihood of adoption of any such provisions or the potential impact thereof if adopted. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Act")
On December 22, 2017, Tax Act was enacted. A number of provisions have impacted us including the following:

• | Tax Rate. The Tax Act replaced the graduated corporate tax rates applicable under prior law, which imposed a maximum tax rate of 35%, with a reduced 21% tax rate. This reduction will generally result in future increased earnings and capital and reduced our net deferred tax liability. Generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires that the impact of the provisions of the Tax Act be accounted for in the period of enactment. Accordingly, a benefit of $1.1 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 which represents the impact of the re-measurement of net deferred tax liabilities. 


• | Employee Compensation. A publicly held corporation is not permitted to deduct compensation in excess of $1 million per year paid to certain employees. The Tax Act eliminates certain exceptions to the $1 million limit applicable under prior law related to performance-based compensation, such as equity grants and cash bonuses that are paid only on the attainment of performance goals. Based on our current compensation plans, we do not expect to be impacted by this limitation. 


• | Interest Expense. The Tax Act limits a taxpayer's annual deduction of business interest expense to the sum of (i) business interest income and (ii) 30% of "adjusted taxable income," defined as business's taxable income without taking into account business interest income or expense, net operating losses, and, for 2018 through 2021, depreciation, amortization and depletion. Because we generate significant amounts of net interest income, we do not expect to be impacted by this limitation. 

The foregoing description of the impact of the Tax Act on us should be read in conjunction with Note 15, Income Taxes, of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other Legislative Initiatives 
From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory authorities. These initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to change the financial institution regulatory environment. Such legislation could change banking laws and the operating environment of our Company in substantial, but unpredictable ways. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations would have on our financial condition or results of operations.

F. COMPETITION
We face intense competition in all markets we serve. Competitors include traditional local commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions, non-traditional internet-based lending alternatives, as well as local offices of major regional and money center banks. Like all banks, we encounter strong competition in the mortgage lending space from a wide variety of other mortgage originators, all of whom are principally affected in this business by the rate and terms set, and the lending practices established from time-to-time by the very large government sponsored enterprises ("GSEs") engaged in residential mortgage lending, most importantly, “Fannie Mae” and “Freddie Mac.” For many years, these GSEs have purchased and/or guaranteed a very substantial percentage of all newly-originated mortgage loans in the U.S.. Additionally, non-banking financial organizations, such as consumer finance companies, insurance companies, securities firms, money market funds, mutual funds, credit card companies and wealth management enterprises offer substantive equivalents of the various other types of loan and financial products and services and transactional accounts that we offer, even though these non-banking organizations are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions and capital requirements that apply to us. Under federal banking laws, such non-banking financial organizations not only may offer products and services comparable to those offered by commercial banks, but also may establish or acquire their own commercial banks.
