Our Company 
 
Overview 
 
Second Sight Medical Products, Inc. (NASDAQ: EYES) develops, manufactures and markets implantable visual prosthetics that are intended to deliver useful artificial vision to blind individuals. We are a recognized global leader in neuromodulation devices for blindness, and are committed to developing new technologies to treat the broadest population of sight-impaired individuals.
 
Leveraging our 20 years of experience in neuromodulation for vision, we are developing the Orion® Visual Cortical Prosthesis System (“Orion”), an implanted cortical stimulation device intended to provide useful artificial vision to individuals who are blind due to a wide range of causes, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, optic nerve injury or disease and eye injury. Orion is intended to convert images captured by a miniature video camera mounted on glasses into a series of small electrical pulses. The device is designed to bypass diseased or injured eye anatomy and to transmit these electrical pulses wirelessly to an array of electrodes implanted on the surface of the brain’s visual cortex, where it is intended to provide the perception of patterns of light. A six-subject early feasibility study of the Orion device is currently underway at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles (“UCLA”) and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston (“Baylor”). No published in-human data is available yet for the Orion system. We anticipate enrolling additional feasibility subjects in 2019 while simultaneously negotiating the clinical and regulatory pathway to commercialization with the FDA as part of the Breakthrough Devices Program. 
 
       Our principal offices are located in Los Angeles, California. We also have an office in Lausanne, Switzerland, that manages our commercial and clinical operations in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
        Our current product, the Argus ® II Retinal Prosthesis System (“Argus II”), treats outer retinal degenerations, such as retinitis pigmentosa, also referred to as RP. RP is a hereditary disease, affecting an estimated 1.5 million people worldwide including about 100,000 people in the United States, that causes a progressive degeneration of the light-sensitive cells of the retina, leading to significant visual impairment and ultimately blindness. The Argus II is the only retinal prosthesis approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), and was the first approved retinal prosthesis in the world. A subset of these patients would be eligible for the Argus II since the approved baseline vision for the Argus II is worse than legally blind (20/200). We commissioned 3rd party market research to estimate the size of the RP market that resulted in an estimate of approximately 1,500 patients in the US with advanced RP that could be treated with the Argus II given the eligibility criteria of our label.
 
The Argus II system provides an artificial form of vision that differs from the vision of people with normal sight. It does not restore normal vision and there is no evidence that it can slow or reverse the progression of the disease. The majority of patients receive a significant benefit from the Argus II, however results can vary and some patients report receiving little or no benefit. By creating an artificial form of useful vision in patients who otherwise have total sight loss, the Argus II can provide benefits that include: 
 
 
● | restoring independence through a renewed ability to navigate independently in unfamiliar environments;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improving patients’ orientation and mobility, such as locating doors and windows, avoiding obstacles, and following the lines of a crosswalk;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | allowing patients to feel more connected with people in their surroundings, such as seeing when someone is approaching or moving away;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | providing patients with enjoyment from being “visual” again, such as locating the moon, tracking groups of players as they move around a field, and watching moving streams of lights from fireworks;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | enabling some patients to re-enter the workforce through multiple vocations that become possible because of Argus II; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improving patients’ well-being and ability to perform activities of daily living.

We began selling the Argus II System in Europe at the end of 2011, Saudi Arabia in 2012, the United States and Canada in 2014, Turkey in 2015, Iran, Taiwan, South Korea and Russia in 2017, and Singapore in 2018. Given the limited addressable market of Argus II, we made the decision in 2018 to maximize capital efficiency with our Argus commercial and clinical activities and increase our investment of resources with our Orion clinical and R&D programs. In October 2018, we announced a restructuring of our international commercial activities and personnel. This restructuring resulted in a decision to no longer support new implants of Argus II in Turkey, Iran, Singapore and Russia.  We retained a team that continues to support existing Argus II patients and Centers of Excellence in the remaining international markets. We anticipate that the annual savings from the restructuring will amount to approximately $3.0 million per year and we plan to reallocate savings to the Orion program and other related projects. We recognized approximately $0.6 million of pre-tax restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 in connection with this restructuring, consisting of severance and other employee termination benefits, substantially all of which were settled in cash during the fourth quarter of 2018.
 We will continue to monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of commercial activities for Argus II and make further changes as needed to ensure sufficient payback on commercial spending while maximizing capital available to support Orion programs.
 We are actively developing multiple technologies that we believe to be complimentary to artificial vision and could potentially provide significant enhancements to the the Argus II or Orion user experience.  In most cases, we collaborate with 3rd party firms to advance and integrate these innovative technologies with our artificial vision systems.  Examples of technologies that are currently researching include: eye tracking, object recognition and localization, thermal imaging and depth-based decluttering.  We expect to advance several of these technologies to the point having prototype eyewear suitable for clinical testing in 2019.
 
Currently, after more than 20 years of research and development, more than $200 million of investment and over $34 million of grants awarded in support of our technology development, we employ over 120 people in the development (research, engineering and clinical), manufacture, and commercialization of the Argus II System and future products such as Orion.
 
Our Technology 
 
Both the Orion and Argus II systems work by converting video images captured by a miniature camera housed in a patient’s glasses into a series of small electrical pulses that are transmitted wirelessly to an array of electrodes.  The array is implanted on the visual cortex of brain with the Orion system bypassing the eye and optic nerve and directly stimulating the region of the brain responsible for vision.  The array is implanted on the surface of the retina with the Argus II system and directly stimulates the retina to bypass degenerated photoreceptor cells and to stimulate remaining viable retinal cells. The pulses generated by both systems are intended to create a perception of patterns of light in the brain. Following the implant surgery, patients learn to interpret these visual patterns as artificial vision, allowing them to detect shapes of people and objects in their surroundings. 
 
We believe both the Orion system and Argus II system (including their implantable components) possess several unique technological advancements compared to other neurostimulation devices including a hermetic package with the smallest size and largest number of individually programmable electrodes, and a patented electrode material that allows high charge densities and small electrode size. Several other engineering challenges, including device reliability, extended lifetime, and a safe and effective bio-interface, were overcome during the development of the products and these solutions have been protected both by patents and by trade secrets. Most of the technology developed for Argus II is also used in Orion. As of December 31, 2018, we have over 380 issued patents and approximately 58 pending patent applications worldwide. Additionally, from a competitive standpoint, the Argus II System possesses attractive technical and other features that include:
 
 
● | a unique patented design that allows for a demonstrated lifetime and benefit of over 10.7 years,


● | surgical implantation that can be performed in three to four hours using standard vitreoretinal techniques,


● | a relatively large field of view (20 degrees),


● | implanted patients can undergo MRI procedures, and


● | individually programmable electrodes on the prosthesis which can permit further optimization of the device after implantation.

We have demonstrated the ability to design products with long-term reliability. The Argus I retinal prosthesis, a proof of concept device that was a predecessor to the Argus II, was implanted in six patients in the United States. Argus I patients were implanted an average of almost six years, with one patient having used the device for over 10 years. The Argus II System has been implanted in over 300 patients. The average implant duration for these patients is nearly four years with several users continuing to use the system 10 years following implantation.
 
In November 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Devices Program designation for the Orion. This designation is given to a few select medical devices in order to provide more effective treatment of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions. This program is intended to help patients have more timely access to these medical devices by expediting their development, assessment, and review. With this designation, we believe the Orion will have the following advantages during the FDA review process:
 
 
● | More interactive review both for the Investigational Device Exemption and Premarket Approval application; 
● | Greater reliance on post-market data collection and greater acceptance of uncertainty in the benefit-risk profile at the time of approval;
● | Priority review (i.e., review of the submission is placed at the top of the review queue and receives additional review resources); and, 
● | Senior FDA management involvement and assignment of a cross-disciplinary case manager. 

 
It is our belief that inclusion in the Breakthrough Devices Program may shorten the timeline required to bring the Orion to market as a commercial product. We are currently evaluating our pivotal trial design for Orion and expect to reach consensus with the FDA on design specifics during early 2019. Major elements of our clinical trial design include the number of patients, study duration, and the endpoints suitable for assessing visual function, functional vision, and quality of life. While negotiations with the FDA are ongoing, we believe the study design will require a minimum sample population of 30 subjects with at least 6 months of follow-up data for each patient prior to submittal of a premarket approval (PMA) application.
 
Our Markets 
 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO)1, 253 million people suffer from moderate to severe vision impairment worldwide. Of these, 36 million people are considered legally blind. The WHO further estimates that 80% of legal blindness is avoidable, leaving 7.8 million legally blind individuals, including those blind due to AMD and RP, or 5.8 million excluding AMD and RP. In the US, 1.3 million people are legally blind2, of whom we estimate 44%, or 575,900, are legally blind due to causes other than preventable/treatable conditions, RP or AMD3. We estimate 1.13 million individuals are legally blind in Europe due to causes other than currently treatable conditions (including RP) or AMD.
 

Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) 
 
RP is a group of inherited disorders that affect the retina. The retina is a layer of nerve cells at the back of the eye. RP is a disease that gradually robs relatively young people of their vision over time. Onset of RP is often noted in the teen years or early twenties, typically as night blindness. This is followed by a period of peripheral vision loss, until the patient is left with a tunnel of vision and then no remaining sight. Although there are various genetic causes (over 100) and thus variability in the disease progression, many people with advanced RP have lost all functional vision by their 40s or 50s. The Argus II System, bypasses rods and cones which are largely defunct in these patients, by sending electrical signals directly to the retina’s remaining healthy cells.
 
Although there are reported trials for other treatments underway, to our knowledge the Argus II System remains the only approved therapeutic option for end-stage RP in the US, and to our knowledge it is the only treatment option generally available to commercial patients anywhere in the world. 
 

5

Worldwide, an estimated 1.5 million people suffer from RP4, which includes about 100,000 in the US5. Pan-European data is not readily available, but we believe it is reasonable to estimate that the average prevalence throughout Europe is similar to the average prevalence within the US, and so the ratio of populations could be used to estimate the number of Europeans affected as 167,000 in the 28 EU countries6,7.  Approximately 25% of people with RP in the US have vision that is 20/200 or worse (legally blind)8. Since the bare light perception or worse vision criterion (in both eyes) for the US indication is worse than 20/200, we estimate the subset of patients that can be treated by the Argus II System is less than 25,000 in the US. Reliable market data estimating the actual number of patients with bare light perception or worse vision is unavailable. We believe the majority of patients with vision 20/200 or worse have vision that is better than bare light perception and thus, are not currently candidates for Argus II. In Europe, the indicated vision loss for Argus II patients is severe to profound which, while better than bare light perception, remains somewhat worse than 20/200. An estimated 42,000 patients in Europe with RP have vision worse than 20/200 and we estimate the subset of RP patients that can be treated in Europe to be somewhat smaller than this number. As in the US, reliable market data estimating the actual number of patients with severe to profound vision loss or worse is unavailable. We believe that the majority of patients with vision 20/200 or worse in Europe have vision that is too good to be considered a candidate for Argus II with current clinical indications and physician practice. Worldwide, we estimate that 375,000 people are legally blind due to RP. A subset of these patients would be eligible for the Argus II since the approved baseline vision for the Argus II is worse than legally blind (20/200). We commissioned 3rd party market research to estimate the size of the RP market that resulted in an estimate of approximately 1,500 patients in the US with advanced RP that could be treated with the Argus II given the eligibility criteria of our label.

Other diseases resulting in blindness that may be treated by Orion 
 
We commissioned 3rd party market research for the potential market for Orion that resulted in initial estimates of over 500,000 individuals in the US who are legally blind due to glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, optic nerve disease and eye injury. Of this population, the potential US addressable market is more than 70,000 individuals with vision defined as bare light or no light perception. Our marketing approvals by the FDA and other regulatory agencies will ultimately determine the subset of these patients who are eligible for the Orion. 
 Many other diseases can also cause blindness. Many of the largest causes of visual impairment (i.e. refractive error and cataracts) are avoidable or curable, and their prolonged or untreated impact on vision is largely observed in developing nations and are not part of our target market. Some other causes of blindness, such as brain trauma to the visual cortex, may also not be suitable for treatment by a cortical stimulator. However, the remaining causes of severe vision loss which include glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, eye trauma, optic nerve disease or injury and many others can result in severe visual impairment that could potentially be treatable by an Orion visual prosthesis system.
 
We believe that, if approved by the FDA, the Orion will initially treat a subset of these legally blind individuals, likely starting with the ones who are completely blind. If this is the case, we anticipate that if we are further able to collect additional clinical data demonstrating the efficacy of the Orion for patients with better vision, we will be able to expand the approved indications and addressable market of the Orion to include a larger subset of these 5.8 million individuals for whom no effective treatment currently exists.

Our Strategy 
 
Our strategy can be summarized as follows:
 
 
● | Leverage proven Argus technology to develop the Orion visual cortical stimulator and significantly expand our addressable market to include a portion of the almost 6 million patients who are blind from eye trauma, optic nerve disease and injury, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and other untreatable causes,


● | Invest in research and development of technologies intended to enhance the Argus or Orion user experience including eye tracking, distance filtering/decluttering, object and facial recognition and thermal imaging, 
● | Maintain an emphasis on capital efficiency with Argus II commercial activities by focusing on key markets and centers of excellence in those markets. The goal is ultimately a positive cash contribution to the company that supports continued investment in Orion programs.

   Commercial Overview and Centers of Excellence Strategy in US 
 

As of December 31, 2018, we have 20 qualified centers in the United States and Canada that are actively implanting the Argus II. Outside of North America we are focusing on 14 active centers in 6 countries between Europe and Asia Pacific. 
 
To date, we have employed direct sales and vision rehabilitation specialists to service our markets in the US and Canada.  The majority of our markets in Europe are also serviced by a direct sales and vision specialist team. As of January 31, 2019, the sales/vision specialist team for North America numbered seven persons and the sales team for Europe and Asia Pacific numbered seven persons.  
 
Our COE strategy in the US market is designed to help our exclusive regional partners to more effectively manage Argus II patients and achieve inspiring patient outcomes. The COE strategy consists of four major initiatives: (1) financial, (2) patient recruitment, education and screening, (3) post-surgery programming, and (4) patient support and artificial vision rehabilitation.
 
 
● | First, there are the financial considerations. As reported, effective January 1, 2019 the CMS hospital outpatient final rule assigned an average payment rate of $152,500 for the Argus II and the associated surgical procedure beginning January 1, 2019. The rate for calendar years 2018, 2017, 2016 was $122,500, $150,000 and $95,000, respectively. Physician fees continue to be reimbursed separately. We expect that our current pricing strategy should generally ensure full reimbursement coverage of hospital surgical procedure costs including the Argus II system. Effective July 1, 2017, CPT codes for post-surgery programming became available. We believe that these developments ought to ensure a favorable economic analysis for any center evaluating an Argus II program. 


● | Second, regarding patient recruitment, education and screening, we focus extensive outreach efforts to identify those blind individuals who may qualify for Argus II. When identified those individuals are entered into a CRM database, supported by interactive marketing automation programs, with the intent of providing a funnel of patients for each of our strategic sites as patient candidates decide to move forward. We separately clear patient candidates with a team of experienced healthcare professionals, providing our COEs with a streamlined path of higher probability patient candidates. 


● | Third, in terms of the post-surgery programming, our recent and future product improvements are aimed at simplifying the programming procedure for the site and for the patient. We’ve reduced the expected time to program our system from two days down to a half day. As with the surgery, repetition will make the programming more routine for the institution. Further, as mentioned above, we have secured CPT codes to allow sites to submit for reimbursement when they program an Argus system.


● | Fourth, patient support and artificial vision rehabilitation are an important tool to managing consistent, positive outcomes across all treated patients. Beginning on day-one of initial activation, the brain works to make sense of the entirely new sensory input from Argus. Each individual patient needs guidance on the activities and tasks he or she can engage in, especially early on, that can best guide the brain to create these important new connections. As we have come to understand the important training curriculum of artificial vision rehabilitation, we are deploying today full-time vision rehabilitation specialists who are experts in all the ways Argus has enabled patients to: regain independence with the world around them; enhance social interactions with the people they associate with; and to enjoy the many aesthetic experiences that derive from visual interactivity. Our objective is to deliver outstanding patient outcomes, while building the know-how and infrastructure of vision rehabilitation for a substantially larger patient population in the near future. 

 
In summary, the aim of the COE program is to establish implanting centers and physician clinics that are more intimately knowledgeable, self-sufficient, and confident, enabling them to be able to treat a higher volume of artificial vision patients. We believe the COE program is the ideal platform for the important development work to serve the expanded patient populations in the near future.

Global Reimbursement 
 
Obtaining reimbursement from governmental and private insurance companies is critical to our commercial success. Due to the cost of the Argus II System, our sales would be limited without the availability of third party reimbursement. In the US, coding, coverage, and payment are necessary for the surgical procedure and Argus II system to be reimbursed by payers. Coding has been established for the device and the surgical procedure. Coverage and payment vary by payer. The majority of Argus II patients are eligible for Medicare, and coverage is primarily provided through traditional Medicare, sometimes referred to as Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) or Medicare Advantage. A small percentage of patients are covered by commercial insurers.

● | Medicare FFS patients – Coverage is determined by Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) that administer various geographic regions of the US. Positive coverage decisions for the Argus II are effective in eight of 12 MAC jurisdictions (comprising 31 states, two territories and the District of Columbia). Effective January 1, 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) established a 2019 average payment rate of $152,500 for both the procedure and the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System.


● | Medicare Advantage patients – Medicare Advantage plans are required to cover the same benefits as those covered by the MAC in that jurisdiction. For example, if a MAC in a jurisdiction has favorable coverage for the Argus II, then typically Medicare Advantage plans in that MAC jurisdiction offer the same coverage for the Argus II. Individual hospitals and ASCs may negotiate contracts specific to that individual facility, which may include additional separate payment for the Argus II implant system. In addition, procedural payment is variable and can be based on a percentage of billed charges, payment groupings or other individually negotiated payment methodologies. Medicare Advantage plans also allow providers to confirm coverage and payment for the Argus II procedure in advance of implantation. Over the last several years a large majority of all Medicare Advantage pre-authorization requests for Argus II procedures were granted.


● | Commercial insurer patients – Commercial insurance plans make coverage and payment rate decisions independent of Medicare, and contracts are individually negotiated with facility and physician providers.

 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, 38 individuals in the US and Canada were implanted with the Argus II technology. Of these patients, 34 were in the US primarily covered by Medicare FFS or Medicare Advantage plans and the remainder had private commercial, Veteran’s Administration or other insurance plan coverage. Four patients in Canada were covered by regional public reimbursement or private funding.
 
Second Sight employs dedicated employees and consultants with insurance reimbursement expertise engaged to expand and enhance coverage decisions. Currently, eight of 12 Medicare jurisdictions provide coverage of the Argus II in 31 states, two territories and the District of Columbia when medically necessary, including:
 
 
● | CGS (J15 -- Ohio and Kentucky),
--+--------------------------------


● | Palmetto GBA (JM -- Virginia, (excluding Part B for Arlington and Fairfax counties), West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina),

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Novitas (JL -- Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are actively engaged with the remaining four Medicare jurisdictions covered by two contractors and are committed to supporting their requests for additional information and clinical evidence. We expect that additional positive coverage decisions will be issued over time but cannot predict timing or ultimate success with each MAC. 
 
Within Europe, we have obtained reimbursement approval or funding in Germany and one region of Italy.
 
In France, we were selected to receive the first “Forfait Innovation” (Innovation Bundle) from the Ministry of Health, which is a special funding program for breakthrough procedures to be introduced into clinical practice. As part of this program, we conducted a post-market study in France which enrolled a total of 18 subjects who were followed for two years.  The French program also funded implantation of 18 additional subjects who were not part of the post-market study. We submitted the final clinical report of the Forfait Innovation study late last year and the outcomes of the study are still under review by the French National Health Authority (HAS). Subject to a successful and positive completion of HAS’ review of the outcomes of French study, our aim is for Argus II therapy to be covered and funded through the standard payment system in France. However, we can provide no assurance that the French government will make a positive decision to continue to fund the Argus II in future. 
 
In December 2016, NHS England announced it would cover 10 Argus implantations as part of a CtE program. The CtE program is especially designed for treatments that show significant promise for the future, while new clinical and patient experience data are collected within a formal evaluation program. This program is similar to the Forfait Innovation program in France. We are actively and closely working with NHS England to finalize the final details of the program that is expected to be kicked off within next few months.  
 
To date, our marketing activities have focused on raising awareness of the Argus II System with potential patients, implanting physicians, and referring physicians. Our marketing activities include exhibiting, sponsoring symposia, and securing podium presence at professional and trade shows, securing journalist coverage in popular and trade media, attending patient meetings focused on educating patients about existing and future treatments, and sponsoring information sessions for the Argus II System. In the United States advertisements are placed in geographic areas where we have Centers of Excellence committed to Argus II.
 
Leverage proven Argus technology to restore some vision with cortical stimulation to a broader market of blind individuals
 
We are in the process of developing a visual cortical prosthesis for a significantly larger market to include profoundly blind individuals, other than those who are blind due to currently treatable diseases or due to direct brain damage of the visual cortex. We refer to this product as Orion. We estimate that there are approximately 5.8 million people worldwide who are legally blind due to causes other than currently treatable conditions (including RP) or AMD. If approved for marketing, the FDA and other regulatory agencies will determine which of these patients are eligible for Orion.
 
Orion is designed to bypass the eye and optic nerve and directly stimulate the part of the brain responsible for vision. The system is based on technology that we utilize in our Argus II system, thereby reducing engineering investment costs and risks, and leveraging the reliability of the Argus II platform.
 
In November 2017, we received full FDA approval to begin the first human clinical feasibility study of the Orion visual prosthesis system. During 2018, we implanted and activated the first five subjects in the study, four subjects at UCLA and one subject at Baylor. To date, clinical results have been positive.  In addition, during the second quarter of 2018, we submitted and received approval from the FDA to enroll a sixth subject. We implanted the sixth subject at Baylor in January 2019. We anticipate enrolling additional feasibility subjects in 2019 while simultaneously negotiating the clinical and regulatory pathway to commercialization with the FDA as part of the Breakthrough Devices Program. 
 

Our Competition 
 
The US life sciences industry is highly competitive. The treatment of blindness is a significant clinically unmet need and others continue to make progress. There are several approaches to treating blindness including:
10

 
● | Retinal Prostheses (including the Argus II): aimed at giving more visual ability to a blind patient via implanting a device in the eye to stimulate remaining retina cells. Electrical neurostimulation technology has seen growing use in recent years for numerous applications– such as chronic pain, Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, epilepsy, and others. 
● | Visual Cortical Prosthesis (Orion) – We are developing a visual cortical prosthesis and, to our knowledge, the only company pursuing the development of such technology as a potential therapeutic modality. As we continue to demonstrate the potential benefits and safety profile of Orion, we may face competition from other entities seeking to develop a visual cortical prosthesis. While we are currently precluded by the exclusion criteria in our early feasibility study from testing Orion in any indication where a current therapeutic option exists, such as with RP using Argus, we or others may ultimately seek to demonstrate the potential benefits and safety profile of a visual cortical prosthesis for RP.


● | Transplants: transplanting retinal tissue to stimulate remaining retina cells.

11

 
● | Stem Cells: generally involves implanting immature retinal support cells aimed at slowing retinal degeneration. A single patient in London, England with wet AMD was reportedly implanted in 2015 with an embryonic stem cell line in a study sponsored by Pfizer. This study has been suspended. Patients with dry AMD are also being recruited in Los Angeles for a similar study. No data is yet available as to safety or efficacy of these implantations. A patient in Japan with AMD was implanted with induced pluripotent stem (ips) cells. These are mature cells reprogramed to be stem cells.


● | Genetics and Gene Therapy: involves identifying a specific gene that is causing retinal problems (there are over 120 for retinitis pigmentosa alone) resulting in visual impairments and blindness and inserting healthy genes into an individual’s cells using a virus to treat the diseases. A company completed a phase 3 study in 21 patients with a median age of 11 for a gene that affects a very small percentage of retinitis pigmentosa patients, RPE65. That company applied for and received FDA approval in 2018. We believe that there is virtually no overlap with our current market since our patients generally are older (Argus II is indicated for an age minimum of 25 in the US). The other company also injects better sighted patients since its treatment is aimed at improving residual vision. In contrast, Argus II seeks to create artificial vision where vision is completely lost. Pricing for these injections is reported to be approximately $850,000 for both eyes.
● | Optogenetics Therapy: aimed at slowing down, reversing, and/or eliminating the process by which photoreceptors in the eye are compromised. This therapy also requires infecting the patient’s cells with a virus. However, instead of fixing a gene defect, this approach would cause cells within the eye to become light sensitive. Animal work has shown that these cells are not sensitive enough to respond to ambient light, so this approach currently also requires a light amplifier outside the body to increase light delivered to the retina. The regulatory body in the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, has recently cleared optogenetic clinical trials to begin. 


● | Nutritional Therapy: involves diets or supplements that are thought to prevent or slow the progress of vision loss.


● | Implantable Telescope: VisionCare, Ophthalmic Technologies, Inc. offers an FDA approved implantable miniature telescope for AMD, a magnifying device that is implanted in the eye. The VisionCare telescope is approved for use in patients with severe to profound vision impairment (best corrected visual acuity of 20/160 to 20/800) due to dry AMD.


● | Wicab’s The BrainPort® V100 includes a video camera mounted on a pair of sunglasses, a hand-held controller, and tongue array. The tongue array contains 400 electrodes and is connected to the glasses via a flexible cable. White pixels from the camera are felt on the tongue as strong stimulation, black pixels as no stimulation, and gray levels as medium levels of stimulation. This device is indicated for the profoundly blind. 


● | There are currently no known treatments for AMD after the disease has caused severe to profound vision loss nor are there any established treatments that delay or reverse the progression of Dry AMD other than supplements.


● | Therapies exist for Wet AMD that delay the progression of visual impairment or slightly improve the vision, rather than completely curing or reversing its course. These therapies are approved in many regions throughout the world, including the US and EU.

 
Commercial efforts to develop retinal implants by others include:
 
 
● | Retina Implant AG: A privately held German company that is developing the Alpha IMS/Alpha AMS, a wireless sub-retinal implant. Although this company obtained a CE Mark in 2013 and was expected to begin commercialization during 2015 in the EU, to our knowledge this product is still not generally available to commercial patients. Retina Implant has also announced plans for a FDA trial in the US but has not announced any U.S. implants in this trial.

● | Pixium Vision S.A.: A publicly held French company that is developing the PRIMA (sub-retinal implant) for Dry-AMD patients. In 2017, Pixium announced approval for two feasibility studies of PRIMA in Dry-AMD patients. One study reportedly is in Paris with five sugjects, and a second study is planned in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with five subjects. To date Pixium has announced the successful implantation and activation of devices in Paris, but to our knowledge no performance data has yet been reported. 


● | NanoRetina Inc., a company based in Israel, and several other early stage companies are reported to have developed intellectual property or technology that may improve retinal prostheses in the future, but to our knowledge none of these efforts has resulted in a completed system that has been tested clinically in patients.


● | Academic entities are also working on vision restoring implants. These include Bionic Vision Australia (an early prototype device has been developed and to our knowledge implanted in three human subjects), Boston Retinal Implant project (preclinical phase), Monash Vision Group (preclinical phase), and the Illinois Institute of Technology (preclinical phase). Of these projects, we believe most have not yet demonstrated a working implant, only one has reportedly begun long-term clinical work in humans, and to our knowledge none has received FDA approval to begin clinical trials in the US.

 
To our knowledge, no other retinal prosthesis has been successful in long-term human trials, with the Argus II System currently the sole implant generally available to commercial patients for treating RP in the US, Canada, EU, and elsewhere. We anticipate that our competitors are unlikely to obtain significant commercial traction in EU until they have developed in depth clinical data showing the reliability and functionality of their products.
 
Warranty
 
We generally provide a standard limited warranty for the Argus II System covering replacement over the following periods after implant:
 
 
● | three years on implanted epiretinal prosthesis, 
● | two years on external components other than batteries and chargers, and
● | three months on batteries and chargers. 

 
Based on our experience to date, the Argus II System has proven to be a reliable device generally performing as intended. We have accrued warranty expense of $1.6 million as of December 31, 2018, which is based upon our historical experience rate.
 
Our Manufacturing and Quality Assurance 
 
We have a single manufacturing facility, located at our principal office in Los Angeles, California. The manufacturing areas at this location are housed in a single building, and include approximately 10,000 square feet of controlled environment rooms (CERs) suitable for implant manufacturing. We currently utilize less than half of this space for Argus II implant production. At the same site we maintain spaces for assembling the external (non-implantable) components of our system and for the labeling, receiving and shipping, and stockroom functions. Finished goods are held at this location and at our contracted logistics partner in Europe.
 
We rely on many suppliers to provide materials and services necessary to produce and test our products. Many of these materials or services are currently provided by sole source suppliers. In a number of instances we maintain sole source suppliers because our current purchasing volumes do not warrant developing more than one supplier. We expect to secure additional providers as our production volumes increase. If we experience a loss of a sole supplier before confirming an alternative, we risk possible disruptions in our operations. We attempt to mitigate the sole source risk by, among other things, increasing parts inventory as a partial hedge against interruptions in parts supply and by actively seeking to develop alternative suppler sources before experiencing any such disruptions.

Our manufacturing department currently employs 28 persons and the quality assurance department has an additional nine members. We operate a day shift and smaller swing shift, and at this staffing level we can manufacture approximately 10 devices per month. We believe that the space available at the current facility when fully utilized and operating at two full shifts will prove sufficient to build and assemble a combined total of approximately 100 Argus II or Orion devices per month.
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 123 employees, including approximately 49 in operations; 27 in selling, marketing and distribution; 31 in clinical, regulatory and research and development; and 16 in administration. Of these persons, we employed 108 in the United States and 15 in Europe. We believe that the continued success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and we are committed to developing our people and providing them with opportunities to contribute to our growth and success. None of these employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good to excellent.
Properties 
 
Our principal office and facilities are located at 12744 San Fernando Road, Suite 400, Sylmar, California 91342, and consists of approximately 45,351 rentable square feet at a current base rent of about $36,600 per month. Our lease expires in February 2022 and grants us an option to extend the lease term for an additional 60 months. We believe that the terms of this lease are at least as favorable as those that may have been obtained from a non-affiliated third party. We believe that these premises are adequate for our foreseeable needs. 
 
Our European office is located on the Innovation Park at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Rue Jean-Daniel Colladon, CH 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland. These premises consist of 180 square meters at a base rent of about 8,200 CHF per month, or currently about $8,161 per month based upon current exchange rates. As part of our restructuring and staffing reductions we have renegotiated this lease to 94 square meters at a base rent of 3,147 CHF or about $3,131 starting on January 1, 2019 based upon current exchange rates.
 
Legal Proceedings 
 
We are not a party to any pending legal proceedings other than those involving Pixium Vision described in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Other Legal Matters.”
