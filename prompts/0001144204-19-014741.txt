Overview 
  General.   BayCom is a bank holding company headquartered in Walnut Creek, California. BayCom’s wholly owned banking subsidiary, United Business Bank, provides a broad range of financial services to businesses and business owners as well as individuals through its network of 22 full service branches and one loan production office located in California, with a majority of our branches located in the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Washington and Central New Mexico. The Company’s business activities generally are limited to passive investment activities and oversight of its investment in the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this report, including consolidated financial statements and related data, relate primarily to the Bank. 
 Our principal objective is to continue to increase shareholder value and generate consistent earnings growth by expanding our commercial banking franchise through both strategic acquisitions and organic growth. We believe our strategy of selectively acquiring and integrating community banks has provided us with economies of scale and improved our overall franchise efficiency. We expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and believe our targeted market areas present us with many and varied acquisition opportunities. We are also focused on continuing to grow organically and believe the markets in which we operate currently provide meaningful opportunities to expand our commercial client base and increase our current market share. We believe our geographic footprint, which includes the San Francisco Bay area and the metropolitan markets of Los Angeles and Seattle and other community markets including Albuquerque, New Mexico, provides us with access to low cost, stable core deposits in community markets that we can use to fund commercial loan growth. We strive to provide an enhanced banking experience for our clients by providing them with a comprehensive suite of sophisticated banking products and services tailored to meet their needs, while delivering the high-quality, relationship-based client service of a community bank. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had, on a consolidated basis, total assets of $1.5 billion, total deposits of $1.3 billion, total loans, including loans held for sale, of $971.0 million (net of allowances) and total shareholders’ equity of $200.8 million. 
  Our History and Growth.   In January 2017, the Company became the holding company for the Bank. The Bank commenced banking operations as Bay Commercial Bank in July 2004 and changed the name to United Business Bank in April 2017, following our acquisition of United Business Bank, FSB in April 2017. 
 The Bank was founded in March 2004 as California state chartered commercial bank, by a group of Walnut Creek business and community leaders, including George Guarini, who serves as our Chief Executive Officer. The severe economic recession beginning in 2008 and the ongoing consolidation in the banking industry created an opportunity for our management team and board to build an attractive commercial banking franchise and create long-term value for our shareholders by employing an acquisition strategy that focuses on opportunities that grow our product portfolio and expand the business geographically. 
 Since 2010, we have implemented our vision of becoming a strategic consolidator of community banks and a destination for seasoned bankers and business persons who share our entrepreneurial spirit. While not without risk, we believe there are certain advantages resulting from mergers and acquisitions. These advantages include, among others, the diversification of our loan portfolio with seasoned loans, the expansion of our market areas and an effective method to augment our growth and risk management infrastructure through the retention of local lending personnel and credit administration personnel to manage the client relationships of the banks being acquired.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 We believe we have a successful track record of selectively acquiring, integrating and consolidating community banks. Since 2010, we have completed a series of six acquisitions with aggregate total assets of approximately $1.1 billion and total deposits of approximately $904.1 million. We have sought to integrate the banks we acquire into our existing operational platform and enhance shareholder value through the creation of efficiencies within the combined operations. 
 In April 2017, we completed our largest acquisition to date when we acquired First ULB Corp (“FULB”), the bank holding company for United Business Bank, FSB, headquartered in Oakland, California. This acquisition increased our deposits by approximately $428.0 million, consisting primarily of lower cost stable core deposits from a strong network of relationships with labor unions. At the time of acquisition, United Business Bank, FSB had total assets of approximately $473.1 million, which significantly increased our total asset size and provided us with nine full-service banking offices in Long Beach, Oakland, Sacramento, San Francisco, San Jose and Glendale, California; and Seattle, Washington and Albuquerque, New Mexico. This acquisition significantly increased our total asset size, expanded our geographic footprint and added low cost, stable deposits associated with a strong network of relationship with labor unions. 
 In November 2017, we acquired Plaza Bank, with one branch located in Seattle, Washington. At the time of the acquisition, Plaza Bank had total assets of approximately $75.8 million and deposits of $54.2 million. 
 In November 2018, we acquired Bethlehem Financial Corporation (“BFC”), the bank holding company for MyBank, headquartered in Belin, New Mexico, and paid a total of $23.5 million in cash for all of the outstanding equity securities of BFC. MyBank operated through five branches serving Central New Mexico. At the time of acquisition, MyBank had approximately $157.8 million in total assets and $135.5 million in deposits. 
  Our Initial Public Offering.   We completed the underwritten initial public offering (“IPO”) of our common stock on May 8, 2018, where we sold an aggregate of 3,278,900 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $22.00 per share. Our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on May 4, 2018 under the ticker symbol “BCML.” 
  Recent Developments.   On December 7, 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Uniti Financial Corporation (“Uniti”), the holding company for Uniti Bank. Pursuant to the merger agreement Uniti will merge with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation in the merger. Immediately after the merger, Uniti Bank, a California state-chartered bank and wholly owned subsidiary, will merge with and into the Bank, with the Bank as the surviving bank. The transaction was unanimously approved and adopted by the Board of Directors of each company and is expected to be completed in the second calendar quarter of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions and approval of Uniti’s shareholders. 
 Under the terms of the merger agreement, holders of Uniti common stock will receive (i) $2.30 in cash and (ii) 0.07234 shares of Company common stock for each share of Uniti common stock. The aggregate transaction consideration is valued at approximately $63.9 million in aggregate based on the closing price of our common stock of $23.39 on December 7, 2018. The total value of the transaction consideration will fluctuate until closing based on the value of the Company’s stock price. Upon consummation of the transaction, the shareholders of Uniti will own approximately 9.3% of the Company. At December 31, 2018, Uniti had approximately $345.8 million in total assets, $267.4 million in total loans, $295.9 million in total deposits and $47.7 million in stockholders’ equity. 
 Our Markets 
 We target our services to small and medium-sized businesses, professional firms, real estate professionals, nonprofit businesses, labor unions and related nonprofit entities and businesses and individual consumers within California, Seattle, Washington and Central New Mexico. We generally lend in markets where we have a physical presence through our branch offices. We operate primarily in the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, California Metropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”) with additional operations in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, California MSA, with Northern California responsible for 66.5% and Southern California responsible for 11.3% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 A majority of our branches are located in the San Francisco Bay Area which includes the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma, California. The greater San Francisco Bay Area contains two significant MSAs — the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward MSA and the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara MSA. With a population of approximately 4.7 million, the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward MSA represents the second most populous area in California and the twelfth largest in the United States. In addition to its current size, the market also demonstrates key characteristics we believe provide the opportunity for additional growth, including projected population growth of 5.9% through 2022 versus the national average of 3.7%, a median household income of $88,685 versus a national average of $57,462, and the third highest population density in the nation. The San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara MSA also demonstrates key characteristics that provide us growth opportunities, including a population of approximately 2.0 million, projected population growth of 6.0% through 2022, and a median household income of $101,689. 
 We operate two branch offices and one loan production office in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim California MSA. The greater Los Angeles area is one of the most significant business markets in the world and with an estimated gross domestic product of approximately $1 trillion, it would rank as the 16th largest economy in the world. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim California MSA maintains a population of approximately 13.5 million, the most populous area in California and the second largest in the United States. We believe the market’s projected population growth of 4.2% through 2022, its median household income of $64,343, large concentration of small and medium-sized businesses, and its highest population density in the nation position the area as an attractive market in which to expand operations. 
 We serve the Sacramento-Roseville-Arden-Arcade MSA through one branch office. With a population of approximately 2.3 million, the Sacramento-Roseville-Arden-Arcade MSA includes the city of Sacramento, the state capital of California. The population is projected to grow 5.1% through 2022 and the median household income is approximately $63,727. State and local government make up the largest employers, while transportation, health services, technology, agriculture and mining are important industries for the region. 
 We serve the Stockton-Lodi MSA in Central California though two branch offices. The market area has a population of approximately 740,596, which is projected to grow 5.4% through 2022, and a median household income of approximately $56,705. The area has a diverse industry mix, including agriculture, e-fulfillment centers, advanced manufacturing, data centers/call centers, and service industries. 
 We serve the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue MSA, which includes King County (which includes the city of Seattle), through two branch offices. King County has the largest population of any county in the state of Washington, covers approximately 2,100 square miles, and is located on Puget Sound. It had approximately 2.2 million residents, which is projected to grow 7.5% through 2022, and a median household income of approximately $81,089. King County has a diversified economic base with many employers from various industries including shipping and transportation (Port of Seattle, Paccar, Inc. and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.), retail (Amazon.com, Inc., Starbucks Corp. and Nordstrom, Inc.) aerospace (the Boeing Company) and computer technology (Microsoft Corp.) and biotech industries. 
 We serve the Albuquerque MSA, in Central New Mexico the most populous city in the state of New Mexico through six branch offices we recently acquired from FULB and BFC. The Albuquerque MSA has a population of approximately 911,171, ranking it as the 60th MSA in the country. The Albuquerque MSA population is projected to grow approximately 1.7% through 2022, and its median household income is approximately $50,192. Top industries in Albuquerque include aerospace and defense (Honeywell), energy technology including solar energy (SCHOTT Solar), and semiconductor and computer chip manufacturing (Intel Corp). In addition, the MyBank acquisition provided five branch offices in the Central New Mexico area. 
 Lending 
 We provide a comprehensive suite of financial solutions that competes with large, national competitors, but with the personalized attention and nimbleness of a relationship-focused community bank. We provide our commercial clients with a diverse array of cash management services.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 A general description of the range of commercial banking products and other services we offer follows. 
  Lending Activities.   We offer a full range of lending products, including commercial and multi-family real estate loans (including owner-occupied and investor real estate loans), commercial and industrial loans (including equipment loans and working capital lines of credit), U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans, construction and land loans, agriculture-related loans and consumer loans. Our preference is for owner-occupied real estate and commercial and industrial loans. We also offer consumer loans predominantly as an accommodation to our commercial clients, which include installment loans, unsecured and secured personal lines of credit, and overdraft protection. Lending activities originate from the relationships and efforts of our bankers. We are a preferred lender under the SBA loan program. 
 We may periodically purchase whole loans and loan participation interests or participate in syndicates originating new loans, including shared national credits, primarily during periods of reduced loan demand in our primary market areas and at times to support our Community Reinvestment Act lending activities. Any such purchases or loan participations are made generally consistent with our underwriting standards; however, the loans may be located outside of our normal lending areas. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we purchased $15.0 million and $5.8 million, respectively, of loans and loan participation interests, principally commercial and industrial and multi-family real estate loans. 
 We are a business-focused community bank, serving small and medium-sized businesses, trade unions and their related businesses, entrepreneurs and professionals located in our markets. We do not target any specific industries or business segments, rather we look to the quality of the client relationship. We attempt to differentiate ourselves by having an attentive and focused approach to our clients and utilizing, to the fullest extent possible, the flexibility that results from being an independently owned and operated bank. We focus on establishing and building strong financial relationships with our clients, using a trusted advisor and relationship approach. We emphasize personalized “relationship banking,” where the relationship is predicated on ongoing client contact, client access to decision makers, and our understanding of the clients’ business, market and competition which allows us to better meet the needs of our clients. 
 At December 31, 2018, we had net loans, excluding loans held for sale, of $970.2 million, representing 65.6% of our total assets. For additional information concerning our loan portfolio, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2018 and 2017 — Loans”, contained in this report. 
  Concentrations of Credit Risk.   Most of our lending is conducted with businesses and individuals in the San Francisco Bay Area. Our loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial real estate loans, including multi-family and construction loans, which totaled $749.3 million and constituted 76.8% of total loans as of December 31, 2018. Commercial and industrial loans totaled $121.9 million and constituted 12.5% of total loans as of December 31, 2018. Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by first liens on real property. The commercial and industrial loans are typically secured by general business assets, accounts receivable inventory and/or the corporate guaranty of the borrower and personal guaranty of its principals. The geographic concentration of our loans subjects our business to the general economic conditions within California, Washington and New Mexico. The risks created by such concentrations have been considered by management in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018. 
 Comprehensive risk management practices and appropriate capital levels are essential elements of a sound commercial real estate lending program. A concentration in commercial real estate adds a dimension of risk that compounds the risk inherent in individual loans. Interagency bank guidance on commercial real estate concentrations describe sound risk management practices which include board and management oversight, portfolio management, management information systems, market analysis, portfolio stress testing and sensitivity analysis, credit underwriting standards and credit risk review functions. Management believes it has implemented these practices in order to monitor the commercial real estate concentrations in our loan portfolio. 
  Large Credit Relationships.   As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate amount of loans to our 10 and 25 largest borrowers (including related entities) amounted to approximately $151.3 million, or 14.1% of total loans, and $178.5 million, or 18.3% of total loans, respectively. The table below shows our five largest

  Loan Underwriting and Approval.   Historically, we believe we have made sound, high quality loans, while recognizing that lending money involves a degree of business risk. Our current loan origination activities are governed by established policies and procedures intended to mitigate the risks inherent to the types of collateral and borrowers financed by us. These policies provide a general framework for our loan origination, monitoring and funding activities, while recognizing that not all risks can be anticipated. Our Board of Directors delegates loan approval authority up to board-approved limits to our Director Loan Committee, which is comprised of members of our Board of Directors. Any loans in excess of that limit require approval of the entire Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors also delegates limited individual lending authority up to $2.0 million to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Credit Officer, and the Director of Labor Service Division, and up to $500,000 to our Chief Credit Administrator, and, on a further limited basis, to selected credit relationship managers and lending officers in each of our target markets up to $50,000. When the total relationship exceeds an individual’s loan authority, a higher authority is required. The objective of our approval process is to provide a disciplined, collaborative approach to larger credits while maintaining responsiveness to client needs. 
 Loan decisions are documented as to the borrower’s business, purpose of the loan, evaluation of repayment source and the associated risks, evaluation of collateral, covenants and monitoring requirements, and the risk rating rationale. Our strategy for approving or disapproving loans is to follow our loan policies and underwriting practices, on a consistent basis, which include: 
 •

 maintaining close relationships among our clients and their designated bankers, to ensure ongoing credit monitoring and loan servicing; 
 ​
 •

 granting credit on a sound basis, with full knowledge of the purpose and source of repayment for such credit; 
 ​
 •

 ensuring that primary and secondary sources of repayment are adequate in relation to the amount of the loan; 
 ​
 •

 developing and maintaining targeted levels of diversification for our loan portfolio as a whole and for loans within each category; and 
 ​
 •

 ensuring that each loan is properly documented and that any insurance coverage requirements are satisfied. 
 ​
 Managing credit risk is an enterprise-wide process. The principal economic risk associated with each category of loans that we make is the creditworthiness of the borrower and the value of the underlying collateral, if any. Borrower creditworthiness is affected by general economic conditions and the strength of the relevant business market segment. We assess the lending risks, economic conditions and other relevant

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 factors related to the quality of our loan portfolio in order to identify possible credit quality risks. Our strategy for credit risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all credit exposures. Our processes emphasize early-stage review of loans, regular credit evaluations and management reviews of loans, which supplement the ongoing and proactive credit monitoring and loan servicing provided by our bankers. Our Chief Credit Officer provides Company-wide credit oversight and periodically reviews all credit risk portfolios to ensure that the risk identification processes are functioning properly and that our credit standards are followed. In addition, a third-party loan review is performed to assist in the identification of problem assets and to confirm our internal risk rating of loans. These credit review consultants review a sample of loans periodically and report the results of their findings to the Audit Committee of the Bank’s Board of Directors. Results of loan reviews by consultants as well as examination of the loan portfolio by state and federal regulators are also considered by management and the board in determining the level of the allowance for loan losses. We attempt to identify potential problem loans early in an effort to seek aggressive resolution of these situations before the loans become a loss, record any necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain adequate allowance levels for probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. 
 Our loan policies generally include other underwriting guidelines for loans collateralized by real estate. These underwriting standards are designed to determine the maximum loan amount that a borrower has the capacity to repay based upon the type of collateral securing the loan and the borrower’s income. Such loan policies include maximum amortization schedules loan to value and other loan terms for each category of loans collateralized by liens on real estate. 
 In addition, our loan policies provide the following: 
 •

 guidelines for personal guarantees 
 ​
 •

 an environmental review 
 ​
 •

 loans to employees, executive officers and directors 
 ​
 •

 problem loan identification 
 ​
 •

 maintenance of an adequate allowance for loan losses 
 ​
 •

 other matters relating to lending practices 
 ​
 General economic factors affecting a borrower’s ability to repay include interest, inflation and unemployment rates, as well as other factors affecting a borrower’s clients, suppliers and employees. The well-established financial institutions in our primary markets make proportionately more loans to medium-to-large-sized businesses than we originate. Many of our commercial loans are, or will likely be, made to small-to-medium-sized businesses that may be less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers. 
  Lending Limits.   Our lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by federal and state law. In general, we are subject to a legal lending limit on loans to a single borrower based on the Bank’s capital level. The dollar amounts of our lending limit increases or decreases as the Bank’s capital increases or decreases. We are able to sell participations in its larger loans to other financial institutions, which allows us to manage the risk involved in these loans and to meet the lending needs of its clients requiring extensions of credit in excess of these limits. 
 Legal lending limits are calculated in conformance with California law, which prohibits a bank from lending to any one individual or entity or its related interests on an unsecured basis any amount that exceeds 15 percent of the sum of such bank’s shareholders’ equity plus the allowance for loan losses, capital notes and any debentures, plus an additional 10 percent for loans on a secured basis. At December 31, 2018, our authorized legal lending limit for loans to one borrower was $22.9 million for unsecured loans and $38.1 million for specific secured loans. Currently, we maintain an in-house limit of $8.7 million for unsecured loans and $14.5 million for secured loans. At December 31, 2018, there were no loans to one individual or entity or related interests that exceeded these internal limits. We have strict policies and procedures in place for the establishment of limits with respect to specific products and businesses, and evaluating exceptions to the internal limits for individual relationships.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Our loan policies provide general guidelines for loan-to-value ratios that restrict the size of loans to a maximum percentage of the value of the collateral securing the loans, which varies by the type of collateral. Our internal loan-to-value limitations follow limits established by applicable law. Exceptions to our policies are allowed only with the prior approval of the Board of Directors and if the borrower exhibits financial strength or sufficient, measurable compensating factors exist after consideration of the loan-to-value ratio, borrower’s financial condition, net worth, credit history, earnings capacity, installment obligations, and current payment history. 
  Loan Types.   We provide a variety of loans to meet our clients’ needs. The real estate portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of the following: mortgage loans secured typically by commercial and multi-family properties; mortgages and revolving lines of credit secured by equity in residential properties; and construction and land loans. At December 31, 2018, we held $852.0 million in loans secured by real estate, representing 87.3% of total loans receivable, and had undisbursed construction and land commitments of $17.5 million. The types of our loans are described below: 
  Commercial Real Estate Loans.   Our commercial real estate loans include loans secured by office buildings, retail facilities, hotels, gas stations, convalescent facilities, industrial use buildings, restaurants and multi-family properties. At December 31, 2018, our commercial real estate loan portfolio totaled $702.0 million, or 71.9% of our total loan portfolio (excluding loans held for sale). 
 Our commercial real estate loans may be owner occupied or non-owner occupied. As of December 31, 2018, our commercial real estate loans, excluding loans secured by multi-family properties, consisted of $272.7 million of owner occupied commercial real estate loans, or 27.9% of the total loan portfolio, and $312.1 million of non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, or 32.0% of the total loan portfolio. 
 Commercial real estate secured loans generally carry higher interest rates and have shorter terms than one-to-four family residential real estate loans. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of the loan is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans, to cover operating expenses and debt service. We require our commercial real estate loans to be secured by a property with adequate margins and generally obtain a guarantee from responsible parties. Our commercial real estate loans generally are collateralized by first liens on real estate, have interest rates which may be fixed for three to five years, or adjust annually. Commercial real estate loan terms generally are limited to 15 years or less, although payments may be structured on a longer amortization basis up to 20 years with balloon payments or rate adjustments due at the end of three to seven years. We generally charge an origination fee for our services. 
 Payments on loans secured by such properties are often dependent on the successful operation (in the case of owner occupied real estate) or management (in the case of non-owner occupied real estate) of the properties. Accordingly, repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy, to a greater extent than other types of loans. Commercial real estate loans are underwritten primarily using a cash flow analysis and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. In underwriting commercial real estate loans, we seek to minimize risks in a variety of ways, including giving careful consideration to the property’s age, condition, operating history, future operating projections, current and projected market rental rates, vacancy rates, location and physical condition. The underwriting analysis also may include credit verification, reviews of appraisals, environmental hazards or reports, the borrower’s liquidity and leverage, management experience of the owners or principals, economic condition, industry trends and any guarantees, including SBA loan guarantees. At December 31, 2018, $48.1 million of our commercial real estate loans had SBA guarantees. We generally require personal guarantees from the principal owners of the property supported by a review by our management of the principal owners’ personal financial statements. We attempt to limit our risk by analyzing the borrowers’ cash flow and collateral value on an ongoing basis and by an annual review of rent rolls and financial statements. The loan-to-value ratio as established by an independent appraisal typically will not exceed 80% at loan origination and is lower in most cases. At December 31, 2018, the average loan size in our commercial real estate portfolio was approximately $973,000 with a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 57.2%. 
 Agriculture is a major industry in the Central Valley of California, one of our lending markets. We make agricultural real estate secured loans to borrowers with a strong capital base, sufficient management depth, proven ability to operate through agricultural cycles, reliable cash flows and adequate financial

 reporting. Generally, our agricultural real estate secured loans amortize over periods of 20 years or less and the typical loan-to-value ratio will not exceed 80% at loan origination, although actual loan-to-value ratios are typically lower. Payments on agricultural real estate secured loans depend, to a large degree, on the results of operations of the related farm entity. The repayment is also subject to other economic and weather conditions, as well as market prices for agricultural products, which can be highly volatile. Among the more common risks involved in agricultural lending, are weather conditions, disease, water availability and water distribution rights, which can be mitigated through multi-peril crop insurance. Commodity prices also present a risk, which may be managed by the use of set price contracts. As part of our underwriting, the borrower is required to obtain multi-peril crop insurance. Normally, in making agricultural real estate secured loans, our required beginning and projected operating margins provide for reasonable reserves to offset unexpected yield and price deficiencies. We also consider management succession, life insurance and business continuation plans when evaluating agricultural real estate secured loans. At December 31, 2018, our agricultural real estate secured loans, totaled $16.7 million, or 1.7% of our loan portfolio. 
 The following table presents a breakdown of our commercial real estate loan portfolio at the dates indicated:

 We currently target individual commercial real estate loans between $1.0 million and $5.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, the largest commercial real estate loan had a net outstanding balance of $13.0 million, and was secured by a first deed of trust on a retail strip center located in Sacramento, California. The largest commercial real estate loan secured by multifamily property as of December 31, 2018, was a 12-unit apartment complex with a net outstanding principal balance of $12.0 million, located in San Francisco, California. Both of these loans were performing according to their respective loan repayment terms as of December 31, 2018. 
  Construction and Land Loans.   We make loans to finance the construction of residential and non-residential properties. Construction loans include loans for owner occupied single-family homes and commercial projects (such as multi-family housing, industrial, office and retail centers). These loans generally are collateralized by first liens on real estate and typically have a term of less than one year, floating interest rates and commitment fees. Construction loans are typically made to builders/developers that have an established record of successful project completion and loan repayment. We conduct periodic inspections, either directly or through an agent, prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans, based on the percentage of completion. Underwriting guidelines for our construction loans are similar to those described above for our commercial real estate lending. Our construction loans have terms that typically range from six months to two years, depending on factors such as the type and size of the development and the financial strength of the borrower/guarantor. Construction loans are typically structured with an interest-only period during the construction phase. Construction loans are underwritten to either mature, or 

 10

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 transition to a traditional amortizing loan at the completion of the construction phase. The loan-to-value ratio on our construction loans, as established by independent appraisal, typically will not exceed 80% at loan origination, and is lower in most cases. At December 31, 2018, we had $47.3 million in construction and land loans outstanding, representing 4.8% of the total loan portfolio, with $17.5 million in undisbursed commitments. The average loan size in our construction loan portfolio was approximately $507,000 at December 31, 2018, with a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 50.7%. 
 On a more limited basis, we also make land loans to developers, builders and individuals, to finance the commercial development of improved lots or unimproved land. In making land loans, we follow underwriting policies and disbursement and monitoring procedures similar to those for construction loans. The initial term on land loans is typically one to three years with monthly interest-only payments. 
 Construction and land loans generally involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of a project under construction, and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion. Because of uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. As a result of these uncertainties, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds, with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, there is no assurance that we will be able to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project, and it may be necessary to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time subject to the regulatory limitations imposed by local, state or federal laws. Loans on land under development or held for future construction also pose additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral. 
  One-to-Four Family Residential Loans.   We do not originate owner-occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans. Our one-to-four family real estate loans were either acquired through our mergers with other financial institutions or by purchases of whole loan pools with servicing retained. Generally, these loans were originated to meet the requirements of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Federal Housing Administration, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and jumbo loans for sale in the secondary market to investors. Our one-to-four family loans do not allow for interest-only payments, nor negative amortization of principal, and carry allowable prepayment restrictions. At December 31, 2018, our one-to-four family loan portfolio, including home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $102.7 million or 10.5% of the total loan portfolio. 
 We do originate a limited amount of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit generally may have a loan-to-value of up 80% at the time origination when combined with the first mortgage. The majority of these loans are secured by a first or second mortgage on residential property. Home equity lines of credit allow for a 10 year draw period, with a 10 year repayment period, and the interest rate is generally tied to the prime rate as published by the Wall Street Journal and may include a margin. Home equity loans generally have ten year maturities based on a 30 year amortization. We retain a valid lien on the real estate, obtain a title insurance policy that insures that the property is free from encumbrances and require hazard insurance. At December 31, 2018, home equity loans and lines of credit totaled $15.1 million or 1.6% of the total loan portfolio, of which $2.6 million were secured by junior liens. Unfunded commitments on home equity lines of credit at December 31, 2018, totaled $8.6 million. 
  Commercial and Industrial Loans.   We make commercial and industrial loans, including commercial lines of credit, working capital loans, term loans, equipment financing, acquisition, expansion and development loans, SBA loans, letters of credit and other loan products, primarily in our target markets, which are underwritten on the basis of the borrower’s ability to service the debt from operating income. We take as collateral, a lien on general business assets, including, among other things, real estate, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, and generally obtain a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. Our operating lines of credit typically are limited to a percentage of the value of the assets securing the line. Lines of credit and term loans are typically reviewed annually. The terms of our commercial and industrial loans vary by purpose and by type of underlying collateral. We typically make equipment loans for a term 

 11

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 of five years or less at fixed or adjustable rates, with the loan fully amortized over the term. Loans to support working capital typically have terms not exceeding one year and are usually secured by accounts receivable, inventory and personal guarantees of the principals of the business. The interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk and loan amount and are further subject to competitive pressures, money market rates, the availability of funds and government regulations. For loans secured by accounts receivable and inventory, principal is typically repaid as the assets securing the loan are converted into cash (monitored on a monthly or more frequent basis as determined necessary in the underwriting process), and for loans secured with other types of collateral, principal is typically due at maturity. Terms greater than five years may be appropriate in some circumstances, based upon the useful life of the underlying asset being financed or if some form of credit enhancement, such as an SBA guarantee is obtained. These programs have a further benefit to us in terms of liquidity and potential fee income, since there is an active secondary market which will purchase the guaranteed portion of these loans at a premium. At December 31, 2018, we had commercial and industrial loans of $121.9 million or 12.5% of the total loan portfolio. 
 We also make agricultural operating loans, including loans to finance the purchase of machinery, equipment and breeding stock; seasonal crop operating loans used to fund the borrower’s crop production operating expenses; and livestock operating and revolving loans used to purchase livestock for resale and related livestock production expense. Agricultural operating loans are generally originated at an adjustable-or fixed-rate of interest and generally for a term of up to seven years. In the case of agricultural operating loans secured by breeding livestock and/or farm equipment, such loans are originated at fixed rates of interest for a term of up to five years. We typically originate agricultural operating loans on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s agricultural business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of agricultural operating loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment. A significant number of agricultural borrowers with these types of loans may qualify for relief under a chapter of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that is designed specifically for the reorganization of financial obligations of family farmers and which provides certain preferential procedures to agricultural borrowers compared to traditional bankruptcy proceedings pursuant to other chapters of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As of December 31, 2018, we had agricultural operating loans of $7.2 million or 0.7% of the total loan portfolio. 
 In general, commercial and industrial loans may involve increased credit risk; therefore, typically yield a higher return. The increased risk in commercial and industrial loans derives from the expectation that such loans generally are serviced principally from the operations of the business, and those operations may not be successful. Any interruption or discontinuance of operating cash flows from the business, which may be influenced by events not under the control of the borrower such as economic events and changes in governmental regulations, could materially affect the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. In addition, the collateral securing commercial and industrial loans generally includes moveable property such as equipment and inventory, which may decline in value more rapidly than we anticipate, exposing us to increased credit risk. As a result of these additional complexities, variables and risks, commercial and industrial loans require extensive underwriting and servicing. 
  Consumer Loans.   We generally make consumer loans as an accommodation to our clients on a case by case basis. These loans represent a small portion of our overall loan portfolio. However, these loans are important in terms of servicing our client’s needs. We make a variety of loans to individuals for personal and household purposes, including secured and unsecured term loans. Consumer loans are underwritten based on the individual borrower’s income, current debt level, past credit history and the value of any available collateral. The terms of consumer loans vary considerably based upon the loan type, nature of collateral and size of the loan. Consumer loans entail greater risk than do residential real estate loans because they may be unsecured or, if secured, the value of the collateral, such as an automobile or boat, may be more difficult to assess and more likely to decrease in value than real estate. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan balance. The remaining deficiency often will not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be 

 12

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans. As of December 31, 2018, consumer loans totaled approximately $1.8 million or 0.2% of the Company’s total loan portfolio.

 Sources of Funds 
  Deposits.   Our lending and investing activities are primarily funded by deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a wide range of interest rates and terms including demand, savings, money market and time deposits with the goal of attracting a wide variety of clients. We solicit these accounts from individuals, small to medium sized businesses, trade unions and their related businesses, associations, organizations and government authorities. Our transaction accounts and time certificates are tailored to the principal market area at rates competitive with those offered in the area. We employ client acquisition strategies to generate new account and deposit growth, such as client referral incentives, search engine optimization, targeted direct mail and email campaigns, in addition to conventional marketing initiatives and advertising. While we do not actively solicit wholesale deposits for funding purposes and do not partner with deposit brokers, we do participate in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) service via Promontory Interfinancial Network an as option for our clients to place funds. Our goal is to cross-sell our deposit products to our loan clients. 
 We also offer convenience-related services, including banking by appointment (before or after normal business hours on weekdays and on weekends), online banking services, access to a national automated teller machine network, extended drive-through hours, remote deposit capture, and courier service so that clients’ deposit and other banking needs may be served without the client having to make a trip to the branch. Our full suite of online banking solutions including access to account balances, online transfers, online bill payment and electronic delivery of client statements, mobile banking solutions for iPhone and Android phones, including remote check deposit with mobile bill pay. We offer debit cards with no ATM surcharges or foreign ATM fees for checking clients, plus night depository, direct deposit, cashier’s and travelers checks and letters of credit, as well as treasury management services, wire transfer services and automated clearing house (“ACH”) services. 
 We have implemented deposit gathering strategies and tactics which have enabled us to attract and retain deposits utilizing technology to deliver high quality commercial depository (treasury management) services (e.g. remote deposit capture lock box, electronic bill payments wire transfers, direct deposits and automatic transfers) in addition to the traditional generation of deposit relationships performed in conjunction with our lending activities. We offer a wide array of commercial treasury management services designed to be competitive with banks of all sizes. Treasury management services include balance reporting (including current day and previous day activity), transfers between accounts, wire transfer initiation, ACH origination and stop payments. Cash management deposit products consist of lockbox, remote deposit capture, positive pay, reverse positive pay, account reconciliation services, zero balance accounts and sweep accounts including loan sweep. 
 We provide an avenue for large depositors to maintain full insurance coverage by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) for all deposits up to $50.0 million. Under an agreement with Promontory International Financial Network, we participate in the CDARS and the Insured Cash Sweep (ICS) money market product. These are deposit-matching programs which distribute excess balances on deposit with us across other participating banks. In return, those participating financial institutions place their excess client deposits with us in a reciprocal amount. These products are designed to enhance our ability to attract and retain clients and increase deposits by providing additional FDIC insurance for large deposits. We also participate in the ICS One-Way Sell program, which allows us to buy cost effective wholesale funding on customizable terms. At December 31, 2018, we had $32.4 million in reciprocal CDARS and $117.6 million in one-way CDARS and ICS deposits. 
 Additionally, we offer escrow services on commercial transactions and facilitate tax-deferred commercial exchanges through the Bank’s division, BES. This affords us a low cost core deposit base. These 

 13

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 deposits fluctuate as the sellers of the real estate have up to nine months to invest in replacement real estate to defer the income tax on the property sold. Deposits related to BES totaled $25.2 million at December 31, 2018. 
 We also from time to time, bid for and accept deposits from public entities in our markets. 
 For additional information concerning our deposits, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2018 and 2017 — Deposits” contained in this report. 
  Borrowings.   Although deposits are our primary source of funds, we may from time to time utilize borrowings as a cost-effective source of funds when they can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, for additional capacity to fund loan demand, or to meet our asset/liability management goals. We are a member of and may obtain advances from the FHLB of San Francisco, which is part of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The eleven regional Federal Home Loan Banks provide a central credit facility for their member institutions. These advances are provided upon the security of certain mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. These advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate, range of maturities and call features. In addition to FHLB advances, we may also utilize Fed Funds purchased from correspondent banks as a source of short-term funding. At December 31, 2018, we had the ability to borrow up to $369.4 million from the FHLB and $55.0 million available under our Fed Funds lines, none of which was outstanding. 
 At December 31, 2018, we had $8.2 million aggregate principal (net of mark-to-market adjustments) of junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities by two statutory business trusts assumed in our acquisitions of BFC and FULB. 
 For additional information concerning our borrowings, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2018 and 2017 — Borrowings” contained in this report. 
 Investments 
 In addition to loans, we make other investments that conform to our investment policy as set by our Board of Directors. The primary objectives of our investment policy are to provide a source of liquidity, to provide an appropriate return on funds invested, to manage interest rate risk, to meet pledging requirements and to meet regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio totaled $99.8 million, with an average yield of 2.9% and an estimated duration of approximately 3.4 years. 
 We employ professional investment advisory firms to assist in the management of our investment portfolio to enhance our yield and facilitate use of modeling and administration. While our investments are made by our Chief Financial Officer, our Bank’s Board of Directors and Asset/Liability Management Committee remain responsible for the regular review of our investment activities, the review and approval of our investment policy and ensuring compliance with our investment policy. 
 Our investment policy outlines investment type limitations, security mix parameters, authorization guidelines and risk management guidelines. The policy authorizes us to invest in a variety of investment securities, subject to various limitations. Our current investment portfolio consists of obligations of the U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agencies or sponsored entities, including mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and municipal securities. 
 For additional information concerning our investments, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2018 and 2017 — Securities” contained in this report. 
 Supervision and Regulation 
 BayCom and United Business Bank are subject to significant regulation by federal and state laws and regulations, and the policies of applicable federal and state banking agencies. The following discussion of particular statutes and regulations affecting BayCom and United Business Bank is only a brief summary and does not purport to be complete. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations. No assurance can be given that such statutes or regulations will not change in the future.

 2018 Reforms 
 In May 2018 the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Economic Growth Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. 
 The Economic Growth Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for depository institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” of between 8 and 10 percent. Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds the “community bank leverage ratio” will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered to be “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules. 
 The Economic Growth Act also expands the category of holding companies that may rely on the “Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement” by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying holding company may have from $1.0 billion to $3.0 billion. A major effect of this change is to exclude such holding companies from the minimum capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the Economic Growth Act includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans. 
 It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the Economic Growth Act will ultimately be applied to us or what specific impact the Economic Growth Act and the yet to be written implementing rules and regulations will have. 
 United Business Bank 
  General.   As a state-chartered, federally insured commercial bank, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation and must comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, including prescribed minimum capital standards. As a California chartered bank, the Bank is subject to supervision, periodic examination, and regulation by the California Department of Business Oversight, Division of Financial Institutions (“DBO”) and by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve,”) as its primary federal regulator. The Bank’s relationship with depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by both federal and state law, especially in such matters as the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of mortgage and other loan documents. 
 Federal and state banking laws and regulations govern all areas of the operation of the Bank, including reserves, loans, investments, deposits, capital, issuance of securities, payment of dividends and establishment of branches. Bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks and bank holding companies if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice and in other circumstances. The Federal Reserve as the primary federal regulator of the Company and the Bank, and the DBO have the authority to impose penalties, initiate civil and administrative actions and take other steps intended to prevent banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices. 
 The laws and regulations affecting banks and bank holding companies changed significantly in connection with the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve. The CFPB assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. Any change in applicable laws, regulations, or regulatory policies may have a material effect on our business, operations, and prospects. We cannot predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that any fiscal or monetary policies or new federal or state legislation may have in the future.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
  State Regulation and Supervision.   As a California-chartered commercial bank with branches in the States of California, New Mexico and Washington, the Bank is subject not only to the applicable provisions of California law and regulations, but is also subject to applicable New Mexico and Washington law and regulations. These state laws and regulations govern the Bank’s ability to take deposits and pay interest thereon, make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate, make consumer loans, invest in securities, offer various banking services to its clients and establish branch offices. 
  Deposit Insurance.   The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposit accounts of the Bank up to $250,000 per separately insured depositor. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, FDIC-insured institutions. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC’s deposit insurance assessments be based on assets instead of deposits. The FDIC’s regulation specifies that the assessment base for a bank is equal to its total average consolidated assets less average tangible capital. During 2018 and currently, assessment rates range from 3 to 30 basis points for all institutions, subject to adjustments for unsecured debt issued by the institution, unsecured debt issued by other FDIC-insured institutions, and brokered deposits held by the institution. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC imposed a surcharge on institutions with assets of $10 billion or more commencing on July 1, 2016 and ending when the reserve ratio reaches 1.35%, which the FDIC has announced occurred on September 30, 2018. When the reserve ratio reaches 1.38%, smaller institutions will receive credits for the portions of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. Subject to certain limitations, the credits will apply to reduce regular assessments until exhausted. 
 Under the current rules, when the reserve ratio for the prior assessment period is equal to or greater than 2.0% and less than 2.5%, assessment rates will range from two basis points to 28 basis points, and when the reserve ratio for the prior assessment period is greater than 2.5%, assessment rates will range from one basis point to 25 basis points (in each case subject to adjustments as described above for current rates). No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its FDIC’s deposit insurance assessment. 
 The FDIC also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. 
 The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines, after a hearing, that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances which would result in termination of the deposit insurance of the Bank. 
  Standards for Safety and Soundness.   The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, and compensation, fees and benefits. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions. Each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution’s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities. The information security program must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of client information, protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any client, and ensure the proper disposal of client and consumer information. Each insured depository institution must also develop and implement a risk-based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to client information in client information systems. If the FDIC determines that an institution fails to meet any of these guidelines, it may require an institution to submit to the FDIC an acceptable plan to achieve compliance.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Capital Requirements.   Federally insured financial institutions, such as the Bank, are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital. As discussed above, the Economic Growth Act raised the maximum amount of consolidated assets a qualifying holding company may have to $3.0 billion under the Federal Reserve’s “Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement” pursuant to which the Company is generally not subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital regulations, which are generally the same as the capital regulations applicable to the Bank. The Federal Reserve made this change effective August 30, 2019. The Federal Reserve expects the holding company’s subsidiary banks to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations, discussed below. If the Company were subject to regulatory guidelines for bank holding companies with $3.0 billion or more in assets at December 31, 2018, the Company would have exceeded all regulatory requirements. 
 The capital regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve effective January 1, 2015 (with some changes transitioned into full effectiveness over several years) establish minimum required ratios for common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, Tier 1 capital, and total capital and the leverage ratio; risk-weightings of certain assets and other items for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, a required capital conservation buffer over the required capital ratios; and define what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements. These regulations implement the regulatory capital reforms required by the Dodd-Frank Act and the “Basel III” requirements. 
 Under the capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (1) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) of 4.0%. CET1 generally consists of common stock, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) unless an institution elects to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital, and certain minority interests (all of which are subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions). Tier 1 capital generally consists of CET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of other preferred stock and subordinated debt which meet certain conditions, plus an amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of assets. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. 
 There have been a number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital compared to the rules in effect prior to January 1, 2015, some of which are subject to transition periods. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital and eliminate or significantly reduce the use of hybrid capital instruments, especially trust preferred securities, as regulatory capital. Trust preferred securities issued by a company, with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion before May 19, 2010 and treated as regulatory capital are grandfathered, but any such securities issued later are not eligible as regulatory capital under the new regulations. If an institution grows above $15 billion as a result of an acquisition, the trust preferred securities are excluded from Tier 1 capital and instead included in Tier 2 capital. Mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are deducted from capital. In addition, Tier 1 capital includes AOCI, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities. However, because of our asset size, we were eligible to elect, and did elect, to permanently opt out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities in our capital calculations. 
 For purposes of determining risk-based capital, assets and certain off-balance sheet items are risk-weighted from 0% to 1,250%, depending on the risk characteristics of the asset or item. The current regulations changed certain risk-weightings compared to the earlier capital rules, including a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans, and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; and a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital. 
 In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1, leverage ratio and total capital ratios, the capital regulations require a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum risk-based capital levels in order to avoid limitations on

 paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses. The new capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets was required, which amount increased each year by 0.625% to an amount greater than 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 
 To be considered “well capitalized,” a bank holding company must have, on a consolidated basis, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and must not be subject to an individual order, directive or agreement under which the Federal Reserve requires it to maintain a specific capital level. To be considered “well capitalized,” a depository institution must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, a CET1 capital ratio of at least 6.5% and a leverage ratio of at least 5.0% and not be subject to an individualized order, directive or agreement under which its primary federal banking regulator requires it to maintain a specific capital level. 
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard for U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) that requires FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies (banking organizations) to recognize credit losses expected over the life of certain financial assets. CECL covers a broader range of assets than the current method of recognizing credit losses and generally results in earlier recognition of credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, a banking organization must record a one-time adjustment to its credit loss allowances as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of credit loss allowances under the current methodology and the amount required under CECL. For a banking organization, implementation of CECL is generally likely to reduce retained earnings, and to affect other items, in a manner that reduces its regulatory capital. 
 The federal banking regulators (Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC) have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital. 
  Prompt Corrective Action.   Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework for FDIC-insured institutions based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institution’s category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures. The well-capitalized category is described above. An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits generally. To be considered adequately capitalized, an institution must have the minimum capital ratios described above. Any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. 
 Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements, regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized. Failure by the Bank to comply with applicable capital requirements would, if not remedied, result in progressively more severe restrictions on its activities and lead to enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and, ultimately, the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator. Banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Additionally, approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements. 
 As of December 31, 2018, the Bank met the requirements to be “well capitalized” at the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement. For additional information, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Schedules” contained in this report. 
  Commercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations.   The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as 

 18

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank’s commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance directs the federal bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to commercial real estate concentration risk: 
 •

 Total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of the bank’s total regulatory capital; or 
 ​
 •

 Total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) represent 300% or more of the bank’s total regulatory capital or the outstanding balance of the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. 
 ​
 The guidance provides that the strength of an institution’s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank’s aggregate recorded loan balances for construction, land development and land loans were 19.7% of total regulatory capital. In addition, at December 31, 2018, the Bank’s commercial real estate loans as calculated in accordance with regulatory guidance were 315.1% of total regulatory capital. The Bank believes that the guidelines are applicable to it, as it has a relatively high concentration in commercial real estate loans. The Bank and its Board of Directors have discussed the guidelines and believe that the Bank’s underwriting policies, management information systems, independent credit administration process, and monitoring of real estate loan concentrations are sufficient to address the guidelines. 
  Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Financial Institutions.   California-chartered banks have powers generally comparable to those of national banks. Federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of FDIC insured, state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (1) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (2) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank’s total assets, (3) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or re-insures directors’, trustees’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage or bankers’ blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions, and (4) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met. 
  Environmental Issues Associated With Real Estate Lending.   The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present “owners and operators” of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress acted to protect secured creditors by providing that the term “owner and operator” excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this “secured creditor exemption” has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan. To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including the Bank, that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs, which costs often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property. 
  Federal Reserve System.   The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) of San Francisco. As a member of the FRB, the Bank is required to own stock in the FRB of San Francisco based on a specified ratio relative to our capital. FRB stock is carried at cost and may be sold back to the FRB at its par value. The FRB requires that all depository institutions maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or noninterest bearing deposits with the regional Federal Reserve Bank. Interest bearing checking accounts and other types of accounts that 

 19

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to Regulation D reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a bank. At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s deposits with the FRB and vault cash exceeded its reserve requirements. 
  Affiliate Transactions.   The Company and the Bank are separate and distinct legal entities. The Company is an affiliate of the Bank and any non-bank subsidiary of the Company is an affiliate of the Bank. Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in certain transactions with their affiliates. Transactions deemed to be a “covered transaction” under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act between a bank and an affiliate are limited to 10% of the bank’s capital and surplus and, with respect to all affiliates, to an aggregate of 20% of the bank’s capital and surplus. Further, covered transactions that are loans and extensions of credit generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. Federal law also requires that covered transactions and certain other transactions listed in Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act between a bank and its affiliates be on terms as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates. 
  Community Reinvestment Act.   The Bank is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”), which requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency to assess a bank’s performance under the CRA in meeting the credit needs of the community serviced by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency’s assessment of the bank’s record is made available to the public. Further, a bank’s CRA performance rating must be considered in connection with a bank’s application to, among other things, to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, relocate an existing office or merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution. The Bank received a “satisfactory” rating during its most recently completed CRA examination. 
  Dividends.   Dividends from the Bank constitute the major source of funds available for dividends which may be paid to the Company’s shareholders. The amount of dividends payable by the Bank to the Company depend upon the Bank’s earnings and capital position, and is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies, including the capital conservation buffer requirement. According to California law, neither a bank nor any majority-owned subsidiary of a bank may make a distribution to its shareholders in an amount which exceeds the lesser of (i) the bank’s retained earnings or (ii) the bank’s net income for its last three fiscal years, less the amount of any distributions made by the bank or by any majority-owned subsidiary of the bank during such period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a bank may, with the prior approval of the DBO, make a distribution to the shareholders of the bank in an amount not exceeding the greatest of: (i) the bank’s retained earnings; (ii) the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year; or (iii) the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year. Dividends payable by the Bank can be limited or prohibited if the Bank does not meet the capital conservation buffer requirement. Federal law further provides that no insured depository institution may make any capital distribution (which includes a cash dividend) if, after making the distribution, the institution would be “undercapitalized,” as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations. In addition, under federal law, a Federal Reserve member bank, such as the Bank, may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during the calendar year, including a proposed dividend, exceeds the sum of the Bank’s net income during the calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two calendar years, unless the dividend has been approved by the Federal Reserve. Moreover, the federal bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice and failure to meet the capital conservation buffer requirement will result in restrictions on dividends. 
  Privacy Standards.   The Bank is subject to federal regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. These regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of their information sharing practices and informing consumers of their rights to opt out of certain practices. 
  Anti-Money Laundering and Client Identification.   The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“USA Patriot Act”) and the Bank Secrecy Act require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, 

 20

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of clients seeking to open new financial accounts, and, effective in 2018, the beneficial owners of accounts. Bank regulators are directed to consider an institution’s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on applications under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHCA”) and the Bank Merger Act. We believe that the Bank’s policies and procedures comply with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act. 
  Other Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations.   The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB and empowered it to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. Banks are subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a financial institution with assets of less than $10 billion, the Bank is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the Federal Reserve and the DBO with respect to our compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations. 
 The Bank is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers. While the list set forth below is not exhaustive, these include the Truth-in-Lending Act, Truth in Savings Act, Electronic Fund Transfers Act, Expedited Funds Availability Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Housing Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Right to Financial Privacy Act, Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, Fair Credit Billing Act, Homeowners Protection Act, Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights. 
 BayCom Corp 
  General.   The Company, as sole shareholder of the Bank, is a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve. Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve under the under the BHCA, and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. We are required to file quarterly reports with the Federal Reserve and to provide additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve may examine us or any of our subsidiaries, and charge us for the cost of the examination. The Federal Reserve also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. The Company is also be required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
  The Bank Holding Company Act.   Under the BHCA, we are supervised by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has a long-standing policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks by having the ability to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial distress. A bank holding company’s failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve’s regulations, or both. No regulations have yet been proposed by the Federal Reserve to implement the source of strength provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Company and any subsidiaries that it may control are considered “affiliates” of the Bank within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between the Bank and affiliates are subject to numerous restrictions. With some exceptions, the Company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from tying the provision of various services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by the Company or by its affiliates.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Acquisitions.   An acquisition of the Company or the Bank, an acquisition of control of either, or an acquisition by either of another bank holding company or depository institution or control of such a company or institution is generally subject to prior approval by applicable federal and state banking regulators, as are certain acquisitions by the Company or the Bank of other types of entities, as discussed below. “Control” is defined in various ways for this purpose, including but not limited to control of 10% of outstanding voting stock of an entity. Acquisitions by the Bank of branches are also subject to similar prior approval requirements. 
 The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company, and from engaging in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. Under the BHCA, the Federal Reserve may approve the ownership of shares by a bank holding company in any company, the activities of which the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. These activities include: operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers’ checks and U.S. Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for clients. 
  Federal Securities Laws.   The Company’s common stock is registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We are subject to information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). 
  The Dodd-Frank Act.   The Dodd-Frank-Act imposed new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for depository institutions and their holding companies, and capital requirements that are discussed above under the section entitled “Capital Requirements.” 
 In addition, among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to (i) provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote (a) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers and (b) at least once every six years on whether they should have a “say on pay” vote every one, two or three years; (ii) have a separate, non-binding shareholder vote regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; (iii) provide disclosure in annual proxy materials concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer; and (iv) disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer’s annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. The company as an “emerging growth company,” unlike other public companies that are not emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act, will not be required to comply with the foregoing disclosure requirements for as long as it maintains its emerging growth company status. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, (ii) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the Exchange Act. 
 The regulations to implement the provisions of Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule, contain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of financial institutions holding companies and their affiliates to engage in proprietary trading and to hold certain interests in, or to have certain relationships with, various types of investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. The Company is continuously reviewing its investment portfolio to determine if changes in its investment strategies are in compliance with the various provisions of the Volcker Rule regulations.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 For certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, implementing regulations have not been promulgated, so the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the company cannot be determined at this time. For information on the Economic Growth Act, which amended the Dodd-Frank Act, see “2018 Reforms” above. 
  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.   As a public company that files periodic reports with the SEC, under the Exchange Act, BayCom is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees. Our policies and procedures are designed to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
  Interstate Banking and Branching.   The Federal Reserve must approve an application of a bank holding company to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located in a state other than the holding company’s home state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. The Federal Reserve may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period (not exceeding five years) specified by the statutory law of the host state. Nor may the Federal Reserve approve an application if the applicant (and its depository institution affiliates) controls or would control more than 10% of the insured deposits in the United States or 30% or more of the deposits in the target bank’s home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch. Federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state which may be held or controlled by a bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies. Individual states may also waive the 30% state-wide concentration limit contained in the federal law. 
 The federal banking agencies are generally authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the law of any state. Interstate acquisitions of branches are permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. Interstate mergers and branch acquisitions are subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration amounts described above. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking agencies may generally approve interstate de novo branching. 
  Dividends.   The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses its view that although there are no specific regulations restricting dividend payments by bank holding companies other than state corporate laws. A bank holding company must maintain an adequate capital position and generally should not pay cash dividends unless the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to fully fund the cash dividends and that the prospective rate of earnings appears consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve policy statement also indicates that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. As described above under “Capital Requirements,” the capital conversion buffer requirement can also restrict the Company’s ability to pay dividends. 
  Stock Repurchases.   Except for certain “well-capitalized” and highly rated bank holding companies, a bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months, is equal to 10% or more of its consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice, violate any law or regulation, Federal Reserve order, any condition imposed by or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. 
Competition 
 The financial services industry is highly competitive as we compete for loans, deposits and client relationships in our market. We compete for loans, deposits, and financial services in all of our principal markets. We compete directly with other bank and nonbank institutions, including credit unions, located 

 23

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 within our markets, internet-based banks, and “FinTech” companies that rely on technology to provide financial services, out of market banks, and bank holding companies that advertise in or otherwise serve our markets, along with money market and mutual funds, brokerage houses, mortgage companies, and insurance companies or other commercial entities that offer financial services products. Competition involves efforts to retain current clients, make new loans and obtain new deposits, increase the scope and sophistication of services offered and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans. 
 In commercial banking, we face competition to underwrite loans to sound, stable businesses and real estate projects at competitive price levels that make sense for our business and risk profile. Our major competitors include larger national, regional and local financial institutions and other providers of financial services, including finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, that may have the ability to make loans on larger projects than we can or provide a larger mix of product offerings. We also compete with smaller local financial institutions that may have aggressive pricing and unique terms on various types of loans and, increasingly, FinTech companies that offer their products exclusively through web-based portals. 
 In retail banking, we primarily compete for deposits with national and local banks and credit unions that have visible retail presence and personnel in our market areas. The primary factors driving competition for deposits are client service, interest rates, fees charged, branch location and hours of operation and the range of products offered. We compete for deposits by advertising, offering competitive interest rates and seeking to provide a higher level of personal service. 
 Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages, including greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer additional services, more favorable pricing alternatives, and lower origination and operating costs. Some of our competitors have been in business for a long time and have an established client base and name recognition. We believe that our competitive pricing, personalized service, and community involvement enable us to effectively compete in the communities in which we operate. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 We operate in a highly regulated environment. From time to time we are a party to various litigation matters incidental to the conduct of our business. We are not presently party to any legal proceedings where we believe the resolution would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operation, cash flows or capital levels. 
 Nevertheless, given the nature, scope and complexity of the extensive legal and regulatory landscape applicable to our business (including laws and regulations governing consumer protection, fair lending, fair labor, privacy, information security and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws), we, like all banking organizations, are subject to heightened legal and regulatory compliance and litigation risk. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 214 full-time equivalent employees. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or is a party to a collective bargaining agreement. 
Corporate Information 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 500 Ygnacio Valley Road, Suite 200, Walnut Creek, California 94596. Our telephone number is (925) 476-1800. 
 We maintain a website with the address www.unitedbusinessbank.com.
