 Overview
 Established in 2002, Vince is a global luxury apparel and accessories brand best known for creating elevated yet understated pieces for every day. The collections are inspired by the brand’s California origins and embody a feeling of warm and effortless style.  Vince designs uncomplicated yet refined pieces that approach dressing with a sense of ease.  Known for its range of luxury products, Vince offers wide array of women’s and men’s ready-to-wear, shoes, and capsule collection of handbags, and home for a global lifestyle. Vince products are sold in prestige distribution worldwide, including approximately 2,000 distribution locations across more than 40 countries. We have a small number of wholesale partners who account for a significant portion of our net sales. In fiscal 2018, sales to two wholesale partners, Nordstrom Inc., and Neiman Marcus Group LTD, each accounted for more than ten percent of the Company’s net sales. These sales represented 33.7% of fiscal 2018 net sales. In fiscal 2017, sales to one wholesale partner, Nordstrom, accounted for more than ten percent of the Company’s net sales. These sales represented 21.9% of fiscal 2017 net sales. In fiscal 2016, sales to three wholesale partners, Nordstrom, Hudson’s Bay Company, and Neiman Marcus Group, each accounted for more than ten percent of the Company’s net sales. These sales represented 45% of fiscal 2016 net sales. 
 We design our products in the U.S. and source the vast majority of our products from contract manufacturers outside the U.S., primarily in Asia.
 We serve our customers through a variety of channels that reinforce the Vince brand image. Our diversified channel strategy allows us to introduce our products to customers through multiple distribution points that are reported in two segments: Wholesale and Direct-to-consumer. Our Wholesale segment is comprised of sales to major department stores and specialty stores in the U.S. and in select international markets, with U.S. wholesale representing 47%, 51% and 51% of our fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 net sales, respectively, and the total Wholesale segment representing 57%, 61% and 63% of net sales for the same periods. International wholesale represented 9%, 9% and 10% of net sales for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. Our Wholesale segment also includes our licensing business related to our licensing arrangement for our women’s and men’s footwear. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we entered into limited distribution arrangements with Nordstrom. and Neiman Marcus Group for non-licensed product in order to rationalize our department store distribution strategy which is intended to improve profitability in the Wholesale segment and to enable us to focus on other areas of growth for the brand, particularly in the Direct-to-consumer segment. We implemented various strategic initiatives to capture the sales from exited wholesale doors through our retail and e-commerce businesses while collaborating with the wholesale partners in various areas including merchandising and logistics to build a more profitable and focused wholesale business.
 Our Direct-to-consumer segment includes our company-operated retail and outlet stores and our e-commerce business. During fiscal 2018, we opened net four new full-price retail stores. As of February 2, 2019, we operated 59 stores, consisting of 45 company-operated full-price retail stores and 14 company-operated outlet locations. The Direct-to-consumer segment also includes our e-commerce website, www.vince.com. The Direct-to-consumer segment accounted for 43%, 39% and 37% of fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 net sales, respectively. 
 Vince operates on a fiscal calendar widely used by the retail industry that results in a given fiscal year consisting of a 52 or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31.

Marketing, Advertising and Public Relations
 We use marketing, advertising and public relations as critical tools to deliver a consistent and compelling brand message to consumers. Our brand message and marketing strategies are cultivated by dedicated creative, design, marketing, visual merchandising and public relations teams. These teams work closely together to develop and execute campaigns that appeal to both our core and aspirational customers.
 To execute our marketing strategies, we engage in a wide range of campaign tactics that include traditional media (such as direct mail, print advertising, cooperative advertising with wholesale partners and outdoor advertising), digital media (such as email, search and social display) and experiential campaigns (such as events and collection previews) to drive traffic, brand awareness, conversion and ultimately sales across all channels. In addition, we use social platforms such as Instagram and Facebook to engage customers and create excitement about our brand. The visits to www.vince.com, which totaled approximately 7.7 million in fiscal 2018, also provide an opportunity to grow our customer base and communicate directly with our customers.
 Our public relations team conducts a wide variety of press activities to reinforce the Vince brand image and create excitement around the brand. Vince apparel and footwear have appeared in the pages of major fashion magazines such as Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, Elle, W, GQ, Esquire and WSJ. Well-known trend setters in entertainment and fashion are also regularly seen wearing the Vince brand.
 Sourcing and Manufacturing
 Vince does not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We contract for the purchase of finished goods with manufacturers who are responsible for the entire manufacturing process, including the purchase of piece goods and trim. Although we do not have long-term written contracts with manufacturers, we have long-standing relationships with a diverse base of vendors which we believe to be mutually satisfactory. We work with more than 40 manufacturers across nine countries, with 88.0% of our products produced in China in fiscal 2018. For cost and control purposes, we contract with select third-party vendors in the U.S. to produce a small portion of our merchandise.
 All of our garments are produced according to our specifications, and we require that all of our manufacturers adhere to strict regulatory compliance and standards of conduct. Our vendors’ factories are monitored by our production team to ensure quality control, and they are monitored by independent third-party inspectors we employ for compliance with local manufacturing standards and regulations on an annual basis. We also monitor our vendors’ manufacturing facilities regularly, providing technical assistance and performing in-line and final audits to ensure the highest possible quality.
 Shared Services Agreement
 In connection with the consummation of the IPO, Vince, LLC entered into a Shared Services Agreement with Kellwood Company, LLC on November 27, 2013 (the “Shared Services Agreement”) pursuant to which Kellwood provided support services in various areas including, among other things, certain accounting functions, tax, e-commerce operations, distribution, logistics, information technology, accounts payable, credit and collections and payroll and benefits administration. As of the end of fiscal 2016, we had completed the transition of all such functions and systems from Kellwood to our own systems or processes as well as to third-party service providers. Refer to the discussion under “Information Systems” below for further information on our transition of information technology systems and infrastructure in-house from Kellwood. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors— We are continuing to optimize and improve our recently implemented information technology systems, processes and functions. If these systems, processes and functions do not operate successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially harmed.” In addition, see “Shared Services Agreement” under Note 12 “Related Party Transactions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
 In connection with the Kellwood Sale, the Shared Services Agreement was contributed to St. Louis, LLC. The Shared Services Agreement with St. Louis, LLC has effectively terminated in fiscal 2017 as there are currently no outstanding or further services to be provided thereunder.

Distribution Facilities
 As of February 2, 2019, we operated out of three distribution centers, one located in the U.S., one in Hong Kong and one in Belgium. Our warehouse in the U.S., located in City of Industry, California, is operated by a third-party logistics provider and includes approximately 130,000 square feet dedicated to fulfilling orders for our wholesale partners, retail locations and e-commerce business and utilizes warehouse management systems that are fully customer and vendor compliant. 
 Our warehouse in Hong Kong is operated by a third-party logistics provider and supports our wholesale orders for international customers located primarily in Asia. 
 Our warehouse in Belgium is operated by a third-party logistics provider and supports our wholesale orders for international customers located primarily in Europe. 
 We believe we have sufficient capacity in our domestic and international distribution facilities to support our current and projected business.
 Information Systems
 Our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system is Microsoft Dynamics AX and is cloud based and integrates with our point-of-sale (“POS”) system, e-commerce platform and other supporting systems. 
 Collectively, these systems replaced all systems used under the Shared Services Agreement. Until recently, we relied on certain systems and information technology services of Kellwood pursuant to the terms of the Shared Services Agreement. These services historically included information technology planning and administration, desktop support and help desk, our ERP system, financial applications, warehouse systems, reporting and analysis applications and our retail and e-commerce interfaces. 
 Since the IPO, we had been working on transitioning these systems and information technology services from Kellwood and as of the end of fiscal 2016, we completed the transition of all such systems from Kellwood to our own systems. This included the implementation of our own ERP and supporting systems, POS system, third-party e-commerce platform, distribution applications, network infrastructure and related IT support services, and human resource payroll and recruitment systems. We no longer rely on Kellwood’s information technology services. 
 See “Shared Services Agreement,” above, Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors— We are continuing to optimize and improve our recently implemented information technology systems, processes and functions. If these systems, processes and functions do not operate successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially harmed” and Part II, Item 9A. “Controls and Procedures.” In addition, see “Shared Services Agreement” under Note 12 “Related Party Transactions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on form 10-K for further information.
 Seasonality
 The apparel and fashion industry in which we operate is cyclical and, consequently, our revenues are affected by general economic conditions and the seasonal trends characteristic to the apparel and fashion industry. Purchases of apparel are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the level of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates and consumer confidence as well as the impact of adverse weather conditions. In addition, fluctuations in the amount of sales in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting direct-to-consumer sales. As such, the financial results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the fiscal year. We expect such seasonality to continue.
Competition
 We face strong competition in each of the product categories and markets in which we compete on the basis of style, quality, price and brand recognition. Some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial, marketing, distribution and other resources compared to us. However, we believe that we have established a sustainable and distinct position in the current marketplace, driven by a product assortment that combines classic and fashion-forward styling, and a pricing strategy that offers customers accessible luxury. Our competitors are varied, but include Theory, Helmut Lang, Rag & Bone, A.L.C., Veronica Beard, among others.
Employees
 As of February 2, 2019, we had 599 employees, of which 370 were employed in our company-operated retail stores. Except for 10 employees in France, who are covered by collective bargaining agreements pursuant to French law, none of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our employee relations are good.
