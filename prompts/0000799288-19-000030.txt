Lands' End is an iconic American brand and a leading multi-channel retailer of casual clothing, accessories and footwear, as well as home products. Operating out of America’s heartland, our vision and values make a strong connection with our core customers. We offer products through catalogs, online at www.landsend.com, on international websites, third-party online marketplaces, and through retail locations. We have a passion for delivering quality products, uncompromising service and exceptional value to our customers and we seek to deliver timeless style for women, men, kids and the home. 
Lands' End was founded in 1963 by Gary Comer and his partners to sell sailboat hardware and equipment by catalog. While our product focus has shifted significantly over the years, we have continued to adhere to our founder's motto as one of our guiding principles: "Take care of the customer, take care of the employee and the rest will take care of itself."
As discussed more fully in the strategy section, Lands’ End is a leading multi-channel retailer of casual clothing, accessories and footwear, as well as home products.  Lands’ End is building a multi-channel distribution network 

2

seeking to provide a common customer experience regardless of whether they are interacting with us on our company websites, third party marketplaces, at company owned stores or other distribution outlets. As we evolve our multi-channel strategy, and in conjunction with the accelerated closures of Lands' End Shops at Sears, during Fiscal 2018 we determined it was more appropriate to combine the previously disclosed external reportable segments of Direct and Retail, into one combined external reportable segment as it more closely represents how we are managing the Company.  We identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. Our operating segments consist of U.S. eCommerce, Retail, Lands' End Outfitters ("Outfitters"), Europe eCommerce and Japan eCommerce. We have determined that each of our operating segments share similar economic and other qualitative characteristics, and therefore the results of our operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment.
Lands' End's product channels are eCommerce, Retail and Outfitters. eCommerce offers products through the Company's eCommerce websites, third party online marketplaces and direct mail catalogs. Retail sells products and services through Company Operated stores and through dedicated Lands' End Shops at Sears. Outfitters sells products to end consumers, located primarily in the United States, through negotiated arrangements with client organizations to make specific styles or embroidered products available to members of client organizations. 
In Fiscal 2018, we generated revenue of approximately $1.45 billion. Our revenue is generated worldwide through an international, multi-channel network based in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Japan. This network reinforces and supports sales across the multiple channels in which we do business. Net revenue is presented by product channel in the following table:

Strategy
In Fiscal 2018, we continued to leverage our iconic American brand, which was founded on the principles of delivering great quality, uncompromising service and exceptional value to our customers. In Fiscal 2019 we plan to continue the momentum through four major growth initiatives that have been our focus over the past two years:
Product. The soul of the Lands’ End brand has always been products with a purpose. We are focused on delivering key items, made of quality materials, in iconic styles that offer great value to our customers and their families. We provide an assortment of products leveraging our key item strategy with a focus on delivering comfort, style and value with emphasis on major categories. In Fiscal 2019 we plan to continue to leverage customer data to drive decisions around our merchandise assortment, fabrics, silhouettes and price points that our customer desires. We have worked to standardize our fits across multiple categories and classifications. We are also focused on key partnerships, including growing our uniform business with the innovative products to meet the needs of our partners.
Digital. We are focused on utilizing digital technologies to obtain new customers and improve the overall customer experience, including leveraging data analytics to better tailor and personalize the shopping experience for each customer. We are becoming a digitally-led organization, applying technology as we adapt to ongoing shifts in customer shopping behaviors. During Fiscal 2018, we improved our search engine optimization, improved mobile site speed and implemented price clarity. We enhanced our website with updated product descriptions that better align with the language that our customers use when searching for products. We also enhanced our smartphone experience, as this is the device our customer increasingly prefers. As a part of our Fiscal 2019 initiatives we are focused on continuing to improve the customer’s smartphone experience, including improved product presentation and a faster website.
Distribution. We utilize multi-point distribution, including our traditional catalogs, eCommerce and retail stores, to engage our customer where and how they choose to shop. Our stores represent the Lands’ End American Heritage aesthetic, making it easy for our customers to find our products in an inviting, brand appropriate setting. For Fiscal 2019 and beyond, we plan to apply a customer analytics-driven distribution strategy, where we leverage our data to refine product assortment, target store locations, and explore opportunities with third party marketplaces.
Business Process. We continue to focus on building strategic competencies through improved business processes that are based on standardization and efficiency. As we enter Fiscal 2019, we are nearing completion of our ERP implementation, beginning the implementation of our Enterprise Order Management ("EOM") system and scoping of a Warehouse Management System solution. We also plan to focus on optimizing our logistics and transportation capabilities, which will further enable us to upgrade the way we take, process and fulfill orders across our enterprise. Additionally, we plan to continue to upgrade our inventory planning process and data analytic capabilities as we focus on growing the business and operating as a global multi-channel retailer.
Key Capabilities
Lands' End was founded on certain principles of doing business that are embodied in our goal to deliver great quality, uncompromising service and exceptional value to our customers. These core principles of quality, service and value are the foundation of what we believe distinguish us from our competitors, including:
Customer base. Lands' End is an iconic American brand with a large and loyal customer base. Operating out of Wisconsin, in the heartland of the United States, our vision and values make a strong connection with our core customer. In Fiscal 2018, we grew the brand by reconnecting with those core customers. We believe that a principal indicator of our success to date has been the continued growth of our buyer file in Fiscal 2018, with increases in new and retained customers. 
Product innovation. We seek to develop new, innovative products for our customers by utilizing modern fabrics and quality construction to create timeless, affordable styles with excellent fits. We also seek to present our products in an engaging and inspiring way. We believe that our typical customers value quality, seek good value for their money and are looking to add classics to their wardrobe while also placing an emphasis on comfort, functionality and product innovation that supports their lifestyle. From a design and merchandising perspective, we believe that we have had success adding relevant items into our product assortment, many of which have become customer favorites. We devote significant time and resources to quality assurance, fit testing and product compliance. Our in-house team manages all product specifications and seeks to ensure brand integrity by providing our customers with the consistent, high-quality merchandise for which Lands' End is known. We are a vertically integrated retailer that manages all aspects of our 

4

design, marketing and distribution in-house, which provides us with maximum control over the promotion and sale of our products.
Customer service. We are committed to building on Lands' End's legacy of strong customer service. We believe we have a strong track record of improving the customer service experience through innovation. Today, Lands' End is focused on using our extensive customer data to make the shopping experience as effortless and personalized as possible, regardless of whether our customers shop online or in one of our retail locations. Our operations, including prompt order fulfillment, responsiveness to our customers' requests and our customer friendly return policy, have contributed to our award-winning customer service, which we believe is one of our core strengths and a key point of differentiation from our competitors. We have received many accolades over the years and most recently, received the following:

• | Lands’ End was included in the Newsweek list of America’s Best Customer Service 2019, ranking No.1 for best customer service in the Online Retailers: Clothing in the Apparel category (November 2018)

• | Land's End Named Customer Experience Leader, Source: Mulitchannel Merchant (March 2017)


• | Lands' End Named Customer Service Champion, Source: Prosper Insights & Analytics. Featured on Forbes.com (August 2017)

Marketing
We believe that our most important asset is our brand. The Lands' End brand is well-recognized with a deeply rooted tradition of offering excellent quality, value and service along with the Lands' End return policy. We seek to reflect that tradition in all of our merchandise. We also invest significantly in brand development through our focus on providing excellent customer service and our emphasis on digital transformation and innovative product development. We believe that this commitment to our brand has helped to generate our large and loyal customer base for over fifty years.
We attempt to build on our brand recognition through multi-channel marketing campaigns including an eCommerce website, www.landsend.com, catalog distribution, digital marketing and social media. Creative designs for these marketing platforms are primarily developed in-house by our creative team. We strive to be efficient in our overall spend, enabling us to invest in initiatives that we believe will yield benefits over the longer-term. We expect the majority of our marketing spend to be allocated to digital marketing and our catalog, where we believe we can generate near term return on investment. We are also seeking to enhance our branding initiatives by investing in strategic partnerships designed to showcase our apparel and personalizing promotions offered to customers.
Information Technology
Our information technology systems provide comprehensive support for the design, merchandising, importing, marketing, distribution, sales, order processing and order fulfillment of our Lands' End products. We have a dedicated information technology team that provides strategic direction, application development, infrastructure services and systems support for the functions and processes of our business. The information technology team contracts with third-party consulting firms to provide cost-effective staff augmentation services and partners with leading hardware, software and cloud-based technology firms to provide the infrastructure necessary to run and operate our systems. Our core software applications are comprised of a combination of internally developed and packaged third-party systems. The eCommerce solutions powering www.landsend.com, the Outfitters websites, and our international Lands' End websites are operated out of our own internal data centers, as well as through hosting relationships with third parties and industry-leading cloud providers.
We are in the process of implementing new information technology systems as part of a multi-year plan to expand and upgrade our information technology platforms and infrastructure. In Fiscal 2018, we implemented several financial, merchandising and inventory planning capabilities as part of our ERP implementation along with key enhancements to our eCommerce shopping experiences. We intend to build off these core capabilities to drive future improvements in our operations.
In Fiscal 2019, we intend to continue to pursue additional strategic investments, including fully rolling out our ERP platform. We plan to begin work on EOM and continue to improve on our digital capabilities including enhanced mobile experiences, personalization, data science, and continue enhancements to the digital shopping experiences on our eCommerce platforms. In addition, we intend to invest in digital solutions to augment the customer and sales associate experiences within our Company Operated stores.

The nearly complete ERP platform implementation combined with the implementation of the EOM platform is expected to create efficiencies within our internal processes and reporting. However, implementation of these solutions and systems is highly dependent on coordination of numerous software, hardware, cloud and system integration providers. See also Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
We operate primarily in the apparel industry which is highly competitive. We compete with a diverse group of direct-to-consumer companies and retailers, including national department store chains, men's and women's specialty apparel chains, outdoor specialty stores, apparel catalog businesses, sportswear marketers and online apparel businesses that sell similar lines of merchandise. We compete principally on the basis of merchandise value (quality and price), product innovation, our established customer list and award-winning customer service, which includes reliable order fulfillment, our return policy and services, and information provided at our user-friendly websites.
Seasonality
We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net revenue and operating results and historically have realized a significant portion of our net revenue and earnings for the year during our fourth fiscal quarter. We generated 34.6%, 36.3% and 34.4% of our net revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter of Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively. Thus, lower than expected fourth quarter net revenue could have an adverse impact on our annual operating results.
Working capital requirements typically increase during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year as inventory builds to support peak shipping/selling periods and, accordingly, working capital requirements typically decreases during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year as inventory is shipped/sold. Cash provided by operating activities is typically higher in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to reduced working capital requirements during that period.
Vendors
Our products are produced globally by independent manufacturers who are selected, monitored and coordinated by the Lands' End Global Sourcing team based in Dodgeville, Wisconsin and other third-party buying agents. Our products are manufactured in approximately 30 countries and the majority are imported from Asia and South America, depending on the nature of the product mix. In Fiscal 2018 our top 10 vendors accounted for approximately 40% of the value of our merchandise purchases and we worked with approximately 200 vendors that manufactured substantially all of our products. We generally do not enter into long-term merchandise supply contracts. We continue to take advantage of opportunities to more efficiently source our products worldwide, consistent with our high standards of quality and value. Significant areas of non-product spend include transportation, information systems, marketing, packaging and catalog paper and print. 
It is important to us that our partners share the same values in business as we do, therefore, we require that the vendors comply with applicable legal requirements, agree to our global compliance requirements and meet our product quality standards. Our vendors are required to provide us with full access to their facilities and to relevant records relating to their employment practices, such as, but not limited to, child labor, wages and benefits, forced labor, discrimination, freedom of association, unlawful inducements, safe and healthy working conditions and other business practices so that we may monitor their compliance with ethical and legal requirements relating to the conduct of their business.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
We purchase, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to our operations from numerous suppliers around the world, including in the United States. There have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages.
Distribution
We own and operate three distribution centers in Wisconsin. Our Dodgeville facility is approximately 1.1 million square feet and is a full-service distribution center, including monogramming, hemming and embroidery services. Our Reedsburg location is approximately 400,000 square feet and offers all order fulfillment services except hemming. Our Stevens Point distribution center is approximately 150,000 square feet and primarily focuses on embroidery services. Customer orders are shipped via third parties.
We own and operate a distribution center in the United Kingdom based in Oakham, a community north of London. Order fulfillment and specialty services for our European businesses are performed at this facility, which opened in 1998 and totals approximately 175,000 square feet. We also lease a 56,000 square foot distribution center in Fujieda, Japan.

6

Orders are generally filled on a current basis, and order backlog is not material to our business.
Intellectual Property
Lands' End owns or has rights to use certain word and design trademarks, service marks, and trade names that are registered or exist under common law in the United States and other jurisdictions. The Lands' End® trade name and trademark is used both in the United States and internationally, and is material to our business. Trademarks that are important in identifying and distinguishing our products and services are Guaranteed. Period.®, Lighthouse by Lands' End™, Square Rigger™, Squall®, Super-T™, Drifter™, Outrigger®, Marinac®, and Beach Living®, all of which are owned by us, as well as the licensed marks Supima®, No-Gape®, and others. Other recognized trademarks owned by Lands' End include SwimMates™, Starfish™, Iron Knees®, Hyde Park®, Year’ Rounder®, ClassMate®, Pink Thread Project®, Willis & Geiger® and ThermaCheck®. Lands' End's rights to some of these trademarks are limited to select markets.
Employees 
We employ approximately 5,000 employees throughout our operations: approximately 4,200 employees in the United States and approximately 800 employees outside the United States. This workforce is comprised of approximately 20% salaried employees, 41% hourly employees and 39% part-time employees. With the seasonal nature of the retail industry, over 2,000 additional, flexible, part-time employees join us each year to support our varying peak seasons, including the fourth quarter holiday shopping season.
Pledged Assets
All obligations under the Debt Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by Lands' End, Inc. and, subject to certain exceptions, each of its existing and future direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. The ABL Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in certain working capital of the borrowers and guarantors consisting primarily of accounts receivable and inventory. The Term Loan Facility is secured by a second priority security interest in the same collateral, with certain exceptions.
The Term Loan Facility also is secured by a first priority security interest in certain property and assets of the borrowers and guarantors, including certain fixed assets and stock of subsidiaries. The ABL Facility is secured by a second priority security interest in the same collateral.
Corporate Citizenship
Sustainability Initiatives. Lands' End is working towards improving its sustainable footprint through key practices like waste reduction, purchasing recycled consumables and through corporate partnerships. Lands' End hopes to inspire customers and other corporations to increase sustainability awareness and initiatives.
We have a focus on raising awareness and educating associates on reducing our internal use of consumables and natural resources. In addition, we have a broad range of recycling and waste management initiatives at our corporate office and distribution centers to address our use of paper products, aluminum cans, glass, electronics and plastic as well as maintenance operations, disposal of non-recyclables with composting and water management. 
Additionally, we believe that we also demonstrate marketplace leadership by participating in industry educational workshops and initiatives. Lands' End has formed strategic partnerships with organizations like the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, bluesign, National Forest Foundation, where we have helped plant over 1 million trees, and the Clean Lakes Alliance, where we help protect and improve maintenance of local lakes in Wisconsin. These partnerships, which respectively operate globally, nationally, and locally allow us to engage at a variety of levels. 
History 
We were founded in 1963, incorporated in Delaware in 1986 and our common stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange from 1986 to 2002. On June 17, 2002, we became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sears Roebuck. Sears Holdings distributed 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of Lands' End to its stockholders on April 4, 2014.
According to statements on form Schedule 13D filed with the SEC by ESL, ESL beneficially owned significant portions of both the Company's and Sears Holdings' outstanding shares of common stock. Therefore, Sears Holdings, the Company's former parent company, is considered a related party both prior to and subsequent to the Separation. On February 11, 2019, Transform Holdco acquired from Sears Holdings substantially all of the go-forward retail footprint and other assets and component businesses of Sears Holdings as a going concern. We believe that ESL holds a significant portion of the membership interests of Transform Holdco and therefore consider that entity to be a related party as well.

7

In connection with and subsequent to the Separation, we entered into various agreements with Sears Holdings or its subsidiaries that govern our relationship with Sears Holdings with respect to the Lands' End Shops at Sears, various general corporate services, and other relationships. At this time we cannot predict if these agreements will be assumed by and assigned to Transform Holdco. See Note 11, Related Party Agreements and Transactions.
