Item 1 - BUSINESS
 
Overview of the Company
 
The Company is a leading manufacturer of flexible metal hose, which is used in a variety of ways to carry gases and liquids within their particular applications. Some of the more prominent uses include:
 

● | carrying fuel gases within residential and commercial buildings; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | carrying gasoline and diesel gasoline products (both above and below the ground) in a double containment piping to contain any possible leaks, which is used in automotive and marina refueling, and fueling for back-up generation; 
● | using copper-alloy corrugated piping in medical or health care facilities to carry medical gases (oxygen, nitrogen, vacuum) or pure gases for pharmaceutical applications; and 
● | industrial applications where the customer requires the piping to have both a degree of flexibility and/or an ability to carry corrosive compounds or mixtures, or to carry at both very high and very low (cryogenic) temperatures. 

 
The Company’s business is managed as a single operating segment that consists of the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose (also described as corrugated tubing), as well as the sale of the Company’s related proprietary fittings and a vast array of accessories.
 
The Company manufactures flexible metal hose at its facilities in Exton, Pennsylvania, and Houston, Texas in the United States (U.S.), and in Banbury, Oxfordshire in the United Kingdom (U.K.). The Company primarily sells its products through distributors, wholesalers and to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) throughout North America and Europe, and to a lesser extent other global markets.

Industry Overview
 
The flexible metal hose industry is highly fragmented and diverse, with more than 10 companies producing flexible metal hose in the U.S., and at least that many in Europe and Asia. Because of its simple and ubiquitous nature, flexible metal hose has been applied to a number of different applications across a broad range of industries.
 
The major market categories for flexible metallic hose include (1) automotive, (2) aerospace, (3) residential, commercial, and institutional construction, and (4) general industrial. Omega Flex participates in the latter two markets for flexible metallic hose. The residential and commercial construction markets utilize corrugated stainless steel tubing (CSST) primarily for flexible gas piping, double containment piping for conveying diesel fuel and gasoline from a storage tank to a dispenser or back-up generator. The Company utilizes corrugated copper tubing for medical gases in medical care facilities, including hospitals, clinics, dental and veterinary offices, and long-term care facilities. The general industrial market includes all the processing industries, the most important of which include primary steel, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and specialty applications for the transfer of fluids at both extremely low and high temperatures, (such as the conveying of cryogenic liquids) and a highly fragmented OEM market, as well as the maintenance and repair market.
 
None of our competitors appear to be dominant in more than one market. We are a leading supplier of flexible metal hose in each of the markets in which we participate. Our assessment of our overall competitive position is based on several factors. The flexible gas piping market in the U.S. is currently concentrated in the residential housing market. Based on the reports issued by the national trade groups on housing construction, the level of acceptance of flexible gas piping in the construction market, and the average usage of flexible gas piping in a residential building, we believe that we can estimate with a reasonable level of accuracy the size of the total gas piping market. In addition, the Company is a member of an industry trade group comprised of the largest manufacturers of CSST in the U.S., which compiles and distributes sales volume statistics for its members relative to flexible gas piping. Based on our sales and the statistics described above, the Company believes it can estimate its position within that market. For other applications, industry trade groups collect, and report data related to these markets, and we can then compare and estimate our status within that group as a whole. In addition, the customer base for the products that we sell, and the identity of the manufacturers aligned with those customers is fairly well known, which again allows the Company to extract information and estimate its market position. Lastly, the term “leading” implies a host of factors other than sales volume and market share position. It includes the range and capability of the product line, history of product development and new product launches, all of which information is in the public domain. Based on all this information, the Company is reasonably confident that it is indeed a leader in the major market segments in which it participates.
 
Development of Business
 
Incorporated in 1975 under the name of Tofle America, Inc., the Company was originally established as the subsidiary of a Japanese manufacturer of flexible metal hose. For a number of years, the Company was a manufacturer of flexible metal hose that was sold primarily to customers using the hose for incorporation into finished assemblies for industrial applications. The Company later changed its name to Omega Flex, Inc., and in 1996, the Company was acquired by Mestek, Inc. (Mestek).
 
In January 2005, Mestek announced its intention to distribute its equity ownership in our common stock to Mestek shareholders. A registration statement for the Omega Flex common stock was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the registration statement was declared effective on July 22, 2005. The Company also listed its common stock on the NASDAQ National Market (now the NASDAQ Global Market) under the stock symbol “OFLX” and began public trading of the common stock on August 1, 2005.
 
Over the years, most of the Company’s business has been concentrated in North America, but the Company also has foreign subsidiaries located in the U.K. and France, which are largely focused on European and other international markets. The Company also has a U.S. subsidiary which owns the Company’s Exton, Pennsylvania real estate.

Overview of Current Business
 
Strategy
 
The Company’s strategy has been, and continues to be, focused on its core strengths in the development, manufacture, and sale of flexible metal hose for use in a variety of applications. The Company is uniquely situated to exploit its capabilities in this area due to its long experience in engineering and bringing new products to market, and its proprietary rotary process, which permits the Company to manufacture flexible metal hose with superior quality and efficiency as compared to its competitors. The Company’s strategy is to develop flexible metal products in new and developing markets that would recognize and compensate for the value-added propositions that each product brings to that industry. Typically, this would involve a new flexible metal hose that replaces traditional rigid products, and thereby improve the quality of the installed product, increase installation efficiency, and provide an overall cost and time savings. Examples of such new products are our flexible gas piping sold under the TracPipe ® CounterStrike® trademarks, our new MediTrac® corrugated medical gas tubing, and our DoubleTrac® double-containment piping. In each instance, the products we bring to market offers customers superior quality, expanded applications due to the product’s flexibility, and reduced total costs. The Company seeks to protect its investments in product development by seeking and obtaining patent protection for new and unique features of its products.
Sales, Products and Customers
 
We sell our products to customers scattered across a wide and diverse set of industries ranging from construction to pharmaceutical with close to 10,400 customers on record. These sales channels include sales through independent sales representatives, distributors, OEM, and direct sales. We utilize various distribution companies in the sale of our TracPipe® and Counterstrike® flexible gas piping, and these distribution customers in the aggregate represent a significant portion of our business. In particular, the Company has one significant distribution customer, whose various branches had sales in the range of 12% to 13% of total sales during the periods of 2020 to 2022 and was in the range of 7% to 19% of the Company’s accounts receivable balance over the last two years. All of this business is done on a purchase order basis for immediate resale commitments or stocking, and there are no long-term purchase commitments. In the event we were to lose an account, we would not expect any long-term reduction in our sales due to the broad end-user acceptance of our products. We would anticipate that in the event of a loss of any one or more distributors, that after an initial transition period, the sales of our products would resume at or near their historical levels. Furthermore, in the case of certain national distribution chains, which is the case regarding the Company’s largest customer noted above, and other distributors, it is possible that there would continue to be purchasing activity from one or more regional or branch distribution customers. We sell our products within North America, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, and we also sell our products internationally, primarily in Europe through our manufacturing facility located in Banbury, U.K. Our sales outside of North America were in the range of 5% to 7% of our total sales during the last three years, with most of the sales occurring in the U.K. and elsewhere in Europe. We do not have a material portion of our long-lived assets located outside of the U.S.
 
As mentioned previously, we sell our products primarily through independent outside sales organizations, including independent sales representatives, distributors, fabricating distributors, wholesalers, and OEMs. We have a limited internal sales function that sells our products to key accounts, including OEMs and distributors of bulk hose. We believe that within each geographic market in which the independent sales representative, distributor or wholesaler is located that our outside sales organizations are the first or second most successful outside sales organization for the particular product line within that geographic area.
 
TracPipe®
 
The Company has had the most success within the residential construction industry with its flexible gas piping products, TracPipe®, which was introduced in 1997, and its more robust counterpart TracPipe® CounterStrike®, which came to market in 2004. Partnered with the development of our AutoFlare® and AutoSnap® fittings and accessories, both have enjoyed wide acceptance due to their reliability and durability. Within the residential construction industry, the flexible gas piping products that we offer, and similar products offered by our competitors have sought to overcome the use of black iron pipe that has traditionally been used by the construction industry in the U.S. and Canada for the piping of fuel gases within a building. Prior to the introduction of the first CSST system in 1989, nearly all construction in the U.S. and Canada used traditional black iron pipe for gas piping. However, the advantages of CSST in areas subject to high incidence and likelihood of seismic events had been first demonstrated in Japan. In seismic testing, the CSST was shown to withstand the stresses on a piping system created by the shifting and movement of an earthquake better than rigid pipe. The advantages of CSST over the traditional black iron pipe also include lower overall installation costs because it can be installed in long uninterrupted lines within the building.

The flexibility of the tube allows it to be bent by hand without any tools when a change in direction in the line is required. In contrast, black iron pipe requires that each bend in the pipe have a separate fitting attached. This requires the installer to thread the ends of the black iron pipe, apply an adhesive to the threads, and then screw on the fitting, all of which is labor intensive and costly, including testing and rework if the work is not done properly. As a result of these advantages, the Company estimates that CSST now commands over one-half of the market for fuel gas piping in new and remodeled residential construction in the U.S., and the use of rigid iron pipe, and to a lesser degree copper tubing, accounts for the remainder of the market. The Company plans to continue its growth trend by demonstrating its advantages against other technologies, in both the residential and commercial markets, in both the U.S. and overseas in geographic areas that have access to natural gas distribution systems.
 
CounterStrike®
 
As previously mentioned, in 2004, the Company introduced a new brand of flexible gas piping sold under the registered trademark “CounterStrike®”. CounterStrike® is designed to be more resistant to damage from transient electrical arcing. In a lightning strike, the electrical energy of the lightning can energize all metal systems and components in a building. This electrical energy, in attempting to reach ground, may arc between metal systems that have different electrical resistance, and arcing can cause damage to the metal systems. In standard CSST systems, an electrical bond between the CSST and the building’s grounding electrode would address this issue, but lightning is an extremely powerful and unpredictable force. CounterStrike® CSST is designed to be electrically conductive and therefore disperse the energy of any electrical charge over the entire surface of the CounterStrike® line. In 2007, the Company introduced a new version of CounterStrike® CSST that was tested to be even more resistant to damage from electrical arcing than the original version, and substantially more effective than standard CSST products. As a result of its robust performance, the new version of CounterStrike® has been widely accepted in the market, and thus during 2011, the Company made the decision to sell exclusively CounterStrike® within the U.S. This move demonstrated the Company’s commitment to innovation and safety, and further enhanced its leadership in the marketplace.
 
DoubleTrac®
 
In 2008, the Company introduced its first double containment piping product – DoubleTrac®. DoubleTrac® double containment piping has earned stringent industry certifications for its ability to safely contain and convey liquid fuels. DoubleTrac® received certification from Underwriters Laboratory, the testing and approval agency, that our product is fully compliant with UL 971A, which is the product standard in the U.S. for metallic underground fuel piping, ULc S679 which is the product standard in Canada for metallic underground fuel piping, as well as approvals from other relevant state agencies that have more stringent testing procedures for the product. Additionally, DoubleTrac® is fully compliant with UL 1369, which is the bi-national USA and Canada standard for aboveground piping for flammable and combustible liquids. DoubleTrac® is one of a select few piping systems having listings and approvals for both belowground and aboveground piping systems. Similar to our flexible gas piping, DoubleTrac® provides advantages over older rigid pipe technologies. DoubleTrac® is made and can be installed in long continuous runs, eliminating the need for manually assembling rigid pipe junctions at the end of a pipe or at a turn in direction. In addition, DoubleTrac® has superior performance in terms of its ability to safely convey fuel from the storage tank to the dispenser, primarily because DoubleTrac® is essentially a zero permeation piping system, far exceeding the most stringent government regulations. Originally designed for applications involving automotive fueling stations running from the storage tank to the fuel dispenser, the ability of DoubleTrac® to handle a variety of installation challenges has broadened its applications to include refueling at marinas, fuel lines for back-up generators, and corrosive liquids at waste treatment plants. In short, in applications where double containment piping is required to handle potentially contaminating fluids or corrosive fluids, DoubleTrac® is engineered to handle those demanding applications.

DEF-Trac®
 
DEF-Trac®, a complementary product which is very similar to DoubleTrac®, was brought to the marketplace in 2011. DEF-Trac® piping is specifically engineered to handle the demanding requirements for diesel emissions fluid (DEF). Federal regulations require all diesel engines to use DEF to reduce the particulate contaminants from the diesel combustion process. However, DEF is highly corrosive and cannot be pre-mixed with diesel fuel. This requires that new diesel trucks and automobiles must have separate tanks built into the vehicle so that the diesel emissions fluid can be injected into the catalytic converter after the point of combustion. Similarly, a large portion of fueling stations carrying diesel fuel are now also selling DEF through a separate dispenser. In addition to being highly corrosive, DEF also has a high freezing temperature, requiring a heat trace in the piping in applications in northern areas of the U.S. DEF-Trac® flexible piping is uniquely suited to handle all of these challenges, as the stainless steel inner core is corrosion resistant, and DEF-Trac® also comes with options for heat trace that is extruded directly into the wall of the product. In summary, DEF-Trac® provides a complete solution to the demanding requirements of this unique application, as such, DEF-Trac® has been met with wide acceptance from the industry that was searching for a solution to the new environmental requirement. The advantageous market position of DEF-Trac® has leveraged the penetration of DoubleTrac® into the broader market for automotive fueling applications.
 
AutoSnap®
 
In September 2013, the Company announced that it would be releasing a newly developed fitting, AutoSnap®, as part of its flexible gas piping product line. After successfully completing all required testing by independent testing agencies, as well as extensive field trials across the U.S. by trained TracPipe® CounterStrike® installers, AutoSnap® was officially introduced to the market in January 2014 to wide acceptance. With its patent-pending design, the product simplified the installation process, and addressed installer preferences for both speed and ease of installation. The AutoSnap® fitting now commands a significant portion of the Company’s fittings demand.
 
MediTrac®
 
In 2019, the Company commercialized MediTrac®, corrugated medical tubing (“CMT”), following its 2018 launch with several beta sites. Developed for the healthcare industry, the product can be used in hospitals, ambulatory care centers, dental, physician and veterinary clinics, laboratories, and any facility that uses medical gases (oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc.). Made from a copper alloy with an exterior fire-retardant jacket, MediTrac® is made and sold in long continuous-length rolls. MediTrac®’s flexible nature and storage in rolls allows it to be transported to and installed in health care facilities much more easily and quickly than traditional medical grade rigid copper pipe, which comes in 20 foot long sections. MediTrac® is unrolled from a spool and installed in a medical facility in one long continuous length and is bent by hand when a change in direction is needed. The long lengths and ability to change direction with ease eliminates labor that would otherwise be needed to braze connections to straight sections of copper pipe or elbows or tees for changes in direction, while increasing installation efficiency and operational safety and minimizing downtime for healthcare facilities. Easy to assemble axial swaged brass fittings connect with all K, L and DWV medical tubing that is sized from ½” to 2” in diameter and provides a leak-tight seal using ordinary hand tools. The patent-pending fitting also prevents tampering or disassembly using a tamper-proof sleeve that is required by the Health Care Facilities Code (NFPA 99 – 2018 edition). Rated at 185 psig, MediTrac® can deliver the necessary volume of gas wherever it is needed across a facility. A recent case study comparing the installation of rigid copper pipe and MediTrac® showed that MediTrac® increases installation efficiency by a factor of five (i.e., a 500% increase in efficiency). By reducing the number of joints and brazed connections, MediTrac® also reduces possible contamination into the medical gas system along with the fire risk associated with brazing. MediTrac® is currently listed at UL 1365 and has an ASTM E84 rating of 25/50 and meets all 2018 requirements of the Health Care Facilities Code (NFPA 99 – 2018). MediTrac® also meets Canadian standard Z7396.1, Medical Gas Pipeline Systems.
 
In 2020, the MediTrac® product line experienced significant growth in use and acceptance in the marketplace resulting from its ability to be quickly and safely installed to meet the unprecedented crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous medical institutions and emergency medical centers used MediTrac® CMT to quickly install medical gas lines in tent hospitals or in converted facilities to handle the surging demand. For example, MediTrac® medical gas piping was installed in a City of New York temporary hospital located in Central Park and in the Cleveland Clinic for patients with COVID-19 infections and in need of supplemental oxygen treatments. On September 25, 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a waiver allowing the use of CMT in new and existing healthcare facilities based on the provisions in NFPA 99 – 2018, allowing MediTrac® to be installed in all facilities in the U.S.

Additional Market Applications
 
In addition to the flexible gas piping and other previously described markets, our flexible metal hose is used in a wide variety of other applications. Our involvement in these markets is important because just as the flexible gas piping applications have sprung from our expertise in manufacturing metal hose, other applications may also evolve from our participation in the industry. Flexible metal hose is used in a wide variety of industrial and processing applications where the characteristics of the flexible hose in terms of its flexibility, and its ability to absorb vibration and thermal expansion and contraction, have substantial benefits over rigid piping. For example, in certain pharmaceutical processing applications, the process of developing the specific pharmaceutical may require rapid freezing of various compounds through the use of liquefied gases, such as liquefied nitrogen, helium or hydrofluorocarbons. The use of flexible metal tubing is particularly appropriate in these types of applications. Flexible metal hose can accommodate the thermal expansion caused by the liquefied gases carried through the hose, and the total length of the hose will not significantly vary. In contrast, fixed or rigid metal pipe would expand and contract along its length as the liquid gases passed through it, causing stresses on the pipe junctions that would over time cause fatigue and failure. Alternatively, within certain industrial or commercial applications using steam, either as a heat source or in the industrial process itself, the pumps used to transfer the liquid or steam within the system are subject to varying degrees of vibration. Additionally, flexible metal hoses can also be used as connections between the pump and the intake of the fluids being transferred to eliminate the vibration effects of the pumps on the piping transfer system. All of these areas provide opportunities for the flexible metal hose arena, and thus the Company continues to participate in these markets, as it seeks new innovative solutions which will generate additional revenue streams for the future.
 
In each instance, whether the application is for CSST for fuel gases, flexible metal hose for handling specialty chemicals or gases, flexible double containment piping, unique industrial applications requiring the ability to withstand wide variations in temperature and vibration, or copper alloyed CMT for medical facilities, all of our success rests on our metal hose. Most of our flexible metal hoses range in diameter from 1/4” to 2” while certain applications require diameters of up to 16”. All of our smaller diameter pipe (2” inner diameter and smaller) are made by a proprietary process that is known as the rotary process. The proprietary process that we use to manufacture our annular hose is the result of a long-term development effort begun in 1995. Through continuous improvement over the years, we have developed and fine-tuned the process so that we can manufacture annular flexible metal hose on a high speed, continuous process. We believe that our own rotary process for manufacturing annular corrugated metal hose is the most cost efficient method in the industry, and that our rotary process provides us with a significant advantage in many of the industries in which we participate. As a result, we can provide our product on a demand basis. Over the years, the Company has had great success in achieving on-time delivery performance to the scheduled ship date. The quick inventory turnover reduces our costs for in-process inventory, and further contributes to our gross profit levels. We have also improved our productivity on a historical basis.
 
Markets and Competition
 
There are approximately 10 manufacturers of flexible metal hose in the U.S., and approximately that number in Europe and Asia. The U.S. manufacturers include Titeflex Corporation, Ward Manufacturing, Microflex Inc., Hose Master, Pennflex, and several smaller privately held companies. No one manufacturer, as a general rule, participates in more than two of the major market categories, automotive, aerospace, residential and commercial construction, and general industrial, with most concentrating on just one. We estimate that we are at or near the top position of the two major categories in which we participate regarding market share. In the flexible gas piping market, the U.S. market is currently concentrated in the residential housing market. Based on the reports issued by the national trade groups on housing construction, the level of acceptance of flexible gas piping in the construction market, and the average usage of flexible gas piping in a residential building, as well as through our sales position within that market, we can estimate with a high level of accuracy the size of the total gas piping market. In addition, the Company is a member of an industry trade group, which compiles and distributes sales statistics for its members relative to flexible gas piping. For other applications, industry trade groups collect and report on the size of the relevant market, and we can estimate our percentage of the relevant market based on our sales as compared to the market as a whole. The larger of our two markets, the construction industry, has seen a modest decrease in the number of residential housing starts in 2022, as compared to the previous year. As discussed elsewhere, black iron pipe or copper tubing was historically used by all builders of commercial and residential buildings until the advent of flexible gas piping and changes in the relevant building codes. Since that time, flexible gas piping has taken an increasing share of the total amount of fuel gas piping used in construction.

Due to the number of applications in which flexible metal hose may be used, and the number of companies engaged in the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose, the general industrial market is very fragmented, and we estimate that no one company has a predominant market share of the business over other competitors. In the market for double containment piping, we compete primarily against rigid pipe systems that are more costly to install than DoubleTrac® double containment piping. For medical tubing applications, the main competitor is medical grade (Type K or Type L) rigid copper pipe. MediTrac® is the only corrugated medical tubing in the U.S. that is approved to the stringent requirements of UL 1365. The general industrial markets within Europe are very mature and tend to offer opportunities that are interesting to us in niche markets or during periods in which a weak dollar increases the demand for our products on a competitive basis. Such has been the case for several years and has created new relationships for us. Currently, we are not heavily engaged in the manufacture of flexible metal hose for the aerospace or automotive markets, but we continue to review opportunities in all markets for our products to determine appropriate applications that will provide growth potential and high margins. In some cases, where the product offering is considered a commodity, price is the overriding competing factor. In other cases, a proprietary product offering, or superior performance will be the major factors with pricing being secondary, and in some cases, a non-factor. Most of our sales are to distributors and wholesalers, and our relationships with these customers are on an arms-length basis in that neither we nor the customers are so dependent on the other to yield any significant business advantage. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, under Significant Concentrations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional details. From our perspective, we can maintain a steady demand for our products due to broad acceptance of our products by end users, regardless of which distributor or wholesaler sells the product.
 
Resources and Raw Materials
 
We use various materials in the manufacture of our products, primarily stainless steel for our flexible metal hose and plastics for our jacketing material on TracPipe® CounterStrike® flexible gas piping and DoubleTrac® double containment piping, as well as a copper alloy for our MediTrac® CMT. We also purchase all of our proprietary fittings for use with the TracPipe® and CounterStrike® flexible gas piping, DoubleTrac® double containment piping, and MediTrac® CMT. Although we have multiple sources qualified for all of our major raw materials and components, we have historically used only one to three sources of supply for such raw materials and components. Our current orders for stainless steel and fittings are each placed with one or two suppliers. If any one of these sources of supply were interrupted for any reason, then we would have to devote additional time and expense to obtain the same volume of supply from our other qualified sources. This potential transition, if it were to occur, could affect our operations and financial results during the period of such transition. During 2022, the commodity price of nickel was significantly higher, and copper was lower compared to last year. Nickel is a prime material in stainless steel which the Company utilizes to manufacture CSST, and copper is a key component of the Company’s brass fittings and our MediTrac® CMT. Fortunately, the Company was able to maintain reasonably stable margins during 2022. This was mainly accomplished by implementing our own pricing actions to help offset the upward movements in the respective material markets. We believe that with our purchase commitments for stainless steel, polyethylene and for our proprietary fittings, we have adequate sources of supply for these raw materials and components. Like most other manufacturers, we had sporadic supply chain issues in 2022, but we believe our multiple suppliers have sufficient raw materials and capacity minimizing any potential disruption. We believe that the supply sufficiency of stainless steel will continue until there is a reduction in global capacity, such as mine closures, which would then cause constriction. Volatility in the commodities marketplace and competitive conditions in the sale of our products could potentially restrict us from passing along raw materials or component part price increases to our customers.
Business Seasonality
 
The demand for our flexible piping products that are related to construction activity including TracPipe®, Counterstrike®, DoubleTrac® and MediTrac®, may be affected by the construction industry’s demand, which generally tightens during the winter months of each year due to cold and inclement weather. Accordingly, sales are usually higher in the spring, summer, and fall.

Intellectual Property
 
We have a comprehensive portfolio of intellectual property, including approximately 123 patents issued in various countries around the world. During 2022, the Company allowed some patents to lapse in countries where warranted by market conditions, in particular, where the likelihood of entering the market is remote. Our active patents cover (a) pre-sleeved CSST for use in underground applications, (b) an electrically conductive jacket for flexible gas piping that we sell under the trademark CounterStrike®, (c) a tubing containment system for our DoubleTrac® double containment piping, and (d) fittings for use with our MediTrac® corrugated medical tubing. Our patent-pending AutoSnap® fitting is a prominently used product with flexible gas piping because it offers a metal-to-metal seal between the fitting and the tubing, and because of its robustness and ease of use. The metal-to-metal contact provides for a longer lasting and more reliable seal than fittings which use gaskets or sealing compounds that can deteriorate over time. In applications involving fuel gases in a building, the ability to maintain the seal and prevent the leaking of such gases over long periods of time is valued by our customers. In addition, the AutoSnap® fitting provides the installer with greater ease of use by preassembling all the securing elements inside the body of the fitting. We also have a patent for the composition of the polyethylene jacket used in the prior version of CounterStrike® flexible gas piping product, which has increased ability to dissipate electrical energy in the event of a nearby lightning strike. The tubing containment system of our DoubleTrac® double containment piping, which is also patented in the U.S. and in other countries, allows for the monitoring and collection of any liquids that may leak from the stainless steel containment layer. We have filed patent applications for the MediTrac® fittings to cover the unique requirements in the U.S. for fittings that permanently affix the fitting to the CMT system and provides a tamper-proof connection to the CMT system. Several patents covering the prior version of the Counterstrike® jacket will expire in 2024. We currently have several patent applications pending in the U.S. and internationally covering our AutoSnap® fittings and improvements to our CounterStrike® polyethylene jacket. Finally, and as mentioned above, our unique rotary process for manufacturing flexible metal hose has been developed over a number of years and constitutes a valuable trade secret.
