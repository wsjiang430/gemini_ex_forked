ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OUR BUSINESS

REPRO MED SYSTEMS, INC. d/b/a RMS Medical Products (“REPRO MED,” “RMS Medical Products,” “RMS”, the “Company” “our” or “we”), designs, manufactures and markets proprietary and innovative portable medical devices, primarily for the ambulatory infusion market in compliance with the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) quality and regulatory system and international standards for quality system management. Our development and marketing focus is primarily concentrated on our mechanical infusion products, the FREEDOM Infusion Systems (which we refer to as the “FREEDOM System” when used with one or more accessories), which include the FREEDOM60® Syringe Driver, the FreedomEdge® Syringe Driver, HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets™ and RMS Precision Flow Rate Tubing™. The Company incorporated in the State of New York in March 1980.
OUR MISSION

Our mission is to improve the quality of life of patients around the world through the development and delivery of high quality, innovative and easy to use therapeutic solutions.

We strive to be the best specialty infusion system partner providing a proprietary drug and fluid delivery system for home or alternate site settings where performance, reliability, ease of use and cost effectiveness are driving influencers. Our easy-to-use, lightweight and portable FREEDOM System allows the patient to continue with their daily activities while receiving infusion therapy. The patient experiences optimal therapy delivery using the innovative FREEDOM System with dynamic equilibrium (“DynEqTM”), HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets and RMS Precision Flow Rate Tubing.

OUR STRATEGY

In January 2019, the Board of Directors approved our strategic plan to become the preferred drug delivery partner for specific infusion therapies in select markets.

- 3 -

 The financial goals for our strategic plan through 2022 are:


• | $50 million net revenue run rate 
• | 70%+ gross margins, and 
• | 20%+ annual organic revenue growth 


We are committed to delivering simple, effective, drug delivery systems to the home health care environment. We believe our Freedom Infusion Systems using DynEqTM technology is superbly positioned for Immunoglobulin therapy and we plan to build on that platform. We plan to drive revenue by supporting the accelerating adoption of Hizentra®, Cuvitru® and other formulations for immunoglobulin therapy and participating in the migration of other therapeutics into the home health marketplace globally. We expect to leverage our specialty pharmacy customer base by bringing additional products and services to our channel.

OUR PRODUCTS

FREEDOM SYSTEM

The FREEDOM System comprises the FREEDOM60 Syringe Driver (60ml syringe compatible) and FreedomEdge Syringe Driver (30ml and 20ml syringe compatible), HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets and RMS Precision Flow Rate Tubing. The systems are portable, maintenance free and do not require batteries or electricity. The FREEDOM System operates at a lower pressure than an electrical pump and maintains a balance between what a patient’s subcutaneous tissues are able to absorb and what the system delivers, or what we refer to as “DynEq™”.

The FDA issued a 510(k) clearance for the RMS “Integrated Catch-Up Freedom Syringe Driver Infusion System,” which is our FREEDOM System, effective August 31, 2017, which includes the RMS Precision Flow Tubing and our HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets. The FREEDOM System is cleared by the FDA for a wide range of flow rates and certain medications for subcutaneous and intravenous indications, including specific clearance for leading immune globulins that include Hizentra® and Cuvitru® and a variety of antibiotics. The FDA clearance includes the following Caution Statement, “In order to achieve specific and repeatable flow rate performance with the FREEDOM Syringe Infusion Systems’ unique constant force mechanism, use only Freedom System accessories manufactured by RMS Medical Products …” and “For use with subcutaneous immune globulin products, use only RMS flow control devices and HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets, as use of generic products may result in unknown flow rates and additional site complications such as pain, swelling and redness.” 

Ambulatory infusion systems are most prevalent in the home care and alternate site markets. The use of the FREEDOM System for treatment of primary immune deficiencies through subcutaneous immune globulin (“SCIg”) administration continues to increase and remains the market leading delivery system in the U.S. for these infusions. There is an expanded indication for Hizentra® for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (“CIDP”) which is an acquired immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nervous system. It is expected that new SCIg drugs may enter the market. We believe the FREEDOM System is an ideal system for SCIg administration because:


• | the patient is able to self-administer in any location; 
• | the pump is easily configured for this application; 
• | it is the best value infusion system available in a heavily cost constrained market; and
• | it has demonstrated ultimate effectiveness and an impeccable safety profile. 


HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets are a critical element of the FREEDOM System, are available in 26 and 24 gauge sizes, and feature unique design elements specific to subcutaneous self-administration, including a back-cut needle designed for more comfort and less tissue damage with flexible wings to minimize patient discomfort. 

RMS Precision Flow Rate Tubing is designed for repeatable flow rates, and will not allow any free-flow, bolus or overdose of medication. The tubing regulates the flow rate and infusion time for various applications when used with the FREEDOM System. Each tubing set provides a different level of flow restriction and consistently delivers medication with low residual volume with the intent of minimizing drug waste.

We have available online our RMS Freedom Flow Rate Calculator, a tool designed to help providers determine which of the RMS Precision Flow Rate Tubing and HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets to use based on the medication being administered and desired flow rate/time of infusion.

 SALES AND DISTRIBUTION

The FREEDOM System is sold through both direct sales and medical device distributors, where the majority of our sales are generated. We sell most of our products through a small number of distributors, three in and two outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, these five distributors comprised approximately 75% of our gross revenues. One distributor in the U.S. provides approximately 58% of our gross revenues. Specialty pharmacy customers purchase FREEDOM System products through distributors for inventory management and one-stop shopping convenience. In the U.S., physician’s prescriptions for SCIg are filled by specialty pharmacies and home infusion providers who also provide patient care and training in the patient’s home or home infusion facility via a network of nurses. We continue our efforts to expand internationally with the majority of current international sales in the European market and the United Kingdom where our products are sold via distributors. We have two distributors outside the U.S., one in the United Kingdom and one in Finland, that accounted for approximately 11% of our gross revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

We provide education and training materials to clinicians, patients and patient advocates both in the field and online. Specialty pharmacies and home infusion providers are our primary call point.

MANUFACTURING AND RAW MATERIALS 

We perform product assembly, calibration, pre- and post-assembly quality control inspection and testing, and final packaging for all of our products at our Chester, NY facility.

Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of components for our products. All of the components that go into the manufacturing of our products and accessories are sourced from third-party suppliers, and some of these components are provided by a single supplier including subassemblies from Command Medical Products, Inc., molded plastic parts from a supplier in Taiwan and tubing from Natvar, a Tekni-Plex Co., Inc. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

We recognize the importance of innovation and renovation to our long-term success and are committed to research and new product development activities. Our product development team along with outside engineering resources is engaged in continuously improving existing product performance and researching new product opportunities to increase our pipeline. We spent $0.2 million on research and development for the year ending December 31, 2018 and $0.1 million for the year ending December 31, 2017. We intend to make additional investments in research and development over the next twelve months.
REGULATORY

Our medical devices and technologies, as well as our business activities, are subject to a complex set of regulations and rigorous enforcement, including by the U.S. Department of Justice, Health and Human Services-Office of the Inspector General, and numerous other federal, state, and non-U.S. governmental authorities. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products. 

Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under the FDA and other applicable non-U.S. government agency regulations. For instance, all medical devices marketed in the U.S. must be manufactured in accordance with the FDA’s quality system regulations. Accordingly, our facility and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 

The FDA has announced its intention to pursue comprehensive reforms to its current 510(k) clearance pathway, which is used for clearance of low- to moderate-risk devices that are substantially equivalent to a device already on the market, and to its post-market safety monitoring process. We cannot predict with any certainty how these reforms may impact our business. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

We are required to comply with federal, state, and local environmental laws; however, there is no significant effect of compliance on capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We do not use significant amounts of hazardous materials in the assembly of our products.

 COMPETITION AND THE MARKET 

Competition for the Freedom System includes electronic pumps, elastomeric pumps, and a mechanical pump. Safety, ease of use, familiarity, cost effectiveness, accuracy, pressure, etc. are driving influencers of pump selection. Electronic pumps deliver drugs at a programmed flow rate. They are expensive and require electricity or batteries, extensive training and maintenance and must be programmed by a qualified pharmacist or clinician. Elastomeric pumps are one-time-use balloon type devices used for infusion of drugs in intravenous (“IV”) applications. Pharmacies are required to fill them with drugs and deliver them to the patient. They are easy to use from the patient point of view but can be more costly and time consuming to fill, are temperature sensitive and have larger residual volumes than other delivery systems. Other mechanical pumps can be less expensive but can have larger residual volumes than ours.
EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2018, we had 75 full time employees and 1 part time employee.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We have filed and received U.S. and foreign protection for many of our products relating to infusion systems and related components. We currently have twelve pending applications and four issued with expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2031. In some cases where it was no longer deemed economically beneficial, we have allowed certain patent and/or trademark protections to lapse. In addition, the patent application process for both the U.S. and foreign countries is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual issues that differ from country to country. Consequently, there can be no assurance that patent applications relating to products or technology will result in patents being granted or that, if issued, the patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. There can be no assurance that we will have the financial resources necessary to enforce any patent rights we may hold. See ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS for details regarding our patent litigation.
