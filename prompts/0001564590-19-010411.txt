General
 Global Self Storage, Inc. (the “Company”) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that owns, operates, manages, acquires, develops and redevelops self storage properties (“stores” or “properties”) in the United States. Our stores are designed to offer affordable, easily accessible, and secure storage space for residential and commercial customers. The Company currently owns and operates, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, eleven stores located in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina.
 From September 1, 1983 to February 7, 1997, the Company was a diversified series of shares of Bull & Bear Incorporated, an open-end management investment company. On January 23, 1997, the Company (formerly known as Global Income Fund, Inc.) filed a Form N-8A Notification of Registration pursuant to Section 8(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), registering the Company as an investment company thereunder, and a Registration Statement on Form N-2 for closed-end investment companies. The Company commenced operations as a closed-end management investment company on February 7, 1997.
 On February 29, 2012, the Company’s stockholders approved a proposal to change the Company’s business from an investment company to an operating company that owns, operates, manages, acquires, develops, and redevelops professionally managed self storage properties and seeks to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal tax purposes (the “Business Proposal”).
 The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) order approving the Company’s application to deregister from the 1940 Act was granted on January 19, 2016. Accordingly, effective January 19, 2016 and in connection with the Business Proposal, the Company changed its name to Global Self Storage, Inc. from Self Storage Group, Inc., changed its SEC registration to an operating company reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), from an investment company under the 1940 Act, and listed its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “SELF”. The Company’s fiscal/taxable year ends December 31.
 The Company was incorporated on December 12, 1996 under the laws of the state of Maryland. The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). To the extent the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not generally be subject to U.S. federal i
ncome tax, with certain limited exceptions, on its taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders.
 Business Activities
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 28 total employees and owns, operates and manages, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, eleven stores located in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. As of December 31, 2018, these properties total 765,508 net leasable square feet and offer 5,624 storage units. In addition to traditional and climate-controlled units, many of the properties feature both covered and outside auto/RV/boat storage. The Company invests in stores by acquiring stores through its wholly owned subsidiaries and operates primarily in one segment: rental operations. 
 We continue to evaluate and enact a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to help enable us to maximize our stores’ financial performance and stockholder value. Our strategies in seeking to maximize our stores’ financial performance and stockholder value include, among others, the following:
  
• | continue to implement and refine our move-in rate management systems in seeking to maximize occupancies and thus revenue derived from our store portfolio;

• | continue to implement and refine our existing tenant revenue rate management systems in seeking to maximize revenue per leased square foot from our store portfolio;

• | continue to implement and refine our digital, drive-by, and referral marketing programs in seeking to attract more and higher quality (e.g. credit card paying) customers to our stores at a lower net cost; and

 Our stores are generally located in densely populated and high traffic areas near major roads and highways. All of our stores display prominent road signage and most feature LED marquee boards describing the store features and move-in rent specials. Our stores are generally located in areas with strict zoning laws and attentive planning boards which make it difficult for our competition to develop new properties near ours. As we evaluate potential stores, we seek stores in areas with these high barriers to entry.
 Most of our stores compete with other well-managed and well-located competitors and we are subject to general economic conditions, particularly those that affect the spending habits of consumers and moving trends. Because we operate in competitive markets, often where self storage consumers have multiple stores from which to choose, such competition has affected and is likely to continue to affect our store results. We experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels as well, with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity. We believe that our centralized information networks, national telephone and online reservation system, the brand name “Global Self Storage,” and our economies of scale help enable us to meet such challenges effectively. 
 In seeking to maximize the performance of our stores, we employ our proprietary revenue rate management systems which help us to analyze, adjust, and set our move-in and existing tenant rental rates on a real-time basis across our portfolio. Among other technologies, we employ internet data scraping of our local competitors’ move-in rental rates to help enable us to proactively respond and take advantage of changing market conditions across our portfolio of stores. Our operating results typically depend significantly on our ability to manage our storage units’ rental rates, to respond in a timely manner to prospective tenant inquiries, and to lease available storage units, and on the ability of our tenants to make required storage unit rental payments.
 We have registered the trademark and developed the brand “Global Self Storage.” We have developed a corporate logo and have incorporated it on all of our on-site signage, advertising and other marketing materials. This branding process has included the creation and development of the www.GlobalSelfStorage.us website, whereby prospective customers can rent a storage unit or learn about the features of any of our self storage properties in their various locations. We continue to develop the Global Self Storage internet presence through advertising and search engine optimization. We solicit tenant reviews for posting to the “Testimonials” section of our website and encourage others to view these reviews. We have found that a reliable source of new tenants is through referrals of current tenants. Existing self storage customers may also pay their storage unit rent online through www.GlobalSelfStorage.us.
 Attracting high quality, long-term tenants is a top priority for the Company and we strongly believe in tenant quality over tenant quantity. In our marketing efforts, we have seen success in our referral marketing program, through which our tenants may recommend Global Self Storage to their family, friends, and colleagues. We also believe our store managers’ attention to detail – maintaining security, cleanliness, and attentive customer service – is essential to attracting high quality tenants.
 Tenant leases at all of our stores are “month-to-month” leases. We seek to deliver at least 30 days’ written notice of any rental rate change. Lease rates at each store may be set monthly, semi-annually, annually, or at any other time on a case-by-case basis as determined in the discretion of management. Tenants may be assessed late, administrative, and/or other fees. To date, none of the Company’s stores have experienced any material delinquencies.
 Each of our stores features a rental and payment center kiosk available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, where prospective tenants can rent a unit and current tenants can pay their rent. All of our stores have on-site property managers who are committed to delivering the finest customer service. We utilize a customer call center to handle telephone inquiries from current and prospective tenants whenever our store managers are not available. They can respond to questions about our properties and storage features, and book reservations. We seek to deliver

convenience and high quality customer service to our tenants, as well as maintain clean and secure stores at all times.
 Please refer to Item 7 herein for further discussion of, among other things, competitive business conditions, the Company’s competitive position in the self storage industry, methods of competition, and the effect of existing or probable government regulations on the Company’s business. The SEC maintains an Internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Additional information about the Company, not contained in this form or made a part hereof, may be found at www.GlobalSelfStorage.us. 
 Our Acquisition Strategy
 In our store acquisition strategy, we will seek to continue to focus on secondary and tertiary cities in the Mid-West, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic parts of the country where we believe there is relatively less self storage space per capita available, generally resulting in greater demand for available self storage square feet; where new self storage development and permitting through the local planning and zoning boards is typically more difficult to secure thus creating barriers to entry for new self storage competition; and where local new supply through new development is generally less prevalent.
 We continue to review available acquisition opportunities with the awareness that, should interest rates increase, resulting store capitalization rates may also increase and store prices may begin to decrease. We will seek to continue to employ our strict acquisition underwriting standards and remain a disciplined buyer and only execute acquisitions where we believe that our management techniques and innovations can strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value. For future acquisitions, the Company may use various financing and capital raising alternatives including, but not limited to, debt and/or equity offerings, credit facilities, mortgage financing, and joint ventures with third parties.
 Our Financing Strategy
 Our financing strategy is to minimize the cost of our capital in order to maximize the returns generated for our stockholders. 
 On June 24, 2016, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries (“Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries”) entered into a loan agreement and certain other related agreements (collectively, the “Term Loan Agreement”) between the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries and Insurance Strategy Funding IV, LLC (the “Term Loan Lender”). Under the Term Loan Agreement, the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries borrowed from Term Loan Lender the principal amount of $20 million pursuant to a promissory note (the “Term Loan Promissory Note”). The Term Loan Promissory Note bears interest at a rate equal to 4.192% per annum and is due to mature on July 1, 2036. Pursuant to a security agreement (the “Term Loan Security Agreement”), the obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries. J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc. acted as Special Purpose Vehicle Agent of the Term Loan Lender. We entered into a non-recourse guaranty (the “Term Loan Guaranty” and together with the Term Loan Agreement, the Term Loan Promissory Note and the Term Loan Security Agreement, the “Term Loan Documents”) on June 24, 2016 to guarantee the payment to Term Loan Lender of certain obligations of the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries under the Term Loan Agreement. We have used some of the proceeds from the Term Loan Agreement to acquire four additional self storage properties.

On December 20, 2018, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries (“Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries”) entered into a revolving credit loan agreement (collectively, the “Credit Facility Loan Agreement”) between the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries and TCF National Bank (“Credit Facility Lender”). Under the Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries may borrow from the Credit Facility Lender in the principal amount of up to $10 million pursuant to a promissory note (the “Credit Facility Promissory Note”). The Credit Facility Promissory Note bears an interest rate equal to 3.00% over the One Month U.S. Dollar London Inter-Bank Offered Rate and is due to mature on December 20, 2021. The obligations under the Credit Facility Loan Agreement are secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries. We entered into a guaranty of payment on December 20, 2018 (the “Credit Facility Guaranty,” and together with the Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Credit Facility Promissory Note and related instruments, the “Credit Facility Loan Documents”) to guarantee the payment to Credit Facility Lender of certain obligations of the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries under the Credit Facility Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we have not withdrawn any proceeds available under the Credit Facility Loan Agreement. We currently intend to strategically withdraw proceeds available under the Credit Facility Loan Agreement to fund: (i) the acquisition of additional self storage properties, (ii) expansions at existing self storage properties in our portfolio, and/or (iii) joint ventures with third parties for the acquisition and expansion of self storage properties.
