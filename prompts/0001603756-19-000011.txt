Overview
We are a medical technology company that has developed and is commercializing an innovative and minimally invasive implantable neurostimulation system. SNM therapy is primarily used to treat patients with overactive bladder (“OAB”), including urinary urgency incontinence (“UUI”) and urinary urgency frequency (“UUF”), fecal incontinence (“FI”), and urinary retention (“UR”). 
Our proprietary r-SNM System delivers mild electrical pulses to the targeted sacral nerve in order to restore normal communication to and from the brain to reduce the symptoms of urinary and fecal dysfunction. We believe our proprietary r-SNM System offers significant advantages, including being the first and only rechargeable SNM system that is designed to last approximately 15 years and be 60% smaller than the InterStim II System (“InterStim II”), which is the only existing competitive SNM product and is marketed by Medtronic plc (“Medtronic”). We currently have marketing approvals in Europe, Canada, and Australia for OAB, FI, and UR. On December 3, 2018, we submitted a literature-based pre-market approval (“PMA”) application to the FDA for OAB and UR. This literature-based PMA was based on reasonable safety and effectiveness data from a literature review. In this PMA filing, we submitted existing literature reporting on InterStim II. In addition to the technical specifications, testing data and published literature, we included one-year follow-up data from our 51-patient RELAX-OAB European post-market clinical follow-up study to support the PMA, and subsequently provided the FDA with the clinical results on the first 60 patients to reach their six-month primary endpoint from our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study. Since the original PMA submission in December 2018, we have submitted various amendments to the PMA. These amendments include data in support of conditional full-body magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) labeling and complete three-month and six-month clinical data from the ARTISAN-SNM study. On March 1, 2019, we submitted a new literature-based PMA seeking approval for FI. This PMA is also based on an existing literature review of Interstim II. Typically, the PMA review process takes six to 18 months, with the duration depending on a variety of factors. We believe our r-SNM System has the potential to disrupt and grow the estimated $650 million global SNM market in 2018, which is currently controlled by Medtronic as a single participant.
We are continuing to develop a growing body of compelling clinical evidence that demonstrates the safety, effectiveness, and sustained benefits of our r-SNM System. We have in process two clinical studies relating to our r-SNM System; a European study, RELAX-OAB, and a U.S. pivotal study, ARTISAN-SNM. In our clinical work to date, we have implanted 180 patients, and in our investigator-initiated case series and through our commercial efforts in Europe and Canada, we have implanted approximately 100 additional patients. In June 2018, we completed the enrollment and implantation of 129 patients with UUI for our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study. These patients are being evaluated at 14 centers in the United States and five in Europe. We determined the study’s primary endpoint to be the percentage of patients that had a therapeutic response, defined as at least a 50% reduction in the number of UUI episodes per day on a three-day bladder diary at six months post-implant.
Key highlights of our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study are as follows:

• | The study has passed the six-month primary endpoint;


• | At six months, 116 of the 129 implanted patients, or 90%, were therapy responders, and the study has met all additional primary and secondary efficacy endpoints;


• | At six months, 93% of all implanted patients reported being “very” or “moderately” satisfied with the therapy;


• | No serious device-related adverse events have been reported; and


• | We submitted the complete six-month results of the study to the FDA as an amendment to our previously submitted literature-based PMA, and intend to follow patients out to two years.

Our European RELAX-OAB study that began in June 2016 evaluated 51 patients at seven sites in Europe that suffered from OAB subtypes UUI and/or UUF. The 12-month results were published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Neurourology and Urodynamics in January 2019.

All patients were directly implanted and evaluated to determine if they were test responders, which was defined as showing at least a 50% reduction in the number of average leaks or voids per day or a reduction to less than eight voids per day, in each case on a three-day bladder diary, within one month. We are following patients out to two years in this study and may follow patients out to five years at selected study sites.
Key highlights of our European RELAX-OAB study are as follows:

• | The study has completed one-year follow-ups and will complete two-year follow-ups in the second quarter of 2019;


• | Therapy responder rate at 12 months for the 43 patients who continued with study follow-up was 94% for test responders and 72% for all implanted patients; and


• | No serious device-related adverse events have been reported.

OAB and FI are dysfunctions, rather than diseases, with a complex group of symptoms that frequently overlap and may be caused by a diverse set of underlying conditions. These dysfunctions affect individuals of both sexes and all ages. OAB causes a sudden urge to urinate that may be difficult to stop, and could lead to the involuntary leakage of urine. In the United States and Europe, based on phone-based surveys as published in clinical literature, an estimated 87 million adults suffer from OAB. Additionally, we estimate that 40 million adults suffer from FI in the United States and Europe. The primary types of urinary and fecal dysfunction are as follows:

• | UUI is the sudden need to urinate accompanied by involuntary leakage of urine, regardless of frequency;


• | UUF is the sudden need to urinate an abnormal number of times, typically more than eight times per day;


• | UR is the inability to completely or partially empty the bladder; and


• | FI is the inability to control bowel function that could lead to involuntary leakage from the rectum.

Symptoms of urinary and fecal dysfunction can have debilitating impacts on social, occupational, and daily activities, which can lead to loss of self-confidence, depression, anxiety, and decreased sexual function and marital satisfaction. Comorbidities, which are generally more prevalent in patients with urinary and fecal dysfunction, may include falls and fractures, urinary tract infections, skin infections, vulvovaginitis, and cardiovascular and central nervous system pathologies. Left untreated, the effects of these dysfunctions impose a significant cost to society and place a high burden on healthcare systems.
We believe that SNM therapy is an effective treatment alternative for urinary and fecal dysfunction patients whose symptoms have not been adequately resolved by first and second line therapies. We believe that approximately two-thirds of patients in the United States with urinary and fecal dysfunction that are treated with SNM therapy have either UUI alone, or UUI in combination with FI or another subtype of OAB. We believe that approximately 85% of the SNM addressable market for OAB consists of female patients. Anatomical and physiological differences in the lower urinary tract of males and females may help to explain these variations.
First-line therapies for OAB include behavioral changes such as diet, exercise, timed voiding, pelvic floor exercises, and biofeedback, all of which often have limited effectiveness. Second-line therapies for OAB consist of drug therapy and medical management, and may be effective; however, the use of medication can cause undesirable side effects and the effectiveness may decrease over time with prolonged use. First- and second-line therapies comprise the largest segment of the treatment market for OAB. Patients who fail, or are contraindicated or refractory for, both first- and second-line therapies may be eligible for SNM as a third-line therapy.
SNM therapy has been commercially available in the United States for over 20 years and has been clinically proven to provide a safe, effective, reversible, and long-lasting solution. According to a study published in the Journal of Neurourology and Urodynamics, Siegel et al. in 2014, SNM therapy is the only third-line therapy for OAB that has objectively demonstrated superior efficacy to standard OAB medical therapy. Relative to the other third-line therapies such as onabotulinumtoxinA (“BOTOX”) injections and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (“PTNS”), we believe SNM therapy has therapeutic advantages that include better efficacy and patient compliance.
We believe that our r-SNM System offers similar therapeutic benefits and competitive advantages to the only currently available SNM technology, InterStim II. We believe that our r-SNM System is the first and only system for SNM therapy with a rechargeable implantable neurostimulator (“INS”), that is designed to last approximately 15 years. 
2

As a result, patients implanted with our r-SNM System do not need to undergo replacement surgery every three to five years, as is the case for patients implanted with InterStim II, potentially reducing the risks of surgery and associated infections. Our r-SNM System is designed to be full-body MRI scan conditionally safe, which avoids the risk and burden associated with the explant procedure that a patient may be subjected to, should the patient require an MRI scan for body part other than head, which is currently required for patients implanted with InterStim II. This full-body MRI scan conditionally safe feature may allow more patients to choose SNM therapy to treat their urinary and bowel dysfunction. In addition, we believe patients who have historically resisted SNM therapy because of the required multiple surgeries may be more inclined to be treated by our r-SNM System. Further, by reducing the number of replacement surgeries, physicians and facilities can utilize their resources more efficiently. Finally, our technology has the potential to significantly reduce overall costs to the healthcare system. In 2016, we commissioned a study that concluded that a rechargeable SNM system with a 15-year battery life could potentially reduce overall U.S. healthcare costs by up to $12 billion over a 15-year horizon.
We have designed and developed a proprietary method protected by patents, know-how, and trade secrets that enables us to combine ceramic and titanium for the INS enclosure of our r-SNM System. This method enables us to incorporate a significantly smaller battery and recharging coil into our INS, which enables us to provide a smaller sized implant that is half the weight of InterStim II, charges wirelessly and communicates wirelessly with the external components of our r-SNM System. In addition, we engineered the INS to deliver constant-current stimulation, automatically adapting stimulation output to the body’s physiological changes, which we expect will provide a more consistent and reliable therapy over time and reduce patient and physician management of the therapy. Our r-SNM System also includes an easy-to-use patient remote control. Finally, we designed and custom built a touchscreen clinician programmer that guides the implanting physician through electrode placement and stimulation programming. On February 22, 2019, we received CE Mark approval on our r-SNM System for 1.5T/3.0T MRI full-body conditional labeling. We also submitted to the FDA our testing data to support a full-body MRI labeling on February 12, 2019. We intend to continue to invest in research and development activities focused on improvements and enhancements to our r-SNM System. Our goals include extending the time between recharging sessions to once a month, introducing features that would enable us to connect our INS to an already implanted InterStim II lead, and expanding the suite of product solutions available for SNM therapy over time. 
Our r-SNM System consists of several components and accessories that provide a smoothly integrated, long-lasting, intuitive, and easy-to-use system. The miniaturized INS is a five cubic centimeter, rechargeable implantable stimulator designed to provide stimulation through a tined, four-electrode lead. SNM therapy generally consists of two phases, an evaluation period, also called the external trial period, which typically lasts a few days to a few weeks, and a permanent implant for those patients who experience a successful external trial period. The permanent implant procedure typically occurs in a hospital or an outpatient setting and includes implantation of the INS and, if a temporary lead was used for the external trial period, implantation of the permanent lead. The INS is inserted through a small incision into a pocket in the subcutaneous fat of the upper buttocks, and the lead body is tunneled to the INS pocket and connected to the INS. The INS is programmed by, and wirelessly communicates with, the clinician programmer, at a range of up to approximately three-feet. The patient has the ability to adjust stimulation intensity up or down or switch on or off, using a discrete, small and easy-to-use wireless remote control that communicates with the device at a range of up to approximately three-feet. The INS charges wirelessly for approximately one hour once every two weeks under normal use conditions.
The market for SNM therapy is large and growing. We estimate that the current global SNM market was approximately $650 million in 2018, which represents approximately 46,000 patient implants, including 10,000 patients undergoing replacement implants. We believe that nearly 90% of sales in this market are generated in the United States. 
We believe our initial target market consists of approximately four million adults in the United States and Europe who suffer from symptoms of either urinary or fecal dysfunction, who have already failed first and second line therapies and are readily treatable with, and eligible candidates for, SNM therapy. Further, we estimate that the global annual addressable SNM market is presently approximately one percent penetrated. We believe this represents a compelling opportunity for our r-SNM System to capture market share and further penetrate and grow the current U.S. market.
We intend to focus the significant majority of our sales and marketing efforts in the United States where reimbursement for SNM therapy is well established and covered by most U.S. insurers including Medicare. We are in 
3

the process of building a dedicated direct sales organization, which will initially target the estimated 1,000 physician specialists that represent a majority of the implant volume in the United States. We estimate that approximately 80% of U.S. implant volume is generated by these 1,000 physicians. We are in the process of hiring a specialty sales force of approximately 100 sales professionals, regional sales managers and clinical specialists in advance of the anticipated commercial launch of our r-SNM System in the United States. In addition, we plan to expand our current sales team into select international markets.
On October 1, 2013, we entered into a license agreement (the “License Agreement”), with the Alfred E. Mann Foundation for Scientific Research (“AMF”), pursuant to which AMF agreed to license to us certain patents and know-how (“AMF IP,”) relating to, in relevant part, an implantable pulse generator and related system components in development by AMF as of that date, in addition to any peripheral or auxiliary devices, including all components, that when assembled, comprise such device, excluding certain implantable pulse generators (the “AMF Licensed Products”).
Our Market
We believe our initial target market consists of approximately four million adults in the United States and Europe who suffer from symptoms of either urinary or fecal dysfunction, who have already failed first and second line therapies and are readily treatable with, and eligible candidates for, SNM therapy. Specifically, we believe this four million adult market consists of approximately three million adults with symptoms of urinary dysfunction and approximately one million adults with symptoms of fecal dysfunction within these regions. While we anticipate expanding into other geographic regions over time, such as Canada and Australia, we will initially focus on the United States and Europe due to larger overall market size and greater prevalence of urinary and fecal dysfunction.
The market for SNM therapy is large and growing. We believe that the global SNM market was approximately $650 million in 2018, which we believe is comprised of sales of SNM systems for the treatment of UUI, UUF, FI, and UR, and is growing at an approximate rate of 8% year-over-year. We believe this represents approximately 46,000 patient implants, including 10,000 patients undergoing replacement implants, with nearly 90% of sales in this market being generated in the United States and approximately 85% of sales revenue coming from new implant volume. Further, we estimate that the global annual addressable SNM market is presently approximately one percent penetrated. We estimate the global annual SNM market will continue to increase for the foreseeable future driven by increased awareness and education of SNM as a therapy alternative, greater expectations for quality of life, and improved patient attitudes toward receiving medical attention. In addition, market growth could accelerate due to more than one medical device company being focused on this market, new innovation for SNM therapy, and other potential products being introduced to physicians and patients. We believe that this represents a compelling opportunity for our r-SNM System to capture market share and further penetrate and grow the existing market.
Overview of Overactive Bladder
OAB causes a sudden urge to urinate that may be difficult to stop, and could lead to the involuntary leakage of urine. SNM therapy is a well-established third-line therapy for the treatment of certain patients’ symptoms of OAB, including subtypes UUF and UUI, and UR. Based on phone-based surveys of 5,204 people conducted from November 2000 to January 2001, a study published in 2003 by Stewart WF et al. concluded that of the approximately 244 million adult population in the United States at that time, approximately 40 million, or roughly 16.5%, exhibited symptoms of OAB. Additionally, based on telephone interviews of 19,165 people conducted from April 2005 to December 2005, a study published in 2005 by Milsom et al. concluded that of the estimated 391 million adult population in Europe at that time, approximately 47 million, or roughly 11.8%, exhibited symptoms of OAB.

In the United States and Europe, symptom-specific prevalence varies significantly by gender and age. The graphic below demonstrates OAB prevalence by gender in the United States and Europe.
Obesity and diabetes are frequent risk factors associated with OAB and we believe that the increase in this high-risk population is one of the factors that have driven continued growth in the prevalence of OAB. According to the Center for Disease Control (“CDC”), 11 states in 2000 had prevalence of obesity that exceeded 22% and this increased to 36 states that exceeded 26% by 2015. The CDC saw similar conclusions with the increase in diabetes prevalence, where in 2000, approximately half of the states had a prevalence of less than six percent, and by 2015, 27 states had exceeded nine percent.
While historically many people with symptoms of OAB have gone undiagnosed, we believe this is beginning to change. We believe that improved access to care, decreased social acceptance of compromised quality of life, and longer life expectancy may all contribute to individuals being more proactive about acknowledging symptoms of OAB and seeking medical attention. Previously, patients have avoided discussing their symptoms with medical professionals because of misperceptions such as OAB symptoms being a normal and accepted consequence of aging, and lack of availability of treatments, misguided fear of the currently available treatments, and general availability of self-management tools, such as pads. In addition, we believe programs such as the Patient Quality Reporting System (“PQRS”), which was introduced by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (“CMS,”) in 2013, have helped to improve the frequency of dialogue around OAB between physicians and their Medicare patients as it includes incentives and penalties for primary care physicians based on various quality of care metrics, one of which addresses treating UUI symptoms.
The urgency to urinate associated with OAB may be accompanied by a combination of several symptoms, including abnormally frequent urination, or frequency, that is typically defined as urinating eight or more times per day, involuntary leakage of urine, or incontinence, and the disruption of sleep to wake up and pass urine, or nocturia. The combination and severity of OAB symptoms varies from person to person. UUF is characterized by the sudden need to urinate eight or more times per day and, when this symptom is not accompanied by any other symptoms, does not include the involuntary leakage of urine. UUI is characterized by the sudden need to urinate accompanied by the involuntary loss of urine, regardless of frequency. Non-obstructive UR is the inability to empty the bladder without an obstruction, such as prostate enlargement or a stricture.
The prevalence of OAB between women and men is generally similar, however, it varies by subtype. Women are more likely to suffer from UUI than UUF, although the difference is not substantial. In contrast, men are much more likely to suffer from UUF than UUI. Incidence by age also varies between men and women, as women often develop UUI at much younger ages than men. UUI symptoms in women ranging in age from 40 to 65 years old are often associated with childbirth or menopause, while prostate enlargement, which is frequently associated with aging, is a leading cause of UUF symptoms in men. These age and gender differences are significant because they may impact who seeks treatment for symptoms of OAB. Individuals with UUI are more likely to seek treatment due to the impact of incontinence on quality of life, and younger individuals are less likely to dismiss symptoms of OAB as an expected 
5

and acceptable consequence of aging. As a result, women are more likely to seek treatment for symptoms of OAB than men.
Symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of OAB can develop due to a variety of underlying causes. When a patient consults a physician for the treatment of their symptoms related to OAB, the physician will first undertake a differential diagnosis in an attempt to determine the underlying cause of OAB. Underlying issues that can cause OAB include neurological diseases and injuries, obstructions, bladder abnormalities, and other issues.
If the physician is able to identify an underlying cause of OAB, the physician will then prescribe a care pathway to treat the underlying cause and alleviate the symptoms. When the physician is unable to identify an underlying cause of OAB symptoms, the patient is considered to have idiopathic OAB. We believe that these idiopathic patients are some of the best candidates for SNM therapy and where SNM therapy has been clinically proven to alleviate the symptoms associated with OAB.
In women, the largest group of OAB sufferers are idiopathic, accounting for nearly 50% of the female OAB population. The second largest category is women with mixed urinary incontinence (“MUI”), which means a patient has both stress urinary incontinence and UUI, accounting for approximately 40% of the female OAB population. While all women with idiopathic OAB can be treated with SNM therapy, based on clinical data, we estimate that approximately 40% of individuals with MUI will be candidates for SNM therapy based on the etiology of their symptoms. Accordingly, we believe that approximately 66% of women who suffer from OAB are treatable with SNM therapy.
In men, the primary causes of OAB symptoms are obstructive, in particular due to the benign enlargement of the prostate. Obstruction-related OAB accounts for over 60% of the male OAB population. Because obstruction-related OAB patients can be treated to address the underlying cause of the obstruction, these men are unlikely to be prescribed OAB medications and are generally not treatable with SNM therapy. Men who are actually diagnosed with idiopathic OAB only account for five percent of the overall population of male OAB sufferers. However, we believe that because of the prevalence of obstructive OAB in men, many men who actually suffer from idiopathic OAB (either alone or in conjunction with obstructive OAB) go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as having solely obstructive OAB. As a result, we believe that the population of men actually diagnosed with idiopathic OAB is comprised of a disproportionate number of men who have been prescribed and failed drugs for the treatment of idiopathic OAB, because there is another segment of men who suffer from idiopathic OAB that is not accounted for in this population. Accordingly, we estimate that approximately 10% of men who suffer from OAB are treatable with SNM therapy.
OAB is associated with a significant economic burden to the society. Direct medical and non-medical costs associated with OAB include the cost of diagnostics, pharmacological care, routine care, and OAB-related consequences such as urinary tract infections, skin infections, and depression. Further, indirect costs of OAB include caregiver wages and worker productivity losses resulting either from disability or absenteeism, as well as intangible costs including the quality-of-life impact and psychological burden. According to a study published in the American Journal of Managed Care in 2009, these OAB costs result in a total economic burden in the United States that is estimated to be between $24.9 billion and $36.5 billion.
Overview of Fecal Incontinence
FI is the inability to control bowel function, causing involuntary leakage from the rectum. Stimulation of the sacral nerves can reduce incontinence episodes, urgency, and frequency in people suffering from FI, and is an approved therapy for the treatment of FI in the United States and Europe. Moreover, a significant population of people suffering from FI also exhibit symptoms of OAB. SNM therapy can alleviate symptoms in patients suffering from either or both OAB and FI. We believe approximately 60% of people with FI exhibit idiopathic symptoms or experience FI as result of obstetric or surgical injury or other prior trauma, all of which can be treated with SNM therapy.
People with FI experience even greater degrees of embarrassment and decreased quality of life than people with OAB. The total FI population is estimated to be 40 million adults in the United States and Europe. We believe shifting expectations and attitudes toward medical attention suggest this addressable market has the potential to expand.
According to the American National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey program of 2005 through 2006, approximately 8.3% of the adult population in the United States exhibited symptoms of FI. Based on the estimate of the United States population in 2014 of approximately 221 million adults, approximately 18 million adults in the United States exhibited symptoms of FI. In this survey, FI prevalence was assessed as the occurrence of at least one incontinence 
6

episode during the past month. Weekly episodes were estimated to occur in 2.7% of the population, and daily episodes in 0.9%. In addition, according to The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom, of the approximately 391 million adult population in Europe in 2007, between 1.0% and 10.0% exhibited symptoms of FI. Based on this data, we have assumed that 5.0% of the adult population in Europe at that time, or approximately 20 million people, exhibited symptoms of FI.
Symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of FI can develop due to a variety of underlying causes. When a patient consults a physician for the treatment of their symptoms related to FI, the physician will first undertake a differential diagnosis in an attempt to determine the underlying cause of FI. Underlying issues that can cause FI include obstetric injury, inflammatory diseases, prior surgeries, and other issues.
If the physician is able to determine that FI is caused by a clear, underlying disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease, the physician will then prescribe a care pathway to treat the underlying disease and alleviate the symptoms. Patients with FI caused by past trauma, mainly from obstetric damage, represent the majority of candidates for treatment of FI with SNM therapy. Additionally, in the absence of an identified underlying cause of FI symptoms, the patient is considered to have idiopathic FI. These idiopathic patients, who make up 10% of women suffering from FI and 7% of men suffering from FI, are also ideal candidates for SNM therapy.
Path to Treatment
Overactive Bladder
In the United States, of the approximately 40 million adult patients with symptoms of OAB, we believe that approximately 15.9 million seek medical attention, with UUI patients more frequently consulting with a physician. Similarly, in Europe, of the approximately 47 million adult patients with symptoms of OAB, we believe that approximately 18.7 million seek medical attention. As a result, we believe that the OAB population in the United States and Europe who seek medical attention for OAB, which we refer to as the managed population in the graphic below, is approximately 34.6 million.
Of the approximately 15.9 million patients who seek medical attention in the United States for the treatment of symptoms of OAB, we believe that approximately 6.8 million are addressable with SNM therapy. Similarly, in Europe, of the approximately 18.7 million patients who seek medical attention for the treatment of symptoms of OAB, we believe that approximately 8.3 million are addressable with SNM therapy. These amounts are based on our estimates that approximately 66% of women who suffer from OAB have either idiopathic OAB or MUI treatable with SNM therapy, and 10% of men who suffer from OAB have idiopathic OAB. As a result, we believe that the addressable OAB population for SNM therapy is 15.1 million patients in the United States and Europe.
Before treating patients with a third-line therapy such as SNM, physicians are required to prescribe first- and second-line therapies. As discussed further below, first-line therapies include behavioral changes such as diet and exercise, and second-line therapies include drug therapy. In the United States, in order to secure reimbursement, physicians are required to prescribe, and the patient must fail, or be contraindicated and/or refractory for, up to two second-line drug therapies before beginning SNM therapy, although the course of treatment and its duration may vary patient-by-patient based on physician judgment.
Of the approximately 6.8 million patients who exhibit symptoms of OAB that are addressable with SNM therapy in the United States, we estimate that approximately 1.4 million are eligible candidates for SNM therapy. Similarly, of the approximately 8.3 million patients who exhibit symptoms of OAB that are addressable with SNM therapy in Europe, we estimate that approximately 1.6 million are eligible candidates for SNM therapy. These estimates are based on seven percent of these approximately 6.8 million patients who exhibit symptoms of OAB that are addressable with SNM therapy who are currently receiving second-line drug therapies but are not satisfied with the results and are seeking alternative treatment options, and 13% of these approximately 6.8 million patients who exhibit symptoms of OAB that are addressable with SNM therapy who have failed second-line drug therapies and are seeking alternative treatment options. As a result, we believe that the addressable population that is readily treatable with and eligible candidates for SNM therapy, which we refer to as addressable and refractory in the graphic below, is approximately three million patients in the United States and Europe.

The graphic below provides a summary of the calculation of the SNM addressable and refractory population from the overall population of OAB sufferers in the United States and Europe.
Fecal Incontinence
In the United States and Europe, based on published results from surveys of patients with FI, of the approximately 40 million adults with symptoms of FI, we believe that approximately five million people seek medical attention, which we refer to as the managed population in the graphic below.
Of the approximately five million people who seek medical attention in the United States and Europe for the treatment of symptoms of FI, we believe that approximately 1.7 million have failed or are dissatisfied with conservative treatment, which we refer to as the refractory population in the graphic below.
Of the approximately 1.7 million refractory population, we believe that approximately one million patients do not suffer from FI as a result of a condition that requires a different treatment path, such as neurological diseases, inflammatory disease and severe anatomical defects, and as such are readily treatable with and eligible candidates for, SNM therapy, which we refer to as addressable and refractory in the graphic below.

The graphic below provides a summary of the calculation of the SNM addressable and refractory population from the overall population of FI sufferers in the United States and Europe.
Current Treatments and Limitations
Patients with OAB follow a care pathway that transitions them, as necessary, through the progressive series of OAB treatment options. The care pathway directs physicians as to the progression of OAB treatments as follows:

• | First-line therapy: behavioral changes, including conservative treatment options such as diet, exercise, timed voiding, pelvic floor exercises, and biofeedback;


• | Second-line therapy: drug therapy, including two classes of OAB drugs, anti-muscarinics and beta-3 adrenergic agonists, with patients often trying multiple drugs; and


• | Third-line therapy: minimally invasive therapy consisting of SNM, BOTOX injections and PTNS.

First- and second-line therapies comprise the largest segment of the treatment market, and medication and other non-implantable treatments are better known to physicians and hospitals than SNM therapy. According to most U.S. insurance reimbursement programs, patients must try and fail at least two different medications before considering and being eligible for third-line therapies.
First-Line Therapies
First-line therapies represent conservative treatment options. Physicians may recommend that a patient make behavior modifications, such as drinking less fluid, training the bladder and/or pelvic muscles through Kegel exercises, among others. Such treatment options are limited in both duration and effectiveness.
Second-Line Therapies
Second-line therapies consist of medications, which comprise the largest segment of the OAB treatment market, estimated at $3.6 billion in 2017. Anticholinergics such as Oxybutynin, Vesicare, Detrol, Oxytrol, Enablex, and Sanctura are the most commonly prescribed medications. However, patients often do not fully comply with their drug prescriptions, due to perceived inefficacy and side effects. Mirabegron is the only available beta-3-adrenergic agonist that targets the bladder muscles and reduces bladder contractions and was approved in 2012 to treat OAB. Physicians may also prescribe Tricyclic antidepressants such as Duloxetine and Imipramine, which are not FDA approved to treat the symptoms of OAB, but have been shown to relax the muscles in the bladder and reduce urgency.

Anti-muscarinic drugs inhibit the activation of muscarinic receptors on the bladder muscle by acetylcholine. Dry mouth is the most bothersome adverse event associated with antimuscarinic drugs and often a reason for treatment discontinuation. Side effects also include blurred vision, photophobia, tachycardia, difficulty in urination, hyperthermia, glaucoma, and mental confusion in the elderly.
Beta3-adrenergic agonists are a relatively new drug for OAB that work by relaxing the bladder muscle in the wall of the bladder by stimulating the beta-3 receptors that are found on the surface of the muscle cells. This relaxation of the bladder muscle helps to increase the capacity of the bladder to hold urine. In turn, this reduces the need to pass urine. The most common adverse events observed with Mirabegron in clinical trials were hypertension, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infection.
Third-Line Therapies
Sacral Neuromodulation
Historically, SNM therapy has been the most common form of third-line therapy treatment for OAB. InterStim II, the only currently available SNM system, was approved to treat the symptoms of OAB by the FDA in 2005, and to treat the symptoms of FI by the FDA in 2011, and its predecessor, InterStim, was approved to treat the symptoms of OAB by the FDA in 1997 and 1999 for UUI and UUF, respectively. These systems have been implanted in over 300,000 patients worldwide, with a majority of all implants having taken place in the United States.
BOTOX Injections
BOTOX injections into the bladder muscle were approved for treatment of symptoms of OAB by the FDA in 2013. BOTOX is injected through a cystoscopic procedure in a clinician’s office or the outpatient surgery setting, and BOTOX treats OAB by blocking the signal from the bladder nerves to the bladder muscle. Key adverse events include recurrent urinary tract infections and self-catheterization due to inability to void. BOTOX injections are typically required every six to 12 months to maintain reduction of OAB symptoms. We believe the frequent need for injections and the adverse event profile are deterrents to initial and long-term preference for BOTOX injections, as evidenced by an approximately 60% rate of cessation of BOTOX injections at three years, according to a retrospective study by Mohee et al. 2012.
Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation
PTNS involves in-office placement of an acupuncture needle in a patient’s ankle to deliver electrical stimulation to the tibial nerve. Typically, patients undergo a 12-week trial period of weekly 60-minute PTNS sessions to evaluate whether the therapy provides significant symptom reduction. After this period, patients that continue with the therapy typically require monthly treatments to maintain symptom reduction. Adverse events of PTNS are minimal; however, lack of PTNS efficacy and lack of patient compliance result in PTNS generally providing less long-term effectiveness than SNM and BOTOX injection therapies.
Our Solution
We believe that our proprietary r-SNM System provides a minimally invasive, effective, and long-lasting solution for SNM therapy to treat patients with urinary and fecal dysfunction. We currently have marketing approvals in Europe, Canada, and Australia for all indications, and submitted a literature-based PMA application to the FDA for OAB and UR on December 3, 2018 and for FI on March 1, 2019.
Our r-SNM System includes two implantable components and various external components.
Implantable Components for Patient

• | Miniaturized rechargeable INS, which houses the electronics for the device. It is five cubic centimeters and is intended to provide two weeks of battery life between charges under normal use conditions.


• | Tined four-electrode lead, which delivers current-controlled stimulation to the targeted sacral nerve. The tines help anchor the lead in its desired position.

External Components for Patient

• | Wireless charging device, which allows transcutaneous charging of the INS. The charger uses an easy to understand combination of visual, audio and haptic indicators to provide information about the charging status.

10

Further, it has the ability to be held into position by an adhesive fixation device or a reusable and flexible belt, which significantly enhances patient mobility.

• | Wireless remote control that communicates with the device at a range of up to approximately three feet, which is a small and easy-to-use device that allows the patient to adjust stimulation intensity levels and turn on or off stimulation. The remote control includes a light-emitting diode light that indicates therapy intensity and the status of remaining battery life of the INS.

The implantable components of our r-SNM System deliver mild electrical pulses to the targeted sacral nerve, most frequently the S3 nerve, in order to correct the dysfunction by restoring normal communication to and from the brain. The sacral nerves, including the S3 nerve, are located in the pelvic area and are responsible for controlling urethral sphincters, the bladder and anal sphincter muscles. The image below illustrates the location of the two implantable components of our r-SNM System, the INS and the four-electrode lead:
Benefits of our r-SNM System
We believe that our innovative and proprietary r-SNM System offers competitive advantages to InterStim II, including the following important benefits:

• | Long-term solution. Our r-SNM System is designed to last approximately 15 years.


• | Material benefits to physicians and payors. We believe our r-SNM System has the potential to enable physicians and facilities to utilize their resources more efficiently and significantly reduce overall costs to the healthcare system.


• | Smaller and lighter implantable neurostimulator. Our INS is 60% smaller and half the weight of InterStim II.

11


• | Constant current. Our r-SNM System delivers constant-current stimulation, automatically adapting stimulation output to the body’s physical changes, which we expect will provide a more consistent and reliable therapy.


• | Improved patient experience. Our r-SNM System charges wirelessly and includes a discrete, small and easy-to-use remote control.


• | Simplified physician implantation and programming. Our touchscreen clinician programmer guides the implanting physician through electrode placement and stimulation programming, and enables physicians to access key data from the patient’s INS.


• | Safe full-body MRI scan. Our r-SNM System is designed to be full-body MRI scan safe. We believe that this feature will eliminate the risk and burden associated with the explant procedure that a patient may be subjected to when the patient needs an MRI scan for body part other than head, which is currently required for patients implanted with InterStim II. 

Overview of our External Trial System
Our external trial system (“ETS”) can be used during an evaluation period by a physician to determine if a patient is a good candidate for SNM therapy. This system includes a disposable external stimulation device, a disposable implantable lead, and a patient remote control. The external stimulation device is comprised of a temporary, non-rechargeable, current controlled pulse generator. The temporary implantable lead has a single electrode. Unlike InterStim II, the remote control used in the ETS is the same remote control used in our permanent r-SNM System. In addition, our ETS can be used for a bilateral percutaneous nerve evaluation trial or a tined lead evaluation trial. In July 2018, we received the CE Mark for our ETS.
Overview of our Physician Tools
We provide physicians with a clinician programmer and a surgical tool kit to assist them while implanting our r-SNM System. Our clinician programmer also allows physicians to connect to a patient’s INS, while the patient is in the physician’s care, to access key therapy data that is stored and maintained on the INS.
Clinician Programmer
We designed and custom built our touchscreen clinician programmer. The INS is programmed by, and wirelessly communicates with the clinician programmer. This programmer is designed to simplify and assist with electrode placement and stimulation programming experience for physicians. It has a series of touchscreens with a graphical user interface that provides information to the physician, such as measured data, test stimulation adjustments, and electrode configurations based on the utilization of proprietary algorithms. Further, it enables the clinician programmer to access any r-SNM INS data and its complete history. The clinician programmer records and stores all data from the INS and enables a physician to store and retrieve this data electronically.
Clinician Programmer
Surgical Tool Kit
The single-use surgical tool kit provides the physician with the tools necessary for the r-SNM System implant procedure. The tools provided are familiar for physicians experienced in SNM implants and follow the established surgical techniques for the implant.

Treatment with our r-SNM System
Patient Selection
SNM therapy is an approved therapy for patients with symptoms of urinary and fecal dysfunction. This therapy is not intended for patients with a mechanical obstruction such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, a tumor, or urethral stricture. Further, the therapy is not indicated for pregnant women, or pediatric use.
SNM therapy for fecal dysfunction is indicated for patients who are not candidates for more conservative treatments. The therapy is not indicated for pregnant women, or pediatric use.
Implantation
Before receiving our r-SNM System, a patient in the United States typically undergoes an external trial period.
External Trial Period
The short external trial procedure, which typically lasts approximately 30 minutes, is generally performed in the office or outpatient setting and typically involves a percutaneously placed lead, which a physician implants near the targeted sacral nerve using a needle, with the location confirmed utilizing fluoroscopy and intraoperative muscle responses evoked by test stimulation. The lead is then connected to a temporary, disposable external trial system which provides stimulation for the therapy. The trial period can last between a few days and several weeks after which the physician evaluates the effectiveness of SNM therapy through several measures, including urinary or fecal episodes and patient satisfaction. Approximately 60-90% of patients proceed from trial stimulation to permanent implant depending on the trial type and patient selection.
Permanent Implant
Patients who have undergone a successful external trial period are eligible for a permanent INS implant procedure. The permanent implant procedure typically occurs in an ambulatory surgical center or hospital outpatient setting, usually lasting under an hour, and includes implantation of the INS and, if a temporary lead was used for the trial, implantation of the permanent lead. The INS is inserted through a small incision into a pocket in the subcutaneous fat of the upper buttocks, and the lead body is tunneled to the INS pocket and connected to the INS.
Activation and Programming
Following the implant procedure or within a week thereafter, the patient has their stimulation programmed. Stimulation settings are adjusted to ensure they are comfortable to the patient. Reprogramming sessions may be necessary to achieve and maintain symptom reduction or to address discomfort. After initial programming, a patient has the ability to modify the therapy with the patient remote control.
Our Clinical Results and Studies
We are continuing to develop a growing body of compelling clinical evidence that demonstrates the safety, effectiveness, and sustained benefits of our r-SNM System. We have two clinical studies relating to our r-SNM System, a European study, RELAX-OAB, and a U.S. pivotal study, ARTISAN-SNM. We have implanted 51 patients in our RELAX-OAB study and 129 patients in our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study, with approximately 100 additional patients being treated in our investigator-initiated case series and commercially.
Our RELAX-OAB study that began in June 2016 evaluated 51 patients at seven sites in Europe that suffered from OAB subtypes UUI and/or UUF. A subset of the patients suffered from both UUI and UUF. Patients in the study were directly implanted without an external trial period. Within the first month, we evaluated the patients to determine if they were a test responder to the therapy, which we refer to collectively as test responders. Patients were considered test responders if they experienced (i) for patients suffering from UUI, at least a 50% reduction in the average number of leaks per day or (ii) for patients suffering from UUF (a) at least a 50% reduction in the average number of voids per day or (b) a reduction to less than eight voids per day, in each case based on a three-day bladder diary. For the subset of patients who suffered from both UUI and UUF, if a patient qualified as a test responder for either UUI or UUF, that patient was considered a test responder to the therapy. At one month, 71% of patients were test responders to the therapy. At three, six and 12 months, OAB response rate for the test responders was 91%, 94%, and 94%, respectively, and for all patients was 71%, 72% and 72%, respectively. Test responders also experienced clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life at 12 months. In addition, at 12 months, 84% of test responders were “very” or “moderately” satisfied 
13

with the therapy, and 100% of test responders found the duration of charging to be “very” or “moderately” acceptable. The 12-month results were published in the peer reviewed Journal of Neurourology and Urodynamics in January 2019. We are following patients out to two years in this study and may follow patients out to five years at selected study sites.
In June 2018, we completed the enrollment and implantation of 129 patients with UUI for our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study. These patients are being evaluated at 14 centers in the United States and five centers in Europe. Out of 129 patients, 119 were directly implanted without an external trial period. We have determined the study’s primary endpoint to be the percentage of implanted subjects that have a therapeutic response, defined as at least a 50% reduction in the number of urgency leaks per day on a three-day bladder diary at six months post-implant. At six months, the therapy response rate was 90% for all implanted patients, and 93% of all implanted patients were “very” or “moderately” satisfied with the therapy.
An investigator-initiated case series performed in Southampton, U.K. also supports the safety and effectiveness of our r-SNM System in treating patients with FI. In this case series, 13 consecutive patients with FI were offered the choice of treatment between our r-SNM System and InterStim II. Of these 13 patients, 10 patients chose our r-SNM System over InterStim II. As a primary reason for preferring our r-SNM System, seven patients cited the small size, and three patients cited the long life or rechargeability of our r-SNM System. Similar to our clinical studies, this patient cohort did not receive an external trial period prior to system implant. According to the investigator, of the 10 patients implanted with our r-SNM System, eight patients reported clinically significant relief of symptoms and improvements in quality of life at six months.
To date, we have observed no unanticipated adverse events (“AEs”), or serious device-related AEs, in any of our clinical studies or case series. Further, the safety and effectiveness of SNM therapy when compared to anticholinergic medications was also supported by the InSite study, a prospective, randomized, multi-center study, published on January 10, 2014 in the Journal of Neurourology and Urodynamics. This study was sponsored by Medtronic and began in 2007 and ended in 2016, after the last patient reached the five-year endpoint.
As part of the investigational device exemption (“IDE”) approval process for our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study, the FDA recommended that we make several modifications to the study design in order for the study to serve as the primary clinical support for a future marketing approval. In response, we have engaged with FDA regarding its recommendations. As a result, we incorporated a number of recommended study modifications. On October 19, 2018, the FDA approved our latest IDE supplement and removed certain of its prior study design recommendations. However, the FDA also continued to reiterate several of its recommended study modifications. 
To date we elected not to incorporate several of the recommended modifications based on what we believe are currently accepted urology practice guidelines and the design of previous OAB clinical studies accepted by FDA. We believe certain of these modifications would have resulted in a study design that increased study site and patient burdens, decreased the feasibility of enrollment or were not clearly supported by available peer-reviewed literature or currently accepted urology practice guidelines.
Although we have not modified the ARTISAN-SNM study design to address all of the considerations that the FDA has reiterated, based on the study results to date, we believe we will be able to provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of our r-SNM System to support its marketing approval. Nevertheless, it is possible that the FDA could disagree with our study design and require revisions to the study or data from an additional study before approving our PMA. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy—We currently depend entirely on the successful and timely regulatory approval from the FDA and commercialization of our r-SNM System, our only product. Our r-SNM System may not receive FDA regulatory approval or we may be significantly delayed in receiving regulatory approval. Even if we receive regulatory approval, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our r-SNM System.”
Sales and Marketing
We are in the process of hiring a specialty sales force of approximately 100 sales professionals, regional sales managers and clinical specialists in anticipation of the commercial launch of our r-SNM System in the United States. We intend to recruit, hire and train sales representatives with strong sales backgrounds and experience in SNM therapy and other neurostimulation applications, and with relationships with urologists and urogynecologists. We intend to focus the significant majority of our sales and marketing efforts in the United States where reimbursement for SNM therapy is well established and covered by most U.S. insurers, including Medicare. 
14

Through our specialized and dedicated direct sales organization, we plan to target the approximately 2,000 urologists, urogynecologists and colorectal surgeons who are trained and have experience performing SNM procedures. Specifically, we intend to target the estimated 1,000 physician specialists that represent a majority of the implant volume in the United States. We estimate that approximately 80% of the U.S. implant volume is generated by these 1,000 physicians.
In order to support our direct sales team, we intend to hire additional clinical support staff to expand our existing team of seven clinical support specialists. This clinical staff will be primarily responsible for attending implant procedures and assisting the implanting physician with programming the device. Based on our clinical experience to date, we believe that physicians experienced in SNM therapy require minimal training to start implanting our r-SNM System.
We also intend to promote broader awareness of SNM therapy for the treatment of OAB among patients and physicians, as well as awareness of the benefits and advantages of our r-SNM System. We plan to engage in awareness raising activities, including publication of scientific data in peer reviewed journals and education of physicians who are not familiar with or do not utilize SNM therapy. We may also engage in broad marketing initiatives in jurisdictions where we are permitted to do so.
While we have received regulatory approval in Europe, Canada, and Australia, our main commercial priority is the United States. In November 2018, we launched a limited commercial effort in Europe, where we currently have five dedicated sales representatives. We do expect to expend capital resources pursuing commercial operations in Europe, Canada and Australia, the amount and timing of which will depend on a variety of factors, including the size of the developed market for SNM therapy, burdens to entry and other region- and country-specific factors.
Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States, we expect to derive revenue from the sale of our r-SNM System to hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers, which typically bill various third-party payors, including Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other healthcare-related organizations. In addition, we expect that any portion of the costs and fees associated with our r-SNM System that are not covered by these third-party payors, such as deductibles or co-payments, will be billed directly to the patient by the provider. Third-party payors require physicians and hospitals to identify the product and service for which they are seeking reimbursement by using Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) codes, which are created and maintained by the American Medical Association (“AMA”). As SNM therapy has been widely used in patients for over 20 years in the United States, reimbursement codes and payments are well-established and the procedure is covered by Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans.
Physician reimbursement under Medicare is generally based on a defined fee schedule (the “Physician Fee Schedule”), through which payment amounts are determined by the relative value of the service rendered by the physician. Medicare generally provides reimbursement to hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers for SNM therapy under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system and the Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment System, respectively, which reimburse to the hospital or ambulatory surgical center, as applicable, a bundled amount generally intended to cover all facility costs related to procedures performed in the outpatient setting. The typical Medicare payment for facility and physician services for an SNM trial and full system implant ranges from approximately $21,600 to approximately $26,400, which covers the cost for the devices and the implantation procedures.
We believe that our r-SNM System and the associated procedures will be eligible for payment under the existing CPT codes typically used for SNM therapy, including CPT 64581 for transforaminal implantation of a lead near the sacral nerve and CPT 64590 for insertion or replacement of a peripheral or gastric neurostimulator, which includes a neurostimulator for SNM therapy. Reimbursement rates vary based on several factors, including but not limited to the payor, geographic location, the procedure performed, contract terms, the facility in which the procedure is performed and other factors.
Most large insurers have established coverage policies in place to cover SNM therapy. Certain commercial payors have a patient-by-patient prior authorization process that must be followed before they will provide reimbursement for SNM therapy. These processes typically involve the treating physician submitting a form to the payor that provides information about the past treatments provided to the patient that proved ineffective, and the physician’s recommendation that the patient be treated with SNM therapy. Although the prior authorization process 
15

can take several weeks, based on our industry knowledge, it generally results in positive coverage determination for these patients.
Outside the United States, reimbursement levels vary significantly by country and by region, particularly based on whether the country or region at issue maintains a single-payor system. SNM therapy is eligible for reimbursement in Canada, Australia and certain countries in Europe. Annual healthcare budgets generally determine the number of SNM systems that will be paid for by the payor in these single-payor system countries and regions. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government-sponsored and private health insurance plans, and combinations of both. Some countries or regions may require us to gather additional clinical data before granting coverage and reimbursement for our r-SNM System.
Research and Development
We intend to continue to invest in research and development activities focused on improvements and enhancements to our r-SNM System to improve patient outcomes and further expand patient access to our r-SNM therapy. Research and development expenses were approximately $19.4 million and $12.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our goals include extending the time between recharging sessions to once a month, introducing features that would enable us to connect our INS to an already implanted InterStim II lead, and expanding the suite of product solutions available for SNM therapy over time. Additionally, we intend to pursue regulatory approval for FI in the United States in the future.
Manufacturing and Supply
We currently outsource the manufacture of the implantable components of our r-SNM System. We plan to continue with an outsourced manufacturing arrangement for the foreseeable future. Our contract manufacturers are all recognized in their field for their competency to manufacture the respective portions of our r-SNM System and have quality systems established that meet FDA requirements. We believe the manufacturers we currently utilize have sufficient capacity to meet our launch requirements and are able to scale up their capacity relatively quickly with limited capital investment.
We employ a rigorous supplier assessment, qualification, and selection process targeted to suppliers that meet the requirements of the FDA and the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”), and quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures. Our quality assurance process monitors and maintains supplier performance through qualification and periodic supplier reviews and audits. We are required to maintain ISO 13485 certification for medical devices sold in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which requires, among other items, an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations.
We inspect, test, and assemble our r-SNM System under strict manufacturing processes supported by internal policies and procedures. We perform our own final quality control testing of each r-SNM System. However, we do not have complete control over all aspects of the manufacturing process of, and are dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations applicable to our r-SNM System.
Our suppliers are managed through our supplier management program that is focused on reducing supply chain risk. Key aspects of this program include managing component inventory at the supplier, contractual requirements for last time buy opportunities and second sourcing approaches for specific suppliers. Typically, our outside vendors produce the components to our specifications and in many instances to our designs. Our suppliers are audited periodically by our quality department to ensure conformity with the specifications, policies and procedures for our devices. In addition, we and our suppliers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by U.S. and international regulatory authorities to ensure compliance with quality regulations. We believe that, if necessary, alternative sources of supply would be available in a relatively short period of time and on commercially reasonable terms.
For our off-the-shelf components, we do not have long-term supply agreements with many of our third-party manufacturers, and we purchase certain components of our r-SNM System on a purchase order basis. We may be unable to establish any agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply of certain components of our r-SNM System. If our current third-party manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace those manufacturers. Although we believe that 
16

there are several potential alternative manufacturers who could manufacture these components, we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement. We believe our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet global market demand for our r-SNM System for the foreseeable future.
Competition
We believe our r-SNM System is designed to offer several needed improvements in the SNM market for patients, physicians, and payors. However, the medical technology industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants.
We consider our primary competition to be implantable SNM devices. InterStim II is currently the only implantable SNM device approved for commercial sale in the United States by the FDA. We also compete with other third-line treatments, such as BOTOX injections, a product sold by Allergan plc, PTNS, as well as more invasive surgical treatment options, and drugs for the treatment of OAB and FI. We face competition from major medical device companies worldwide, many of which have longer, more established operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, distribution, and other resources. Our overall competitive position is dependent upon a number of factors, including:

• | company, product and brand recognition;


• | history of product use and physician familiarity with products and treatments;


• | regulatory approvals and approved indications;


• | product safety, reliability and durability;


• | INS size, rechargeability and battery life;


• | full-body MRI scan safety;


• | quality and volume of clinical data;


• | effective marketing to and education of patients, physicians and hospitals;


• | product ease of use and patient comfort;


• | physician implantation and programming process;


• | sales force experience and market access;


• | product support and service;


• | technological innovation, product enhancements and speed of innovation;


• | pricing and revenue strategies;


• | procedure costs to patients and the overall healthcare system; and


• | dedicated practice development.

In addition to existing competitors, other larger and more established companies may acquire or in-license competitive products and could directly compete with us. These competitors may also try to compete with our r-SNM System on price both directly, through rebates and promotional programs to high volume physicians and coupons to patients, and indirectly, through attractive product bundling with complimentary products that offer convenience and an effectively lower price compared to the total price of purchasing each product separately. Larger competitors may also be able to offer greater customer loyalty benefits to encourage repeat use of their products and finance a sustained global advertising campaign to compete with commercialization efforts of our r-SNM System. Our competitors may seek to discredit our r-SNM System by challenging our short operating history or relatively limited number of scientific studies and publications. Additionally, certain of our competitors may challenge our intellectual property, may develop additional competing or superior technologies and processes and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could. Our technologies and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors. As more companies develop new intellectual property in our market, there is the possibility of a competitor 
17

acquiring patents or other rights that may limit our ability to update our technologies and products which may impact demand for our r-SNM System.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. 
We own numerous issued patents and pending patent applications that relate to our r-SNM System and we licensed several issued patents and patent applications from AMF in 2013 pursuant to the License Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we wholly owned 19 issued U.S. patents and 22 issued foreign patents, and 15 pending U.S. patent applications and 57 pending foreign patent applications. We also license from AMF 30 issued U.S. patents and four pending U.S. patent applications, as well as 41 issued foreign patents and 25 pending foreign patent applications. Issued patents owned or used by us will expire between 2023 and 2037.
There is no active patent litigation involving any of our patents or other intellectual property rights and we have not received any notices of patent infringement.
In addition, we own or have rights to trademarks that we use in connection with the operation of our business. We own or have rights to trademarks for our r-SNM System in the United States and select locations internationally.
We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation, and may in the future rely upon licensing opportunities, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with third party contract manufacturers, suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information that we own or license for use.
AMF License Agreement
On October 1, 2013, we entered into the License Agreement pursuant to which AMF granted us a royalty-bearing, sublicensable license to the AMF IP. The license to the AMF IP allows Axonics to make, have made, lease, offer to lease, use, sell, offer for sale, market, promote, advertise, import, research, develop and commercialize the AMF Licensed Products worldwide for the treatment of:

(i) | urinary and fecal dysfunction in humans through the application of electrical energy anywhere in or on the human body;


(ii) | chronic pain in humans through the application of electrical energy to the nervous system; and


(iii) | inflammatory conditions of the human body through the application of electrical energy to the vagus nerve,

excluding, in each case, any product or method that involves the placement of electrodes or the administration of electrical stimulation inside the cranial cavity or to the ocular nervous system or the auditory nervous system.
We have the right to expand the field of use for the AMF Licensed Products to modulation of digestive process and treatment of digestive conditions in humans through the application of electrical energy anywhere in or on the body, subject to the exclusions described above.
Generally, the license is non-transferable without the prior written consent of AMF, except to an affiliate of our company or in connection with the acquisition of our company (whether by merger, consolidation, sale or otherwise) or the part of our business to which the License Agreement relates, provided that the assignee agrees in writing to be bound to the terms of the License Agreement to which we are bound.
We granted to AMF a royalty-free, worldwide, sublicensable, perpetual, exclusive license to any patent rights controlled by us that arise out of our improvements to the inventions claimed in the AMF IP (the “Axonics Licensed IP”). This license granted by us to AMF explicitly excludes uses of the Axonics Licensed IP that are within the scope of the exclusive license of the AMF IP granted by AMF to us. Such license is irrevocable unless we terminate the License Agreement and AMF does not agree to pay us compensation for such license mutually agreed between us and AMF or determined by arbitration in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement. To date, we have not made any improvements to the inventions claimed in the AMF IP that constitute Axonics Licensed IP.
18

In addition, the License Agreement provides AMF with the option (the “AMF Option”), to license from us any intellectual property owned by us or otherwise in our control, that is related to electrical stimulation of human tissue, separate from the Axonics Licensed IP and AMF IP, on terms that are materially consistent with the terms upon which we license the AMF IP pursuant to the License Agreement, and subject to field of use restrictions that would be determined upon the exercise of the AMF Option. AMF has expressly declined in writing to exercise the AMF Option.
Under the License Agreement, for each calendar year beginning in 2018, we are obligated to pay AMF the greater of (i) 4% of all net revenue derived from the AMF Licensed Products, and (ii) a minimum annual royalty (the “Minimum Royalty”), payable quarterly. As of December 31, 2018, we have accrued $0.1 million toward the Minimum Royalty. The Minimum Royalty will automatically increase each year after 2018, subject to a maximum amount of $200,000 per year. We have 60 days to pay AMF the royalty amount due under the License Agreement, and if we fail to pay AMF within such 60-day period, AMF may, at its election, convert the exclusive license to a non-exclusive license or terminate the License Agreement.
The initial term of the License Agreement is from October 1, 2013 to October 1, 2033, and will automatically continue until all patents are no longer in force. Upon completion of the initial term, the license granted pursuant to the License Agreement will be fully paid-up and perpetual except that if we wish to continue to practice any of the patents licensed to us by AMF that remain in force after such initial term, then we will have to continue to pay a reduced royalty for so long as such patent remains in force.
Each party may terminate the License Agreement if the other party commits a material breach of any obligation under the License Agreement and such breach is not cured within 90 days following receipt of notice of such breach from the other party. AMF may terminate the License Agreement upon (i) notice to us in the event we challenge or assist any other person or entity in challenging the patentability, enforceability or validity of any of the AMF patents licensed to us under the License Agreement, subject to certain exceptions including challenges that we are not infringing any such AMF patent, and (ii) upon our filing of or the institution of bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership proceedings, or upon an assignment of a substantial portion of our assets for the benefit of creditors, and in the case of involuntary bankruptcy, in the event we consent to such bankruptcy and it is not dismissed within 90 days. Lastly, we may terminate the License Agreement in full for any reason effective upon 60 days written notice to AMF.
The License Agreement was amended twice in February 2014 in order to, among other things, include the field of the treatment of urinary and fecal dysfunction in humans through the application of electrical energy anywhere in or on the human body, within the scope of the licenses granted therein.
The agreement allows for AMF the right to use the AMF IP for non-commercial research, educational and scholarly purposes.

Government Regulation Applicable to Us
Our r-SNM System and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the United States, including the United States Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), as well as comparable authorities in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Our r-SNM System is subject to regulation as a medical device under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
In addition to U.S. regulations, we are subject to a variety of regulations in the EEA governing clinical studies and the commercial sales and distribution of our r-SNM System. Whether or not we have or are required to obtain FDA 
19

clearance or approval for a product, we will be required to obtain authorization before commencing clinical studies and to obtain marketing authorization or approval of our product under the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States before we can commence clinical studies or commercialize our product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or PMA approval.
Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Devices for which there is no predicate device and therefore are not eligible for 510(k) review but project a low-to-moderate risk may be eligible for the de novo review process.
We believe our r-SNM System is a Class III device that will require PMA approval in order to be lawfully marketed in the United States.
PMA Approval Pathway
Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective. PMA is typically supported by data from preclinical studies and human clinical studies. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a preapproval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality Systems Regulation (“QSR”).
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which may affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may require no clinical data or less extensive clinical data than the original PMA or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new supplement or PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
20

Clinical Studies
Clinical studies are typically required to support a PMA. All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical studies. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the applicant that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical study to proceed under a conditional approval.
In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical studies may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a cap on a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical study after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical studies. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
Post-market Regulation
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

• | establishment, registration and device listing with the FDA;


• | QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;


• | labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;


• | FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information;

21


• | the federal Physician Sunshine Act and various state and foreign laws on reporting remunerative relationships with health care providers;


• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (and similar state laws) prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not have to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;


• | the federal False Claims Act (and similar state laws) prohibiting, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing, or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing, an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government. The government may assert that items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;


• | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of a cleared device, or approval of a supplement for certain modifications to PMA devices;


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;


• | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;


• | complying with the new federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers (“UDI”), on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database (“GUDID”);


• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can under certain circumstances order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and


• | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.

We may be subject to similar foreign laws that may include applicable post-marketing requirements such as safety surveillance.
Our manufacturing processes will be required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which covers the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master record, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR or other applicable regulatory requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our r-SNM System.
The discovery of previously unknown problems with our r-SNM System, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its approval, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of our r-SNM System from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
22


• | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;


• | recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our r-SNM System or any future product candidates;


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;


• | refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;


• | refusal to permit the export or import of our r-SNM System or future product candidates; or


• | criminal prosecution.

Regulation of Medical Devices in the EEA
Medical devices, other than active implantable medical devices (“AIMDs”), placed on the market in the EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) must comply with the essential requirements set out in Annex I of the Directive 93/42/EEC (“Medical Devices Directive”).
Separately, active implantable medical devices are governed by Directive 90/385/EEC, also known as the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive (“AIMD Directive”). AIMDs are defined as medical devices that rely on a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that generated by the body, which are totally or partially introduced, either surgically or medically, into the human body and intended to remain after the procedure. We believe that our r-SNM System, or our internal product, qualifies as an AIMD and must therefore comply with the AIMD Directive, more specifically with the essential requirements it sets out at Annex I.
An overarching essential requirement proscribed under both the AIMD Directive and the Medical Devices Directive is that any device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured and packaged in a suitable manner.
In addition to the essential requirements set out under both the AIMD and Medical Devices Directives, the European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment, and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements, creating a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies the essential requirements.
Under the AIMD Directive, manufacturers must demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I by undergoing a conformity assessment procedure. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed to ensure and declare that the products in question comply with the standards set out in Annex I of the AIMD Directive. In addition, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body. Notified Bodies are separate entities that are authorized or licensed to perform such assessments by the governmental authorities of each EU Member State. Manufacturers of AIMDs must make an application to a Notified Body for an assessment of its technical dossiers and quality system. Alternatively, manufacturers can seek approval from the Notified Body that a representative sample of the products it has manufactured satisfies the requirements set out in the AIMD Directive and subsequently ensure and declare that all of its products conform to the standard of the approved sample. This is also known as “type approval.”
Similar requirements for conformity assessment procedures apply under the Medical Devices Directive, which vary according to the type of medical device and its classification. We believe that our external device is categorized as a Class IIa device under Annex IX of the Medical Devices Directive. As such, the conformity assessment procedure requirements for our external device are identical to those detailed above for our internal product under the AIMD Directive.
If satisfied that the AIMD or other medical device conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the Notified Body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity 
23

(see above). The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be legally placed on and traded within the market throughout the EEA. Once the product has been placed on the market in the EEA, the manufacturer must comply with requirements for reporting incidents and field safety corrective actions associated with the product.
In order to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for their AIMDs and other medical devices, manufacturers must conduct clinical investigations in accordance with the requirements of Annex X to the Medical Devices Directive and Annex 7 to the AIMD Directive, as well as standards (if any) which may be imposed by national authorities of EEA states in addition to those set out in Annex X to the Medical Devices Directive and Annex 7 to the AIMD Directive (the “Directives”). Clinical studies for medical devices usually require the approval of an ethics review board and approval by or notification to the national regulatory authorities. Both regulators and ethics committees also require the submission of serious adverse event reports during a study and may request a copy of the final study report.
On April 5, 2017, the European Parliament adopted the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which will repeal and replace both AIMD and Medical Devices Directives. The Medical Devices Regulation is directly applicable in the EEA. This is intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA countries. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.
The Medical Devices Regulation will only become applicable after the three-year transition period ends on May 26, 2020. Up until this date, conformity certificates can continue to be issued validly by Notifiable Bodies under the AIMD and Medical Devices Directives. Alternatively, during the three-year transition period, manufacturers can choose to conform with and have their products certified under the Medical Devices Regulations. Certificates of compliance issued pursuant to these Directives prior to May 26, 2020 will continue to be valid for up to a period of 4 years. However, after May 26, 2020, new products placed on the market may only be certified under the Medical Device Regulations regime. This new regime will, among other things:

• | strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;


• | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;


• | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;


• | set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and


• | strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.

United Kingdom’s Vote to Leave the EU
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of an agreement, two years after the United Kingdom provided its notice of withdrawal. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to EU markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from EU directives and regulations, the referendum could materially change the regulatory regime applicable to products approved and sold in the United Kingdom. It is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and EU countries, increased regulatory complexities, and economic and political uncertainty in the region. Because of the continued uncertainty about the effects, implementation, or potential repeal of Brexit, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of Brexit or related legislation on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
In addition, in event of Brexit, European and worldwide economic or market conditions will be affected, which could lead to instability in global financial markets. Brexit is likely to lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these 
24

effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Regulation of Medical Devices in Other Jurisdictions
We are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may sell our r-SNM System, including in the areas of:

• | design, development, manufacturing and testing;


• | product standards;


• | product safety;


• | product safety reporting;


• | marketing, sales and distribution;


• | packaging and storage requirements;


• | labeling requirements;


• | content and language of instructions for use;


• | clinical studies;


• | record keeping procedures;


• | advertising and promotion;


• | recalls and field corrective actions;


• | post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;


• | import and export restrictions;


• | tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements;


• | registration for reimbursement; and


• | necessity of testing performed in country by distributors for licensees.

The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse and Physician Payment Transparency Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, foreign, federal, and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including stock, stock options, and the compensation derived through ownership interests.
Recognizing that the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, the United States Department of Health and Human Services issued regulations in July 1991, which the Department has referred to as “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions which, if met in form and substance, will assure medical device manufacturers, healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Additional safe harbor provisions providing similar protections have been published intermittently since 1991. Although there are a 
25

number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Our arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other persons or entities who are in a position to refer may not fully meet the stringent criteria specified in the various safe harbors. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (described below).
Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $74,792 (in 2017) for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Liability under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may also arise because of the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business. While we are not aware of any such intentions or actions, we have only limited knowledge regarding the intentions or actions underlying those arrangements. Conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy one of these safe harbor provisions may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions, and in some cases, may apply more broadly to items or services covered by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers and self-pay patients.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The federal civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil federal civil False Claims Act.
In addition, private parties may initiate “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the federal civil False Claims Act in the name of the government and share in the proceeds of the lawsuit. Penalties for federal civil False Claim Act violations include fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and, most critically, may provide the basis for exclusion from the federally funded healthcare program. On May 20, 2009, the Fraud Enforcement Recovery Act of 2009 (“FERA”), was enacted, which modifies and clarifies certain provisions of the federal civil False Claims Act. In part, the FERA amends the federal civil False Claims Act such that penalties may now apply to any person, including an organization that does not contract directly with the government, who knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim paid in part by the federal government. The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the federal criminal False Claims Act. The criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious or fraudulent and, unlike the federal civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties ranging from $11,181 to $22,363 for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.
The Civil Monetary Penalty Act of 1981 imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence 
26

the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) also created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Many foreign countries have similar laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. Foreign laws and regulations may vary greatly from country to country. For example, the advertising and promotion of our r-SNM System and any future product candidates is subject to EU Directives concerning misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our r-SNM System and any future product candidates to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals. Also, many U.S. states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.
Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased foreign, federal, and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes annual reporting requirements on certain drug, biologics, medical supplies and device manufacturers for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians (including physician family members) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of $11,052 per failure up to an aggregate of $165,786 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.105 million per year for “knowing failures”). Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain foreign countries and U.S. states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities.
FCC Regulation
Because our r-SNM System includes a wireless radio frequency transmitter and receiver, it is subject to equipment authorization requirements in the United States. The FCC requires advance clearance of all radio frequency devices before they can be imported into, sold or marketed in the United States. These clearances ensure that the proposed products comply with FCC radio frequency emission and power level standards and will not cause interference.
We intend to submit an equipment certification application for non-experimental use to the FCC for our r-SNM System. Any modifications to our r-SNM System after FCC approval, if obtained, may require new or further FCC approval before we are permitted to import, market and sell a modified system, and it could take several months to obtain any necessary FCC approval. FCC approval has no impact on whether we will receive PMA approval.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
We are also subject to various federal, state and foreign laws that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers, such as HIPAA, as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), in the United States.
HIPAA established uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and requires certain entities, called covered entities, to comply with standards that include the privacy and security of protected health information (“PHI”). HIPAA also requires business associates, such as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that have access to PHI in connection with providing a service to or on behalf of a covered 
27

entity, of covered entities to enter into business associate agreements with the covered entity and to safeguard the covered entity’s PHI against improper use and disclosure.
The HIPAA privacy regulations cover the use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities as well as business associates, which are defined to include subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information on behalf of a business associate. They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her protected health information maintained by a covered entity, including the right to access or amend certain records containing protected health information, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of protected health information. The security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. HITECH, among other things, established certain health information security breach notification requirements. A covered entity must notify any individual whose protected health information is breached according to the specifications set forth in the breach notification rule. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal “floor” and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing protected health information or insofar as such state laws apply to personal information that is broader in scope than protected health information as defined under HIPAA.
HIPAA requires the notification of patients, and other compliance actions, in the event of a breach of unsecured PHI. If notification to patients of a breach is required, such notification must be provided without unreasonable delay and in no event later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. In addition, if the PHI of 500 or more individuals is improperly used or disclosed, we would be required to report the improper use or disclosure to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), which would post the violation on its website, and to the media. Failure to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security standards can result in civil monetary penalties up to $55,910 per violation, not to exceed $1.68 million per calendar year for non-compliance of an identical provision, and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment.
HIPAA authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents for violations. Courts are able to award damages, costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to file suit against us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care cases in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI. In addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities, such as us, and their business associates for compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security standards. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the civil monetary penalty paid by the violator.
In the EU, we may be subject to laws relating to our collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e. data relating to an identifiable living individual). We process personal data in relation to our operations. We process data of both our employees and our customers, including health and medical information. The data privacy regime in the EU includes the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”), regarding the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data, the E-Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC and national laws supporting aspects of the GDPR and implementing the E-Privacy Directive. Each EU Member State has transposed the requirements laid down by the E-Privacy Directive into its own national data privacy regime, while the GDPR permits EU Member States to implement local legislation to supplement the GDPR, and therefore the laws may differ by jurisdiction, sometimes significantly. We need to ensure compliance with the rules in each jurisdiction where we are established or are otherwise subject to local privacy laws.
The GDPR became applicable on May 25, 2018, replacing the previous data protection laws issued by each EU member state based on the Directive 95/46/EC. Unlike the Directive (which needed to be transposed at national level), the GDPR text is directly applicable in each EU Member State, resulting in a more uniform application of data privacy laws across the EU. Like the previous Directive, the GDPR requires that personal data may only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes based on legal bases for processing set out in the GDPR and local laws, and may only be processed in a manner consistent with those purposes. Personal data must also be adequate, relevant, not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is collected, be secure, not be transferred outside of the EEA unless certain steps are taken to ensure an adequate level of protection and must not be kept for longer than necessary for the purposes of collection. To the extent that we process, control or otherwise use special categories of personal data relating to living individuals (for example, patients’ health or medical information), more stringent rules apply, limiting the 
28

circumstances and the manner in which we are legally permitted to process that data and transfer that data outside of the EEA. In particular, in order to process such data, explicit consent to the processing (including any transfer) is usually required from the data subject (being the person to whom the personal data relates). The GDPR additionally imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and policies. It requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form) how their personal information is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of information, increases requirements pertaining to pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. Fines for non-compliance with the GDPR are significant—€20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. The GDPR provides that EU member states may introduce further conditions, including limitations, to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to collect, use and share personal data, or could cause our compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an adverse impact on our business.
We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to applicable law.
We depend on a number of third parties in relation to our provision of our services, a number of which process personal data on our behalf. With each such provider we enter into contractual arrangements to ensure that they only process personal data according to our instructions, and that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place, and that they comply with the other contractual requirements for third party data processors set out in the GDPR. Where we transfer personal data outside the EEA, we do so in compliance with the relevant data export requirements. We take our data protection obligations seriously, as any improper disclosure, particularly with regard to our customers’ sensitive personal data, could negatively impact our business and/or our reputation.
Healthcare Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our r-SNM System or any future product candidates profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our r-SNM System or future product candidates. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our r-SNM System or future product candidates.
The implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the United States, for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, a 2.3% federal excise tax, with limited exceptions, on any entity that manufactures or imports Class I, II and III medical devices offered for sale in the United States that began on January 1, 2013. Through a series of legislative amendments, the tax was suspended for 2016 through 2019. Absent further legislative action, the device excise tax will be reinstated on medical device sales starting January 1, 2020. The Affordable Care Act also provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act has expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. We do not yet know the full impact that the Affordable Care Act will have on our business. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect additional challenges and amendments in the future. Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of two percent per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative 
29

amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our r-SNM System or future product candidates or additional pricing pressure.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Laws
Our operations in the United States are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). We are required to comply with the FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of “off books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. We also are subject to similar anticorruption legislation implemented in Europe under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.
