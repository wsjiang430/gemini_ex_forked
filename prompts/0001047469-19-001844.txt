     Item 1.    Business. 
     DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUST 
        The Trust, created under the laws of the State of Texas, maintains its offices at the office of the Trustee, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., (the "Trustee"), 601 Travis Street, Floor 16, Houston, Texas 77002. The telephone number of the Trust is 713-483-6020. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., is the successor Trustee from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which is the successor by mergers to the originally named Trustee, Texas Commerce Bank National Association. The Trust has no employees. Administrative functions of the Trust are performed by the Trustee. The Trustee maintains a website for the Trust that makes available, free of charge, filings by the Trust with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and other information. Any reports filed with the SEC are accessible free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The Trust's website is http://mtr.investorhq.businesswire.com/. 
         Trust Corpus Description.    The Mesa Royalty Trust (the "Trust") was created on November 1, 1979, and is now governed by the Mesa Royalty Trust Indenture (as amended, the "Trust Indenture"). Through a series of conveyances, assignments, and acquisitions, the Trust currently owns an overriding royalty interest (the "Royalty") equal to 11.44% of 90% of the Net Proceeds (as defined in the Conveyance and described below) attributable to the specified interest in certain producing oil and gas properties located in the:


 Hugoton field of Kansas (the "Hugoton Royalty Properties"); 
 San Juan Basin field of New Mexico (the "San Juan BasinNew Mexico Properties"); and 
 San Juan Basin field of Colorado (the "San Juan BasinColorado Properties", and together with the "San Juan BasinNew
Mexico Properties, the "San Juan Basin Royalty Properties", and together with the Hugoton Royalty Properties, the "Royalty Properties"). 

         Trust Corpus Conveyance History.    On November 1, 1979, Mesa Petroleum Co., predecessor to Mesa Limited Partnership ("MLP"), which was the predecessor to MESA Inc., conveyed to the Trust the Royalty equal to 90% of the Net Proceeds (as defined in the Conveyance and described below) attributable to the specified interests in properties conveyed by the assignor on that date (the "Subject Interests"). The Subject Interests consisted of interests in the Royalty Properties described above. The Royalty is evidenced by counterparts of an Overriding Royalty Conveyance, dated as of November 1, 1979 (the "Conveyance"). In 1985, the Trust Indenture was amended and the Trust conveyed to an affiliate of Mesa Petroleum Co. 88.5571% of the original Royalty (such transfer, the "1985 Assignment"). The effect of the 1985 Assignment was an overall reduction of approximately 88.56% in the size of the Trust. As a result, the Trust is now entitled to receive 11.44% of 90% of the Net Proceeds attributable to each month. 
  Hugoton Royalty Properties.    Until August 7, 1997, MESA Inc. operated the Hugoton Royalty Properties through Mesa Operating Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of MESA Inc. On August 7, 1997, MESA Inc. merged with and into Pioneer Natural Resources Company ("Pioneer"), formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of MESA Inc., and Parker & Parsley Petroleum Company merged with and into Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc. (successor to Mesa Operating Co.), a wholly owned subsidiary of Pioneer ("PNR") (collectively, the mergers are referred to herein as the "Merger"). Subsequent to the Merger, the Hugoton Royalty Properties were operated by PNR until December 31, 2014, at which point Linn Energy Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of Linn Energy, LLC ("Old Linn") took over as operator. Pursuant to the bankruptcy proceedings and court-approved plans of reorganization involving Old Linn, which are described in detail below, Linn Energy, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Linn") 
 1

   became the operator of the Hugoton Royalty Properties on February 28, 2017. On April 18, 2018, Linn announced its Board of Directors' decision to separate Linn into two stand-alone public companies. On August 7, 2018 Linn completed the spin-off of Riviera Resources, Inc. ("Riviera") through the pro rata distribution of all of the shares of Riviera's outstanding common stock to Linn's stockholders. In connection with such distribution, Linn ceased to be the operator of the Hugoton Royalty Properties, and since August 7, 2018, Riviera has operated the Hugoton Royalty Properties. 
         San Juan BasinColorado Properties.    On April 30, 1991, MLP sold to Conoco, Inc. ("ConocoPhillips") its interests in the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties (the "San Juan Basin Sale"). The Trust's interest in the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties was conveyed from PNR's working interest in 31,328 net producing acres in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado. ConocoPhillips sold the portion of its interests in the San Juan BasinColorado Properties to MarkWest Energy Partners, Ltd. (effective January 1, 1993) and Red Willow Production Company ("Red Willow") (effective April 1, 1992). On October 26, 1994, MarkWest Energy Partners, Ltd. sold substantially all of its interest in the San Juan BasinColorado Properties to BP Amoco Company ("BP"), a subsidiary of BP p.l.c. BP and Red Willow currently operate the San Juan BasinColorado Properties. 
  San Juan BasinNew Mexico Properties.    Starting from the date of the San Juan Basin Sale and ending on July 31, 2017, ConocoPhillips operated substantially all of the San Juan BasinNew Mexico Properties, except an immaterial number of properties assigned to XTO Energy, Inc. ("XTO") effective January 1, 2005. On July 31, 2017, ConocoPhillips sold its San Juan Basin assets to Hilcorp San Juan LP ("Hilcorp"), an affiliate of Hilcorp Energy Company. On March 29, 2018, XTO sold to Hilcorp an immaterial number of properties, which comprise certain portions of the San Juan BasinNew Mexico Properties. Hilcorp currently operates all of the San Juan BasinNew Mexico Properties. 
         Following Hilcorp's acquisition of ConocoPhillips' and XTO's interests in the San JuanNew Mexico Properties, Hilcorp has made an estimated payment of Net Proceeds to the Trust each month consistent with the monthly amounts previously paid by ConocoPhillips and XTO. As a result of the payment of estimated Net Proceeds, Hilcorp has informed the Trust that it will reconcile estimated versus actual revenue figures once it finalizes installation of its revenue decks, although Hilcorp has not indicated when such reconciliation may occur. At the time that Hilcorp reconciles estimated versus actual revenue numbers, such estimations and reconciliations by Hilcorp will be added to or subtracted from future Net Proceeds paid to the Trust in accordance with the Trust's basis of financial presentation. Pursuant to the Trust Indenture, the Trust is not required to pay to Hilcorp any amounts that could be owed if the estimated revenue exceeded actual revenue figures in past periods, plus any additional required costs. However, Hilcorp may recover such amounts by withholding a portion or all of Net Proceeds that would otherwise be payable to the Trust in subsequent periods. This could result in a decrease in Net Proceeds paid to the Trust and could result in a future material reduction in distributions to the Trust's unitholders. Net Proceeds from the San Juan BasinNew Mexico Properties for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $1,165,797 and $1,085,082, respectively, which revenue accounted for approximately 50% and 36%, respectively, of the total Royalty income realized by the Trust. 
         As used in this report, Riviera refers to the current operator of the Hugoton Royalty Properties, Hilcorp refers to the current operator of the San Juan BasinNew Mexico Properties, and BP and Red Willow refers to the current co-operators of certain tracts of land included in the San Juan BasinColorado Properties, unless otherwise indicated. Riviera, BP, Red Willow and Hilcorp are each individually referred to herein as "Working Interest Owner" or collectively as the "Working Interest Owners." 
         The Royalty Properties are required to be operated by the Working Interest Owners in accordance with reasonable and prudent business judgment and good oil and gas field practices. Each Working 
 2

   Interest Owner has the right to abandon any well or lease if, in its opinion, such well or lease ceases to produce or is not capable of producing oil, gas or other minerals in commercial quantities. Each Working Interest Owner markets the production on terms deemed by it to be the best reasonably obtainable in the circumstances. See "Contracts". The Trustee has no power or authority to exercise any control over the operation of the Royalty Properties or the marketing of production therefrom. 
  Trustee and Terms of Trust Indenture.    Effective October 2, 2006, the Trustee succeeded JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Trustee of the Trust. The Trust is a passive entity whose purposes are limited to: (1) converting the Royalty to cash, either by retaining it and collecting the proceeds of production (until production has ceased or the Royalty is otherwise terminated) or by selling or otherwise disposing of the Royalty and (2) distributing such cash, net of amounts for payments of liabilities to the Trust, to the unitholders. The Trust has no sources of liquidity or capital resources other than the revenues, if any, attributable to the Royalty and interest on cash held by the Trustee as a reserve for liabilities or for distribution. The terms of the Trust Indenture provide, among other things, that: 
 
        (a)   the
Trust cannot engage in any business or investment activity or purchase any assets; 
        (b)   the
Royalty can be sold in part or in total for cash upon approval by the unitholders; 
        (c)   the
Trustee can establish cash reserves and borrow funds to pay liabilities of the Trust and can pledge assets of the Trust to secure payment of the borrowings; 
        (d)   the
Trustee will make cash distributions to the unitholders in January, April, July and October each year as discussed more fully in Note 2 of the Notes to
Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K; 
        (e)   the
Trust will terminate upon the first to occur of the following events: (i) at such time as the Trust's royalty income for two successive years is less than
$250,000 per year or (ii) a vote by the unitholders in favor of termination. Upon termination of the Trust, the Trustee will sell for cash all the assets held in the Trust estate and make a
final distribution to unitholders of any funds remaining after all Trust liabilities have been satisfied; and 
        (f)    Riviera,
Hilcorp and BP will reimburse the Trust for 59.34%, 27.45% and 1.77%, respectively, for general and administrative expenses of the Trust. 

  Linn Energy, LLC Reorganization.    On May 11, 2016, Old Linn, LinnCo, LLC ("LinnCo"), an affiliate of Old Linn, and certain of Old Linn's direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively with Old Linn and LinnCo, the "Debtors"), filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the "Court"). The Debtors' Chapter 11 cases were administered jointly under the caption In re Linn Energy, LLC, et al., Case No. 16 60040. 
         On January 27, 2017, the Court entered the Order Confirming (I) Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Linn Energy, LLC and its Debtor Affiliates Other Than Linn Acquisition Company, LLC and Berry Petroleum Company, LLC and (II) Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Linn Acquisition Company, LLC and Berry Petroleum Company, LLC, which approved and confirmed the Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Linn Energy, LLC and Its Debtor Affiliates Other Than Linn Acquisition Company, LLC and Berry Petroleum Company, LLC (the "Plan"). The Plan became effective on February 28, 2017 (the "Effective Date"). 
         Pursuant to the Plan, on the Effective Date, all assets of Old Linn (other than equity interests in Linn Acquisition Company, LLC and Berry Petroleum Company, LLC) were conveyed to Linn, and LinnCo, LLC and Linn Energy, LLC were wound down and liquidated. Subsequent to the effectiveness of the Plan, Linn Energy, Inc. became the reorganized successor to Old Linn. Under the Plan Supplement, as amended, filed with the Court, the Debtors assumed all executory contracts and unexpired leases with the Trust and Mesa Operating Limited Partnership as the counterparty. 
 3

   Furthermore, pursuant to the Plan, the royalty interests in the Hugoton Royalty Properties owned by the Trust shall be preserved and remain in full force and effect in accordance with the terms of the granting instruments or other governing documents. On April 18, 2018, Linn announced its Board of Directors' decision to separate Linn into two stand-alone public companies. On August 7, 2018 Linn completed the spin-off of Riviera through the pro rata distribution of all of the shares of Riviera's outstanding common stock to Linn's stockholders. In connection with such distribution, Linn ceased to be the operator of the Hugoton Royalty Properties, and since August 7, 2018, Riviera has operated the Hugoton Royalty Properties. 
  Discussion of Net Proceeds.    The Conveyance provides for a monthly computation of Net Proceeds. Net Proceeds is defined in the Conveyance as the "Gross Proceeds" received by the Working Interest Owners during a particular period, minus certain production and capital costs for such period. "Gross Proceeds" is defined in the Conveyance as the amount received by the Working Interest Owners from the sale of "Subject Minerals", subject to certain adjustments. "Subject Minerals" means all oil, gas and other minerals, whether similar or dissimilar, in and under, and which may be produced, saved and sold from, and which accrue and are attributable to, the Subject Interests from and after November 1, 1979. "Production costs" means, generally, costs incurred on an accrual basis by the Working Interest Owners in operating the Royalty Properties, including capital and non-capital costs. If production and capital costs exceed Gross Proceeds for any month, the excess, plus interest thereon at 120% of the prime rate of Bank of America, is recovered out of future Gross Proceeds prior to the making of further payment to the Trust. The Trust, however, is generally not liable for any operating costs or other costs or liabilities attributable to the Royalty Properties or minerals produced therefrom. The Trust is not obligated to return any Royalty income received in any period. 
         The Working Interest Owners are required to maintain books and records sufficient to determine the amounts payable under the Royalty. Additionally, in the event of a controversy between a Working Interest Owner and any purchaser as to the correct sales price for any production, amounts received by such Working Interest Owner and promptly deposited by it with an escrow agent are not considered to have been received by such Working Interest Owner, and, therefore, are not subject to being payable with respect to the Royalty until the controversy is resolved; but all amounts thereafter paid to such Working Interest Owner by the escrow agent will be considered amounts received from the sale of production. Similarly, operating costs include any amounts a Working Interest Owner is required to pay whether as a refund, interest or penalty to any purchaser because the amount initially received by such Working Interest Owner as the sales price was in excess of that permitted by the terms of any applicable contract, statute, regulation, order, decree or other obligation. Within 30 days following the close of each calendar quarter, the Working Interest Owners are required to deliver to the Trustee a statement of the computation of Net Proceeds attributable to such quarter. 
         The brief discussions of the Trust Indenture and the Conveyance contained herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Trust Indenture and the Conveyance themselves, which are exhibits to this Form 10-K and are available upon request from the Trustee.

     DESCRIPTION OF THE UNITS 
        Each unit of beneficial interest is evidenced by a transferable certificate issued by the Trustee. Each unit ranks equally for purposes of distributions and has one vote on any matter submitted to unitholders. A total of 1,863,590 units were outstanding at April 1, 2019. 
 Distributions 
         The Trustee determines for each month the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders for such month (the "Monthly Distribution Amount"), which consists of the cash received from the Royalty during such month, minus the obligations of the Trust paid during such month as adjusted for changes during such month in any cash reserves established for the payment of contingent or future obligations of the Trust made by the Trustee. The Monthly Distribution Amount for each month is payable to unitholders of record on the monthly record date, which is the close of business on the last business day of such month or such other date as the Trustee determines is required to comply with legal or stock exchange requirements. However, pursuant to the Trust Indenture and in order to reduce the administrative expenses of the Trust, the Trustee does not distribute cash monthly. Instead, the Trustee makes distributions during January, April, July and October of each year. While distributions are only made four times per calendar year, the Trustee distributes to each person who was a unitholder of record on one or more of the immediately preceding three monthly record dates, an amount equal to the Monthly Distribution Amount for the month or months that such holder was a unitholder of record plus interest earned on such Monthly Distribution Amount from the Monthly Record Date to the payment date. Under the terms of the Trust Indenture, interest is earned at a rate of 1.5% below the greater of (i) the prime rate charged by The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. or (ii) the interest rate which The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. pays in the normal course of business on amounts placed with it. Interest income may vary significantly across different payment dates. 
         The Working Interest Owners reimburse the Trust for portions of the total expenses incurred each month. The portions of expenses incurred by the Trustee without reimbursement from the Working Interest Owners are unreimbursed expenses. Unreimbursed expenses for any reporting period and are included in general and administrative expenses, which results in a reduction of distributable income. As of December 31, 2018, there were $0 of unreimbursed expenses. 
         The terms of the Trust Indenture provide, among other things, that the Trustee may establish cash reserves and borrow funds to pay liabilities of the Trust and may pledge assets of the Trust to secure payment of the borrowings. During 2011, the Trustee withheld $1.0 million for future unknown contingent liabilities and expenses in accordance with the Trust Indenture. At any given time, the amount reserved for such future unknown contingent liabilities and expenses (the "Contingent Reserve") is included in cash and short-term investments. 
         For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Trustee increased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $55,725 of Royalty income received from BP in March 2018 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of March 2018, which Royalty income was included in the April 2018 distribution to unitholders, (2) $3,627 of Royalty income received from BP in June 2018 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of June 2018, which Royalty income was included in the July 2018 distribution to unitholders, (3) $14,501 of general and administrative expense not reimbursed by Riviera (formerly Linn) in June 2018 but included in the June 2018 distribution to unitholders, which reimbursement was received in July 2018, (4) $3,000 of general and administrative expense not reimbursed by Riviera in September 2018 but included in the September 2018 distribution to unitholders, which reimbursement was received in October 2018 and (5) $38,364 cash refund from a vendor received in November 2018. 
 5

           For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Trustee decreased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $49,211 of Royalty income received from BP in December 2017 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of December 2017, which Royalty income was included in the January 2018 distribution to unitholders, (2) $70,460 of December 2017 expenses that were included in the distribution calculation for December 2017, but not paid by the Trust until January 2018, (3) $55,725 of Royalty income received from BP in March 2018 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of March 2018, which Royalty income was included in the April 2018 distribution to unitholders, (4) $3,627 of Royalty income received from BP in June 2018 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of June 2018, which Royalty income was included in the July 2018 distribution to unitholders, (5) $14,501 of general and administrative expense not reimbursed by Riviera (formerly Linn) in June 2018 but included in the June 2018 distribution to unitholders, which reimbursement was received in July 2018 and (6) $3,000 of general and administrative expense not reimbursed by Riviera in September 2018 but included in the September 2018 distribution to unitholders, which reimbursement was received in October 2018. 
         The net effects of the foregoing adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulted in the balance of the Contingent Reserve being equal to $1,038,364 as of December 31, 2018. 
         For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Trustee increased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $82,244 of Royalty income received from BP in March 2017 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of March 2017, which Royalty income was included in the April 2017 distribution to unitholders, (2) $47,840 of Royalty income received from BP in June 2017 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of June 2017, which Royalty income was included in the July 2017 distribution to unitholders, (3) $1,307 for the amount of September expected expense reimbursement cash receipts, received in October 2017, (4) $49,211 of Royalty income received from BP in December 2017 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of December 2017, which Royalty income was included in the January 2018 distribution to unitholders and (5) $70,460 of December 2017 expenses that were included in the distribution calculation for December 2017, but not paid by the Trust until January 2018. 
         For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Trustee decreased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $82,244 and $47,840 of aggregate Royalty income received from BP in March 2017 and June 2017, respectively, and (2) $1,307 for expected expense reimbursement cash receipts. The net effects of the foregoing adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted in the balance of the Contingent Reserve being equal to $1,119,671 as of December 31, 2017. 
   Liability of Unitholders 
         In regard to the unitholders, the Trustee is fully liable if the Trustee incurs any liability without ensuring that such liability will be satisfiable only out of the Trust's assets (regardless of whether the assets are adequate to satisfy the liability) and in no event out of amounts distributed to, or other assets owned by, the unitholders. However, under Texas law, it is unclear whether a unitholder would be jointly and severally liable for any liability of the Trust in the event that all of the following conditions were to occur: (1) the satisfaction of such liability was not by contract limited to the assets of the Trust, (2) the assets of the Trust were insufficient to discharge such liability, and (3) the assets of the Trustee were insufficient to discharge such liability. 
 Federal Income Tax Matters 
         This section is a summary of federal income tax matters of general application, which addresses the material tax consequences of the ownership and sale of the Trust's units. Except where indicated, the discussion below describes general federal income tax considerations applicable to individuals who are citizens or residents of the U.S. Accordingly, the following discussion has limited application to 
 6

   domestic corporations, foreign persons and persons subject to specialized federal income tax treatment, such as regulated investment companies and insurance companies. It is impractical to comment on all aspects of federal, state, local and foreign laws that may affect the tax consequences of the transactions contemplated hereby and of an investment in the units as they relate to the particular circumstances of every unitholder. Each unitholder should consult its own tax advisor with respect to its particular circumstances.
 


Classification of the Trust 

         In a technical advice memorandum dated February 26, 1982, the National Office of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") advised the Dallas District Director that the Trust is classifiable as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation. As a grantor trust, the Trust incurs no federal income tax liability and each unitholder is subject to tax on such unitholder's pro rata share of the income and expense of the Trust as if such unitholder were the direct owner of a pro rata share of the Trust's assets. In addition, there is no state tax liability for the period. 
         The Trustee assumes that some Trust units are held by a middleman, as such term is broadly defined in U.S. Treasury Regulations (and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners, and brokers holding an interest for a custodian in street name). Therefore, the Trustee considers the Trust to be a non-mortgage widely held fixed investment trust ("WHFIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the middlemen holding units on behalf of unitholders, and not the Trustee of the Trust, are solely responsible for complying with the information reporting requirements under the Treasury Regulations with respect to such units, including the issuance of IRS Forms 1099 and certain written tax statements. Unitholders whose units are held by middlemen should consult with such middlemen regarding the information that will be reported to them by the middlemen with respect to the units. 
 


Available Trust Tax Information 

         The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., 601 Travis Street, Floor 16, Houston, Texas 77002, telephone number 713-483-6020, is the representative of the Trust that will provide tax information in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations (as defined below) governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a WHFIT. In compliance with the Treasury Regulations reporting requirements for WHFITs and the dissemination of Trust tax reporting information, the Trustee provides a tax information reporting booklet which is intended to be used only to assist Trust unitholders in the preparation of their federal income tax returns. This tax information booklet can be obtained at http://mtr.investorhq.businesswire.com/. 
         U.S. federal tax reform informally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") was enacted on December 22, 2017 and made significant changes to the federal income tax rules applicable to both individuals and entities, including changes to the effective tax rate on a unitholder's allocable share of certain income from the Trust. The TCJA is complex and some areas lack administrative guidance. Thus, unitholders should consult their tax advisor regarding the TCJA and its effect on an investment in Trust units. 
         This summary is based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"), existing and proposed Internal Revenue Treasury Regulations ("Treasury Regulations") thereunder and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to changes that may or may not be retroactively applied. No assurance can be provided that the statements set forth herein (which do not bind the IRS or any court) will not be challenged by the IRS or will be sustained by any court if challenged.

Income and Depletion 

         Royalty income, net of depletion and severance taxes, is portfolio income. Subject to certain exceptions and transitional rules, royalty income cannot be offset by passive losses. Additionally, interest income is portfolio income. 
         Generally, prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990, the transferee of an oil and gas property could not claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property if it was "proved" at the time of the transfer. This rule is not applicable in the case of transfers of properties after October 11, 1990. Thus, eligible unitholders who acquired units after that date are entitled to claim an allowance for percentage depletion with respect to Royalty income attributable to such units to the extent that this allowance exceeds cost depletion as computed for the applicable period. 
 


Backup Withholding 

         Distributions from the Trust are generally subject to backup withholding at a current rate of 24%. Backup withholding will not normally apply to distributions to a unitholder unless the unitholder fails to properly provide to the Trust its taxpayer identification number or the IRS notifies the Trust that the taxpayer identification number provided by the unitholder is incorrect. 
 


Sale of Units 

         Generally, except for recapture items, the sale, exchange or other disposition of a unit will result in capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the tax basis in the unit and the amount realized. Effective for property placed in service after December 31, 1986, the amount of gain, if any, realized upon the disposition of oil and gas property is treated as ordinary income up to the amount of intangible drilling and development costs incurred with respect to the property and depletion claimed to the extent it reduced the taxpayer's basis in the property. Under this provision, depletion attributable to a unit acquired after 1986 will be subject to recapture as ordinary income upon disposition of the unit or upon disposition of the oil and gas property to which the depletion is attributable. The balance of any gain or any loss will be capital gain or loss if the unit was held by the unitholder as a capital asset, either long-term or short-term depending on the holding period of the unit. This capital gain or loss will be long-term if a unitholder's holding period exceeds one year at the time of sale or exchange. Under current law, the highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to long-term capital gains of individuals is 20%. Moreover, this rate is subject to change by new legislation at any time. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations. Capital gain or loss will be short-term if the unit has not been held for more than one year at the time of sale or exchange. 
 


Additional Tax on Net Investment Income 

         Individuals, estates, and trusts with income above certain thresholds are subject under Section 1411 of the Code to an additional 3.8% taxalso known as the Net Investment Income Tax ("NIIT")on their net investment income. Grantor trusts such as Mesa Royalty Trust are not subject to the NIIT; however, the unitholders may be subject to the tax. For these purposes, investment income would generally include certain income derived from investments, such as the royalty income derived from the units and gain realized by a unitholder from a sale of the units. 
 


Non-U.S. Unitholders 

         In general, a unitholder who is a nonresident alien individual or which is a foreign corporation, each a "non-U.S. unitholder" for purposes of this discussion, will be subject to tax on the gross income (without taking into account any deductions, such as depletion) produced by the Royalty at a rate equal to 30% or, if applicable, at a lower treaty rate. This tax will be withheld by the Trustee and remitted directly to the U.S. Treasury. A non-U.S. unitholder may elect to treat Royalty income as effectively 
 8

   connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business under provisions of the Code or pursuant to any similar provisions of applicable treaties. Upon making this election, a non-U.S. unitholder is entitled to claim all deductions with respect to that income, but he must file a U.S. federal income tax return to claim these deductions. This election once made is irrevocable unless an applicable treaty allows the election to be made annually. 
         The Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder treat the publicly traded Trust as if it were a U.S. real property holding corporation. Accordingly, a non-U.S. unitholder may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the gain on the disposition of his units if he meets certain ownership thresholds. 
         In addition, if a foreign corporation elects under provisions of the Code to treat Royalty income as effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, the corporation may also be subject to the U.S. branch profits tax at a rate of 30%. This tax is imposed on U.S. branch profits of a foreign corporation that are not reinvested in the U.S. trade or business and is in addition to the tax on effectively connected income. The branch profits tax may be either reduced or eliminated by treaty. Federal income taxation of a non-U.S. unitholder is a highly complex matter which may be affected by many considerations. Therefore, each non-U.S. unitholder is encouraged to consult with his own tax advisor with respect to its ownership of Trust units. 
         Pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (commonly referred to as "FATCA"), distributions from the Trust to "foreign financial institutions" and certain other "non-financial foreign entities" may be subject to U.S. withholding taxes. Specifically, certain "withholdable payments" (including certain royalties, interest and other gains or income from U.S. sources) made to a foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity will generally be subject to the withholding tax unless the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity complies with certain information reporting, withholding, identification, certification and related requirements imposed by FATCA. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the U.S. governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. Foreign unitholders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of these withholding provisions on their investment in Trust units. 
 


Tax-Exempt Organizations 

         The Royalty and interest income should not be "unrelated business taxable income" (as defined in Code § 512(b)), so long as, generally, a unitholder did not incur debt to acquire a unit or otherwise incur or maintain a debt that would not have been incurred or maintained if the unit had not been acquired. Legislative proposals have been made from time to time which, if adopted, would result in the treatment of Royalty income as unrelated business taxable income. Each tax-exempt unitholder is encouraged to consult its own advisor with respect to the treatment of Royalty income.

  (1)
The Trust does not have a working interest in the producing acres and producing gas wells. The gross and net amounts in the table above represent gross and net amounts attributable to the Working Interest Owners and are the basis for the Gross Proceeds amounts discussed under "Description of the Trust". 


  Hugoton Royalty Properties 
         The principal property interest conveyed to the Trust accounts was carved out of Riviera's working interest in 104,437 net producing acres in the Hugoton field of Kansas. 
         Because the Hugoton field gas is sold in the intrastate and interstate markets, it is subject to state and federal laws and regulations. The Kansas Corporation Commission is the state regulatory agency responsible for overseeing oil and gas operations in the state of Kansas. Hugoton field gas is also affected by the rules and regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the "FERC"). See "Regulation and Prices". 
   San Juan Basin Royalty Properties 
         The Trust's interest in the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties was conveyed from PNR's working interest in 31,328 net producing acres in Northwestern New Mexico and Southwestern Colorado. PNR completed the San Juan Basin Sale to ConocoPhillips on April 30, 1991. ConocoPhillips subsequently sold its underlying interest in substantially all of the San Juan BasinColorado Properties to MarkWest Energy Partners, Ltd. (effective January 1, 1993) and Red Willow Production Company (effective April 1, 1992). On October 26, 1994, MarkWest Energy Partners, Ltd. sold substantially all of its interest in the San Juan BasinColorado Properties to BP. Starting from the date of the San Juan Basin Sale and ending on July 31, 2017, ConocoPhillips operated substantially all of the San Juan BasinNew Mexico Properties, except for an immaterial number of properties assigned to XTO effective January 1, 2005. On July 31, 2017, ConocoPhillips sold its San Juan Basin assets to Hilcorp. On March 29, 2018, XTO sold to Hilcorp an immaterial number of properties, which comprise certain portions of the San Juan BasinNew Mexico Properties. 
 Drilling 
         There were no exploratory wells drilled on any Royalty Properties during 2018, 2017 or 2016. 
   Reserves 
         A study of the proved oil and gas reserves covering the Hugoton Royalty Properties and San Juan Basin Royalty Properties (the "Reserve Report") and attributable to the Trust has been made by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, independent petroleum engineering consultants, as of December 31, 2018. A copy of this Reserve Report has been filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K. DeGolyer and

         The Reserve Report reflects estimated production, reserve quantities and future net revenue based upon estimates of the future timing of actual production without regard to when received in cash by the Trust, which differs from the manner in which the Trust recognizes and accounts for its Royalty income. 
         Estimates of the gross and net proved reserves, as of December 31, 2018, of the Trust's ownership in the net overriding royalty interests in the Royalty Properties are presented below. Total liquid reserves (condensate and natural gas liquids) are expressed in thousands of barrels (Mbbl) and gas reserves are expressed in thousands of cubic feet (Mcf).

Data from Red Willow and properties formerly operated by XTO, currently operated by Hilcorp, was omitted in the Reserve Report, because each operates an immaterial number of wells relative to the total number of wells currently producing from the Royalty Properties. Excess production costs related to Red Willow and properties formerly operated by XTO, currently operated by Hilcorp, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are included in Net Proceeds paid to the Trust by Red Willow and Hilcorp. 


        The estimated future net revenue and standardized measure of future net royalty income, discounted at 10 percent per annum attributable to the Trust's Royalty as of December 31, 2018 is

        Please read "Summary Reserve Report from DeGolyer and MacNaughton" attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 for more information. 
         The Reserve Report was delivered to the Trustee on March 29, 2019. Net reserves of the Trust's Royalty are calculated at the aggregate level from the net revenue of each of the Working Interest Owners. To estimate net gas reserves, the total net revenue of the Working Interest Owners is divided by the net value of 1 Mcf of gas. The net value of 1 Mcf of gas is the gas price per Mcf, plus the condensate value per Mcf of gas, plus the NGL value per Mcf of gas. The net condensate and NGL reserves are calculated by multiplying their respective yields by the net gas reserves. Revenue values used in the Reserve Report were estimated using the following prices: (1) condensate prices$33.93 per Bbl; (2) natural gas liquids prices$14.73 per Bbl for the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties and $25.98 per Bbl for Hugoton Royalty Properties; and (3) natural gas prices$1.84 per Mcf for San Juan Basin-New Mexico Royalty Properties, $1.20 per Mcf for San Juan Basin-Colorado Royalty Properties and $3.46 per Mcf for Hugoton Royalty Properties, with the initial prices also used as weighted average prices held constant thereafter over the lives of the properties. Estimates of operating expenses were based on current expenses and used for the life of the Royalty Properties with no increases in the future based on inflation. 
   Preparation of Reserve Estimates 
         For further information regarding the Net Overriding Royalty Interest, the Basis of Accounting and Supplemental Reserve Information, see Notes 1, 2 and 7, respectively, in the Notes to Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
         There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. Reserve data included above and in these reports represents estimates only and should not be construed as being exact. The discounted present values shown by the Reserve Report should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated gas and oil reserves attributable to the Royalty Properties or the costs that would be incurred to obtain equivalent reserves, since a market value determination would include many additional factors. 
         The Trustee has been advised that each of the foregoing estimates were prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"). Accordingly, the estimates are based on existing economic and operating conditions in effect at December 31, 2018, with no provision for future increases or decreases except for periodic price redeterminations in accordance with existing gas contracts. Actual future prices and costs may be materially greater or less than the assumed amounts in the reserve reports. Because reserve reports are limited to proved reserves, future capital expenditures for recovery of reserves not classified as proved are not included in the calculation of estimated future net revenues. Reserve assessment is a subjective 
 12

   process of estimating the recovery from underground accumulations of gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way, and estimates of other persons might differ materially from those of DeGolyer and MacNaughton. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of hydrocarbons that are ultimately recovered. 
         The Trustee relies on DeGolyer and MacNaughton to prepare the reserve estimates attributable to the Trust's interests in the Royalty Properties. Although the Trustee inquires with the third-party reserve engineer about the information provided by the Working Interest Owners and the assumptions made and methodologies used by the third-party reserve engineer, the Trustee does not control the information provided by the Working Interest Owners or the assumptions made or methodologies used by the third-party reserve engineer. Accordingly, such information is outside the scope of the internal controls of the Trust and the Trustee. Any past practices not consistent with the Conveyance could also cause the basis for the reserve estimates included above to differ from actual reserve quantities and future net revenues. 
   Income, Production and Production Prices and Production Costs 
         Sales and production data from the Royalty Properties for the last three fiscal years is included in the table below. For additional information related to our Reserve Report, see "Note 7Supplemental Reserve Information" under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

  (1)
Average production costs attributable to the Royalty are calculated as stated capital costs plus operating costs, divided by stated net production volumes attributable to the Royalty paid. Production costs may be incurred in one operating period and then recovered in a subsequent operating period, which may cause Royalty income paid to the Trust not to agree to the Trust's Royalty interest in the Net Proceeds. 
(2)
Net production volumes attributable to the Royalty are determined by dividing Royalty income by the average sales price received. Any differences noted are due to rounding. 
(3)
In order to more closely align the reporting and payment of Royalty income from the San Juan BasinColorado Properties operated by BP, the Trustee elected to report BP's production from December 2016 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Historically, BP's December production month has correlated to the Trust's January accounting month. However, such election did not impact Royalty income or cash in the Trust's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, because the San Juan BasinColorado Properties operated by BP generated excess production costs of $3,860 during the December 2016 production month and no payment was due to the Trust by BP. The effect of the Trustee's election to include the December 2016 production month for the year ended December 31, 2016 is as follows: (i) the Summary of Royalty Income, Production, Prices and Costs include the Trust's proportionate share of gross proceeds of $68,327, the Trust's proportionate share of operating costs of $72,187, and net production volumes attributable to the Royalty paid of 40,163 Mcf, and (ii) $3,860 of excess production costs related to the San Juan BasinColorado Properties operated by BP as of December 31, 2016 were included in the Excess Production Costs footnote to the Trust's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
(4)
Following Hilcorp's acquisition of ConocoPhillips' and XTO's interests in the San JuanNew Mexico Properties, Hilcorp has made an estimated payment of Net Proceeds to the Trust each month consistent with the monthly amounts previously paid by ConocoPhillips and XTO. As a result of the payment of estimated Net Proceeds, Hilcorp has informed the Trust that it will reconcile estimated versus actual revenue figures once it finalizes installation of its revenue decks, although Hilcorp has not indicated when such reconciliation may occur. At the time that Hilcorp reconciles estimated versus actual revenue numbers, such estimations and reconciliations by Hilcorp will be added to or subtracted from future Net Proceeds paid to the Trust in accordance with the Trust's basis of financial presentation. Pursuant to the Trust Indenture, the Trust is not required to pay to Hilcorp any amounts that could be owed if the estimated revenue exceeded actual revenue figures in past periods, plus any additional required costs. However, Hilcorp may recover such amounts by withholding a portion or all of Net Proceeds that would otherwise be payable to the Trust in subsequent periods. This could result in a decrease in Net Proceeds paid to the Trust and could result in a future material reduction in distributions to the Trust's unitholders.

        CONTRACTS 
  Hugoton Royalty Properties 
         Natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by Riviera (formerly Linn) from the Hugoton Royalty Properties accounted for approximately 33% of the Royalty income of the Trust for the year ended December 31, 2018. Riviera has advised the Trust that since June 1, 1995 natural gas produced from the Hugoton field has generally been sold under short-term and multi-month contracts at market clearing prices to multiple purchasers. Riviera has advised the Trust that it expects to continue to market natural gas production from the Hugoton field under short-term and multi-month contracts. Overall average daily market prices received for natural gas from Hugoton Royalty Properties were lower for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Riviera has provided and continues to provide Process (as defined in the Conveyance) services for the Hugoton Royalty Properties, and such services are charged against the Royalty in accordance with the terms of the Conveyance. 
 San Juan Basin 
         Natural gas, oil, condensate and natural gas liquids produced from the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties accounted for approximately 67% of the Royalty income of the Trust for the year ended December 31, 2018. The majority of the natural gas produced from the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties is now being sold on the spot market. 
 Market for Natural Gas 
         The amount of cash distributions by the Trust is dependent on, among other things, the sales prices realized for natural gas produced from the Royalty Properties and the quantities of gas sold. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy, the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Prices were $2.99 per MMBtu in 2017 and increased to $3.17 per MMBtu in 2018. Due to the seasonal nature of demand for natural gas and its effects on sales prices and production volumes, the amounts of cash distributions by the Trust may vary substantially on a seasonal basis. Generally, production volumes and prices are higher during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year due primarily to peak demand in those periods. Because of the time lag between the date on which the Working Interest Owners receive payment for production from the Royalty Properties and the date on which distributions are made to unitholders, the seasonality that generally affects production volumes and prices is generally reflected in distributions to unitholders in later periods. Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Prices are quoted in MMBtu, a commonly used energy measurement that has a conversion formula defined and published by the SEC for the purpose of estimating price per Mcf in the Reserve Report. 
 Competition 
         The production and sale of gas from the Royalty Properties are highly competitive, and the Working Interest Owners' competitors in these areas include the major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, and individual producers and operators. There are numerous producers in the Hugoton field and the San Juan Basin. The Working Interest Owners have advised the Trust that they believe that their competitive position in their respective areas is affected by price, contract terms and quality of service. Riviera has also advised the Trust that it believes that its competitive position in the Hugoton field is enhanced by virtue of its substantial holdings and ownership and control of its wells, gathering systems and processing plants. Market conditions in the San Juan Basin are negatively affected by the fact that most of the gas produced from such areas is transported on one of only two major pipelines, and the transportation of such gas is generally controlled by a few distribution companies.

     REGULATION AND PRICES 
  General 
         The production and sale of natural gas from the Royalty Properties are affected from time to time in varying degrees by political developments and federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, oil and gas production operations and economics are, or in the past have been, affected by price controls, taxes, conservation, safety, environmental and other laws relating to the petroleum industry, by changes in such laws, and by constantly changing administrative regulations. 
   FERC Regulation 
         In general, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the "FERC") regulates the sale of natural gas in interstate commerce for resale and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce by pipelines, but does not regulate natural gas gathering facilities. The FERC adopted regulations resulting in a restructuring of the natural gas industry. The principal elements of this restructuring were the requirement that interstate pipelines separate, or "unbundle," into individual components the various services offered on their systems, with all transportation services to be provided on a non-discriminatory basis, and the prohibition against an interstate pipeline providing gas sales services except through separately-organized affiliates. In various rulemaking proceedings following its initial unbundling requirement, the FERC has refined its regulatory program applicable to interstate pipelines in various respects, and it has announced that it will continue to monitor these and other regulations to determine whether further changes are needed. In addition to rulemaking proceedings, the FERC establishes new policies and regulations through policy statements and adjudications of individual pipeline matters. Further, additional changes to regulations may occur based on actions taken by Congress and/or the courts. As to these various developments, the Working Interest Owners have advised the Trust that the on-going and evolving nature of these regulatory initiatives makes it impossible to predict their ultimate impact on the prices, markets or terms of sale of natural gas related to the Trust. 
         In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and culminated in adoption of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act that removed all price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. 
         Sales of crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls at any time in the future. Sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is subject to rate and access regulation. The FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate oil pipeline rates must be just and reasonable and may be derived in a number of ways including, but not limited to, the FERC's indexing methodology. 
         As to these various types of regulation, the on-going and evolving nature of these regulatory initiatives makes it impossible to predict their ultimate impact on the prices, markets or terms of sale of natural gas related to the Trust. 
   State and Other Regulation 
         Each of the jurisdictions encompassing the Royalty Properties has statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas. The regulations often require permits for the drilling of wells and may specify rules related to the spacing of wells, the prevention of waste of oil and gas resources, the rate of production, the prevention and clean-up of pollution, and other matters. 
 15

           State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental, and in some circumstances, non-discriminatory take and common purchaser requirements, as well as complaint-based rate regulation. 
         Natural gas pipeline facilities used for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce are subject to federal minimum safety requirements. These requirements, however, are not applicable to, among other things, onshore gathering of gas (i) through a pipeline that operates at less than 0 psig; (ii) through a pipeline that is not a regulated onshore gathering line (as determined in 49 C.F.R. § 192.8); and (iii) within the inlets of the Gulf of Mexico, except for the requirements in 49 C.F.R. § 192.612. The Royalty Properties are located in the Hugoton field of Kansas and the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and Colorado. Each of Colorado, Kansas and New Mexico has adopted the federal minimum safety requirements for intrastate pipelines within their borders. The standards governing pipeline safety have undergone recent changes, and it is possible that future changes in applicable law may increase the stringency of the standards or expand the applicability of the standards to facilities not currently covered. 
   Environmental Matters 
         The Working Interest Owners' operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations controlling the discharge and release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations, including their state counterparts, can impose liability upon the owner, operator or lessee under a lease for the cost of cleanup of discharged and released materials or damages to natural resources resulting from oil and gas operations. These laws and regulations may, among other things:


 restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be discharged and released into the environment in connection
with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities; 
 limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and 
 require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned
wells. 

         Violations of environmental laws, regulations, or permits can result in civil and criminal penalties as well as potential injunctions curtailing operations in affected areas. The Working Interest Owners have advised the Trust that they are not at this time involved in any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the Royalty Properties arising under federal, state or local environmental protection laws and regulations or which would have a material adverse effect on the Working Interest Owners' financial position or results of operations. The Working Interest Owners have also advised the Trust that they maintain insurance for costs of cleanup obligations, but that they are not fully insured against all such risks. 
         The following is a summary of certain material laws, rules and regulations to which the operations of the Royalty Properties may be subject. 
         Hazardous Substances.    The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as "CERCLA" or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, potentially without regard to fault or legality of the activity at the time, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances that have been released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into 
 16

   the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of health studies. In addition, neighboring landowners and other third parties may file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. 
         The Royalty Properties have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years. Although the Working Interest Owners believe that they have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties, or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, the Royalty Properties may have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons was not under the Working Interest Owners' control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, federal hazardous waste laws, and analogous state laws. Under such laws, the Working Interest Owners could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination regardless of whether or not such Working Interest Owner directly or indirectly caused the unpermitted discharge or release. 
         In addition, in the course of the Working Interest Owners' operations, equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radiation associated with oil and natural gas deposits, and this exposure may result in the generation of wastes containing naturally occurring radioactive materials ("NORM"). NORM wastes exhibiting trace levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. Because some properties presently or previously comprising the Royalty Properties may have been used for oil and natural gas production operations for many years, it is possible that the Working Interest Owners may incur costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of NORM. 
  Waste Handling.    The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, referred to as "RCRA," and comparable state statutes, regulate the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Some wastes associated with the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are exempted from the most stringent regulation in certain circumstances, such as drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas. However, these wastes and other wastes may be otherwise regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") or state agencies. Moreover, in the ordinary course of oil and gas operations, industrial wastes such as paint wastes and waste solvents may be regulated as hazardous waste under RCRA or considered hazardous substances under CERCLA. It is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. 
         Water Discharges.    The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the "Clean Water Act") and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into regulated waters. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the "OPA"), as amended, which amends the Clean Water Act, imposes strict liability on owners and operators of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into regulated waters. The OPA and its associated regulations impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal or state law may require appropriate operating protocols, including containment berms and similar structures, to help prevent or respond to a petroleum hydrocarbon spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws may require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities or during construction activities.

           Hydraulic Fracturing.    It is customary to recover oil and natural gas from deep shale, tight sand and coal bed formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling. Conventional hydraulic fracturing techniques are used to increase production in vertical wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Underground Injection Control provisions of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act to exclude certain hydraulic fracturing activities from the definition of "underground injection." At present, hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the state and local level. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal, state and local level and in some states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. Repeal of the exemption would allow the EPA to promulgate new regulations. Many states have adopted rules that required operators to disclose chemicals and water volumes associated with hydraulic fracturing. In addition, hydraulic fracturing requires large amounts of water. This water, along with any produced water, is often sent to injection wells for disposal. This activity has been associated with earthquakes and some states, particularly Oklahoma, have limited injection well activity. If states in which the Working Interest Owners' operate adopt limitations, it could have a negative impact on production. 
  Air Emissions.    The federal Clean Air Act, and comparable state laws, restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including drilling operations and related equipment, and as a result affect oil and natural gas operations. The EPA has also developed, and continues to give attention to, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources, including oil and gas operations. Air emissions permits may be required for some oil and gas production operations. 
         Climate Change.    The EPA has promulgated certain regulations that require new and modified stationary source of greenhouse gases above certain thresholds to report, limit or control such emissions, including rules to control methane emissions. Although subject to legal challenge, the EPA rules promulgated thus far are currently final and effective and will remain so unless overturned by a court, or unless Congress adopts legislation altering the EPA's regulatory authority. Recently, EPA proposed rules to stay certain portions of the rules promulgated to control greenhouse gas emission related to oil and gas production. In addition, some states have taken or proposed legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. For example, a number of states, including states in which the Royalty Properties are located, have indicated an intent to reduce greenhouse gases through state action or regional partnerships. 
  Safety.    The Working Interest Owners are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, known as "OSHA," and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced by oil and gas operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public.
