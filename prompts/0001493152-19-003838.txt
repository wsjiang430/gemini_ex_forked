Overview
 
The Company is a radiation oncology medical device company engaged in the development of its yttrium-90 based brachytherapy device, RadioGel™, for the treatment of non-resectable tumors. A prominent team of radiochemists, scientists and engineers, collaborating with strategic partners, including national laboratories, universities and private corporations, lead the Company’s development efforts. The Company’s overall vision is to globally empower physicians, medical researchers and patients by providing them with new isotope technologies that offer safe and effective treatments for cancer.
 
In January 2018, the Center for Veterinary Medicine Product Classification Group ruled that RadioGelTM should be classified as a device for animal therapy of feline sarcomas and canine soft tissue sarcomas. Additionally, after a legal review, the Company believes that the device classification obtained from the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Center for Veterinary Medicine is not limited to canine and feline sarcomas, but rather may be extended to a much broader population of veterinary cancers, including all or most solid tumors in animals. We expect the result of such classification and label review will be that no additional regulatory approvals are necessary for the use of IsoPet® for the treatment of solid tumors in animals. The FDA does not have premarket authority over devices with a veterinary classification, and the manufacturers are responsible for assuring that the product is safe, effective, properly labeled, and otherwise in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
 
Based on the FDA’s recommendation, RadioGelTM will be marketed as “IsoPet®” for use by veterinarians to avoid any confusion between animal and human therapy. The Company already has trademark protection for the “IsoPet®” name. IsoPet® and RadioGelTM are used synonymously throughout this document. The only distinction between IsoPet® and RadioGelTM is the FDA’s recommendation that we use “IsoPet®” for veterinarian usage, and reserve “RadioGelTM” for human therapy. Based on these developments, the Company has shifted its primary focus to the development and marketing of Isopet® for animal therapy, through the Company’s IsoPet® Solutions division.
 
The Company’s IsoPet Solutions division was established in May 2016 to focus on the veterinary oncology market, namely engagement of university veterinarian hospital to develop the detailed therapy procedures to treat animal tumors and ultimately use of the technology in private clinics. The Company has worked with three different university veterinarian hospitals on IsoPet® testing and therapy. Washington State University treated five cats for feline sarcoma and served to develop the procedures which are incorporated in our label. They concluded that the product was safe and effective in killing cancer cells. Colorado State University demonstrated the CT and PET-CT imaging of IsoPet®. A contract was signed with University of Missouri to treat canine sarcomas and equine sarcoids starting in November 2017. To date, three dogs, listed below as Dog A, Dog B and Dog C, respectively, have been treated with IsoPet® at the University of Missouri.
 
Dog A was treated for canine soft tissue sarcoma in June 2018. Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (“RECIST”) is a set of published rules that define when tumors in cancer patients improve (respond), stay the same (stabilize), or worsen (progress) during treatment. The criteria were published by an international collaboration including the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), National Cancer Institute of the United States, and the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group. The principal investigator from the University of Missouri rated the tumor as CR, Complete Response, after three months. This RECIST rating means that the tumor was completely eliminated by the IsoPet therapy. Dog B which was treated in July 2018 has displayed encouraging results. This patient had transient mild acute radiation side effects, and had SD (stable disease) at the time of recheck. There was a small amount of growth, but not enough to be considered progression per the RECIST criteria. The CT on its last visit in February 2019 showed that the tumor site had a slightly larger but diffuse image. Based on this single observation, the diffuse image could mean that the hydrogel, in addition to trapping the particles, provides a secondary benefit of locking in the dead tumor tissue allowing for a slower rate of resorption of the necrotic tissue. This could be a positive outcome whereas killing a tumor and having it resorb within the tissue all at once might be a shock to the animal’s system. We will continue to monitor how this case proceeds.


Dog C was treated in January 2019. This very large, half-pound, tumor was initially scheduled for therapy in December 2018 but had to be rescheduled due to the hydrogel not meeting our rigid specifications. From this, we learned that frozen hydrogel has a limited shelf life and this allowed us to make the appropriate adjustments to our product specifications. This patient had mild to moderate acute radiation side effects and has SD (stable disease) one-month post treatment. The February follow-up included a CT scan. The mass showed no new growth and measured almost the same as it did at the time of treatment. There is a small region at the bottom of the tumor where the mass seems to be draining. The tumor around the highest dose region appears dead with no blood supply, according to the CT. Dog C was outside of the scope of our criteria as an eligible patient prospect and we deem the patient as likely terminal, however, we treated it for humanitarian reasons and for discovery to determine residual effects of the treatment. Dog D was treated for canine soft tissue sarcoma in February 2019, and we are awaiting a follow-up appointment for an examination of the dog. These animal therapies generate data to assure the private veterinary clinics of the safety and efficacy of IsoPet®.
 
The Company anticipates that future revenue and profits, if any, will be derived from direct sales of RadioGel™ (under the name IsoPet®) and related services, and from licensing to private medical and veterinary clinics in the U.S. and internationally.
 
Our plan is to incorporate the data assembled from our work with Isopet® in animal therapy to support the Company’s efforts in the development of our RadioGel™ device candidate, including obtaining approval from the FDA to market and sell RadioGel™ as a Class II medical device. RadioGel™ is an injectable particle-gel for brachytherapy radiation treatment of cancerous tumors in people and animals. RadioGel™ is comprised of a hydrogel, or a substance that is liquid at room temperature and then gels when reaching body temperature after injection into a tumor. In the gel are small, one micron, yttrium-90 phosphate particles (“Y-90”). Once injected, these inert particles are locked in place inside the tumor by the gel, delivering a very high local radiation dose. The radiation is beta, consisting of high-speed electrons. These electrons only travel a short distance so the device can deliver high radiation to the tumor with minimal dose to the surrounding tissue. Optimally, patients can go home immediately following treatment without the risk of radiation exposure to family members. Since Y-90 has a half-life of 2.7 days, the radioactivity drops to 5% of its original value after ten days.

The Company’s lead brachytherapy products, including RadioGel™, incorporate patented technology developed for Battelle Memorial Institute (“Battelle”) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a leading research institute for government and commercial customers. Battelle has granted the Company an exclusive license to patents covering the manufacturing, processing and applications of RadioGel™ (the “Battelle License”). This exclusive license is to terminate upon the expiration of the last patent included in this agreement. Other intellectual property protection includes proprietary production processes and trademark protection in 17 countries. The Company plans to continue efforts to develop new refinements on the production process, and the product and application hardware, as a basis for future patents.
 
Vista Veterinary Hospital
 
Vista Veterinary Hospital (“Vista”) was selected as the pilot private clinic to initiate commercial sales of IsoPet®. It is good management practice to implement and learn from a pilot program before spreading to regional clinics across the country. Vista is located in the Tri-Cities Washington area which is convenient for interactions with key personnel of Vista Inc. The pilot is being used to

Regulatory History
 
Human Therapy
 
RadioGel™ has a long regulatory history with the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Initially, the Company submitted a presubmission (Q130140) to obtain FDA feedback about the proposed product. The FDA requested that the Company file a request for designation with the Office of Combination Products (RFD130051), which led to the determination that RadioGel™ is a device for human therapy for non-resectable cancers, which must be reviewed and ultimately regulated by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”). The Company then submitted a 510(k) notice for RadioGel™ (K133368), which was found Not Substantially Equivalent due to the lack of a suitable predicate, and RadioGel™ was assigned to the Class III product code NAW (microspheres). Class III products or devices are generally the highest risk devices and are therefore subject to the highest level of regulatory review, control and oversight. Class III products or devices must typically be approved by FDA before they are marketed. Class II devices represent lower risk products or devices than Class III and require fewer regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurance of the product’s or device’s safety and effectiveness. In contrast, Class I products and devices are deemed to be lower risk than Class I or II, and are therefore subject to the least regulatory controls.
 
A pre-submission meeting (Q140496) was held with the FDA on June 17, 2014, during which the FDA maintained that RadioGel™ should be considered a Class III device and therefore subject to pre-market approval. On December 29, 2014, the Company submitted a de novo petition for RadioGel™ (DEN140043). The de novo petition was denied by the FDA on June 1, 2015, with the FDA providing numerous comments and questions. On September 29, 2015, the Company submitted a follow-up pre-submission informational meeting request with the FDA (Q151569). This meeting took place on November 9, 2015, at which time the FDA indicated acceptance of the Company’s applied dosimetry methods and clarified the FDA’s outstanding questions regarding RadioGel™. Following the November 2015 pre-submission meeting, the Company prepared a new pre-submission package to obtain FDA feedback on the proposed testing methods, intended to address the concerns raised by the FDA staff and to address the suitability of RadioGel™ for de novo reclassification. This pre-submission package was presented to the FDA in a meeting on August 29, 2017. During the August 2017 meeting, the FDA clarified their position on the remaining pre-clinical testing needed for RadioGel™. Specifically, the FDA addressed proposed dosimetry calculating techniques, dosimetry distribution between injections, hydrogel viscoelastic properties, and the details of the Company’s proposed animal testing.
 
The Company believes that its submissions to the FDA to date have addressed all the FDA staff’s feedback over the past four years. Of particular importance, the Company has provided corresponding supporting data for proposed future testing of RadioGel™ to address any remaining questions raised by the FDA. We believe, although no assurances can be given, that the clinical testing modifications presented to the FDA in August 2017 will result in a de novo reclassification for RadioGel™ by the FDA. In addition, in previous FDA submittals, the Company proposed applying RadioGel™ for a very broad range of cancer therapies, referred to as Indication for Use. The FDA requested that the Company reduce its Indications for Use. To comply with that request, the Company expanded its Medical Advisory Board (“MAB”) and engaged doctors from respected hospitals who have evaluated the candidate cancer therapies based on three criteria: (1) potential for FDA approval and successful therapy; (2) notable advantage over current therapies; and (3) probability of wide spread acceptance by the medical community.

---


The MAB selected eighteen applications for RadioGel™, each of which meet the criteria described above. This large number confirms the wide applicability of the device and defines the path for future business growth. The Company’s application establishes a single Indication for Use - treatment of basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers. We anticipate that this initial application will facilitate each subsequent application for additional Indications for Use, and the testing for many of the subsequent applications could be conducted in parallel, depending on available resources.
 
In the event the FDA denies the Company’s application for de novo review, and therefore determines that RadioGel™ cannot be classified as a Class I or Class I1 device, the Company will then need to submit a pre-market approval application to obtain the necessary regulatory approval as a Class III device.


Financing and Strategy
 
Research and development of RadioGel™ and other products in the Company’s brachytherapy product line has been funded with proceeds from the sale of equity and debt securities as well as a series of grants. The Company requires funding of approximately $2.3 million annually to maintain current operating activities. Over the next two years, the Company believes it will cost approximately $5.0 million to fund: (1) the creation of a dedicated production line with IsoTherapeutics, our production supplier; (2) supplementing startup costs of the pilot and regional veterinary clinics; and (3) completion of the ore-clinical testing necessary to apply for an IDE, Investigational Device Exemption, which is necessary to initiate clinical testing in humans.
 
Our market development strategy focuses on commercializing IsoPet for animal therapy, while proceeding in parallel with the testing required by the FDA for human therapy. Based on recommendations from our Medical Advisory Board (“MAB”), we anticipate that the first human therapy will be on skin cancer, followed by a series of other indications for use, depending on the available funding.
 
The following recent financing events have supported the Company’s execution of its development strategy:
 

● | On October 8, 2018, the Company created a new series of preferred stock, designated as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Series B Convertible Preferred”), and which consists of 5.0 million authorized shares. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | On October 10, 2018, the Company successfully completed the terms of certain Path Forward and Standstill Agreements previously entered into by and between the Company and certain debtholders (the “Path Forward Agreements”), resulting in the automatic conversion of the outstanding balance due under certain outstanding convertible secured debentures and convertible promissory notes, amounting to an aggregate of $2,253,538, into an aggregate of 302,339,252 shares of Company common stock and 2,610,453 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred at a fixed conversion price of $0.004 per share. These shares were subject to a restriction on any sales below $0.02 through December 31, 2018 and will have volume limitations on any sales below $0.01 during the first six months of 2019. 
● | On October 10, 2018 the Company consummated a private placement transaction, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $738,140. In addition, the Company issued an aggregate of 287,168,409 shares of its common stock, 695,302 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred, and warrants to purchase that number of shares of common stock equal to 50% of the shares of common stock issued in the private placement valued at $3,352,068 from the exchange of notes, past due executive compensation, and certain other liabilities. All shares issued in the private placement are restricted securities. The warrants have a two-year term and are exercisable at a price of $0.01 per share.

Based on the Company’s financial history since inception, its auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has limited revenue, nominal cash, and has accumulated deficits since inception. If the Company cannot obtain sufficient additional capital, the Company will be required to delay the execution of its business strategy and may not be able to continue operations. Although management believes that it will be able to secure necessary working capital to fund its development programs and execute its business strategy, no assurances can be given.
 
Product Features
 
The Company’s RadioGel™ device has the following product features:
 

● | Beta particles only travel a short distance so the device can deliver high radiation to the tumor with minimal dose to the nearby normal tissues. In medical terms Y-90 beta emitter has a high efficacy rate; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Benefitting from the short penetration distance, the patient can go home immediately with no fear of exposure to family members, and there is a greatly reduced radiation risk to the doctor. A simple plastic tube around the syringe, gloves and safety glasses are all that is required. Other gamma emitting products require much more protection; 
● | A 2.7-day half-life means that only 5% of the radiation remains after ten days. This is in contrast to the industry-standard gamma irradiation product, which has a half-life of 17 days; 
● | The short half-life also means that any medical waste can be stored for thirty days then disposed as normal hospital waste; 
● | RadioGel™ can be administered with small diameter needles (27-gauge) so there is minimal damage to the normal tissue. This is in contrast to the injection of metal seeds, which does considerable damage; and 
● | After about 120 days the gel resorbs by a normal biological cycle, called the Krebs Cycle. The only remaining evidence of the treatment are phosphate particles so small in diameter that it requires a high-resolution microscope to find them. This is in contrast to permanent presence of metal seeds. 



Steps from Production to Therapy
 
Device Production
 
During the next two years, the Company intends to outsource material aspects of manufacturing and distribution. As future product volume increases, the Company will reassess its make-buy decision on manufacturing and will analyze the cost/benefit of a centrally located facility.
 
Production of the Hydrogel
 
RadioGel™ is manufactured with a proprietary process under ventilated sterile hood by following strict Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) procedures. It is made in large batches that are frozen for up to three months. When the product is ready to ship, a small quantity of the gel is dissolved in a sterile saline solution. It is then passed through an ultra-fine filter to ensure sterility.
 
Production of the Yttrium-90 Phosphate Particles
 
The Y-90 particles are produced with simple ingredients via a proprietary process, again following strict GLP procedures. They are then mixed into a phosphate-buffered saline solution. They can be produced in large batches for several shipments. The number of particles per shipment is determined by the dose prescribed by the doctor.

---

Shipment
 
RadioGel™ is shipped in two containers, one with a solution of the gel and the other with a solution of the particles. Before shipment they are subjected to sterility testing, again by strict procedures. The vial with the Y-90 is put through a special radiation calibrator, which measures beta particles. The vials can be shipped via FedEx or UPS by following the proper protocols.
At the User
 
The user receives the two vials. The solution containing the RadioGel™ is mixed with the solution containing the Y-90 particles. This is then shaken to ensure homogeneity and withdrawn into a syringe. The quantities that are mixed are calculated from the information on the product label.
 
The specific injection technique depends on the Indication for Use. For small tumors, one centimeter in diameter or less, the cancer is treated with a single injection. For larger tumors, the cancer is treated with a series of small injections from the same syringe or multiple syringes.
 
Principal Markets
 
The Company is currently pursuing two synergistic business sectors, medical and veterinary, each of which are summarized below.
 
Medical Sector
 
RadioGel™ is currently fully developed, requiring only FDA approval before commercialization. The Company has been seeking FDA approval of RadioGel™ for almost five years. Recent progress has been delayed due to a lack of adequate funding. The principal issue preventing approval is that the Company attempted to obtain regulatory approval for a broad range of Indications for Use, including all non-resectable cancers, without sufficient supporting data.
 
Building on the FDA’s ruling of RadioGel™ as a device, the Company is currently developing test plans to address issues raised in the Company’s prior FDA submittal regarding RadioGel™. The Company intends to request FDA approval to submit RadioGel™ for de novo classification, which would reclassify the device from a Class III device to a Class II device and accelerate the regulatory approval path.
 
After analyzing the Company’s data and the last five years of communication from the FDA, the Company has taken the following steps:
 

1. | Under new leadership, the Company is implementing all past recommendations from the FDA. The Company intends to narrow the Indications for Use, will provide test plans for FDA review to respond to answer all previous FDA questions, and will request a pre-submission meeting; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Prepare a pre-submission request document and FDA meeting request to obtain feedback on the test plans in order to initiate testing, to present the proposed content for the final application and to request permission to submit a de novo; 
3. | Submit an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) to obtain permission to conduct human clinical studies; and 
4. | File a de novo or Pre-Market Approval application. 

 
The critical path is the required testing – in vitro, animal testing, human clinical studies – all of which is resource dependent.
 

-5-
---


In previous submittals, the Company proposed applying a very broad range of cancer therapies, referred to as Indications for Use, to RadioGel™. The FDA has strongly advised the Company to reduce its Indications for Use. To comply with that request, the Company has expanded its MAB, consisting of Drs. Barry D. Pressman (Chairman), Albert DeNittis, and Howard Sandler.
 
The MAB evaluated the candidate cancer therapies based on three criteria: (i) the potential for FDA approval and successful therapy; (ii) notable advantages of RadioGel™ over current therapies; and (iii) the likelihood that RadioGel™ can be widely accepted by the medical community and profitably commercialized.
 
The MAB selected eighteen Indications for Use for RadioGel™, each of which meets the above-mentioned criteria. These eighteen Indications for Use are listed below. This large number confirms the wide applicability of the device and defines the path for future growth. The Company intends to apply to the FDA for a single Indication for Use, followed by subsequent applications for additional Indications for Use. The initial application should facilitate each subsequent application, and the testing for many of the subsequent applications could be conducted in parallel, depending on available resources.
 

● | Skin cancer | ● | Non-dendritic brain 
--+------------------------------------------------------------+---+--------------------------------------
● | Involved lymph nodes | ● | Pediatric cancers – several types 
● | Bladder | ● | Rectal 
● | Liver | ● | Gynecological 
● | Localized prostate | ● | Spinal 
● | Pancreas | ● | Recurrent esophageal 
● | Head and neck (including sino-nasal and oropharyngeal) | ● | Breast cancer resection cavity 
● | Ocular melanoma | ● | Anaplastic thyroid 

 
After thorough review to prioritize indications, the MAB has selected basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma (skin cancers) as the first Indication for Use to be presented to the FDA. According to American Cancer Society, one out of every three new cancers diagnosed in the U.S. is a cancerous skin lesion of this type, representing 5.5 million tumors annually. The MAB believes RadioGel™ will be the preferred treatment in a reasonable number of cases in a very large market.
 
Veterinary Sector
 
There are approximately 150 million pet dogs and cats in the United States. Nearly one-half of dogs and one-third of cats are diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. The Veterinary Oncology & Hematology Center in Norwalk, Connecticut, reports that cancer is the number one natural cause of death in older cats and dogs, accounting for nearly 50 percent of pet deaths each year. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports that half of the dogs ten years or older will die because of cancer. The National Cancer Institute reports that about six million dogs are diagnosed with cancer each year, translating to more than 16,000 a day. The average cost of treating tumors in dogs using radiation is $5,000 to $7,000, according to petcarerx.com.
 
The Company’s IsoPet® operating division focuses on the veterinary oncology market. Dr. Alice Villalobos, a founding member of the Veterinary Cancer Society and the Chair of our Veterinary Medicine Advisory Board, has been providing guidance to management regarding this market. The Veterinary Medicine Advisory Board gives us recommendations regarding the overall strategy for our animal business sector. Specially, they recommended the university veterinary hospitals for demonstration therapies, the specific cancers to be treated, and have provided business contact information to the private clinics.
 
Development of the product and application techniques and animal testing is allowed under FDA regulation. Commercial sales of RadioGelTM for animals requires confirmation by the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”). In January 2018, the Center for Veterinary Medicine Product Classification Group, the entity within the CVM that is responsible for determining the classification of a product, ruled that RadioGelTM should be classified as a device for animal therapy of feline sarcomas and canine soft tissue sarcomas.
 

-6-
---


Additionally, after a legal review, the Company believes that the device classification obtained from the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine is not limited to canine and feline sarcomas, but rather may be extended to a much broader population of veterinary cancers, including all or most all solid tumors in animals. We expect the result of such classification and label approval will be that no additional regulatory approvals are necessary for the use of RadioGelTM for the treatment of solid tumors in animals. The FDA does not have premarket authority over devices with a veterinary classification, and the manufacturers are responsible for assuring that the product is safe, effective, properly labeled, and otherwise in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
 
The Company currently intends to utilize university veterinary hospitals for therapy development, given that veterinary hospitals offer superior and plentiful veterinarians and students, a large number of animal patients, radioactive material handling licenses, and are respected by private veterinary centers and hospitals.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the grant with Washington State University, it was responsible for conducting studies regarding in vivo dosimetry and toxicity of intralesional Y-90 phosphate nanoparticles for the treatment of spontaneous feline and canine sarcomas. The term of the grant was October 1, 2016 through January 31, 2018. The Company provided the university with the RadioGelTM required to complete the studies, as well as technical support for dosimetry calculations. All payments provided to Washington State University in relation to the grant were made by Washington State Life Sciences Discovery Fund pursuant to a grant, and were not paid by the Company. To compliment the grant, additional scope was added to explore the option of pre-mixing the vials prior to shipment and the Company was reimbursed $17,583 as a separate contract to the grant.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the contract with the University of Missouri, it was responsible for conducting studies regarding in vivo dosimetry and toxicity of intralesional Y-90 phosphate nanoparticles for the treatment of soft tissue carcinoma and equine sarcoids. The term of the contract was initially from November 1, 2017 through October 31, 2018, but it has recently been working to extend this contract through testing completion on canine soft tissue sarcoma and equine sarcoids, plus additional tumors of interest defined by the University of Missouri principal investigators. This extension is dependent upon keeping current with paying for the expenses of the ongoing therapies.
 
Competitors
 
The Company competes in a market characterized by technological innovation, extensive research efforts, and significant competition.
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological changes. A number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products that target the same diseases and conditions that our products target. We cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of potentially competitive products or their possible effect on our sales. Certain potentially competitive products to our products may be in various stages of development. Also, there may be many ongoing studies with currently marketed products and other developmental products, which may yield new data that could adversely impact the use of our products in their current and potential future Indications for Use. The introduction of competitive products could significantly reduce our sales, which, in turn would adversely impact our financial and operating results.
 
There are a wide variety of cancer treatments approved and marketed in the U.S. and globally. General categories of treatment include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. These products have a diverse set of success rates and side effects. The Company’s products, including RadioGel™, fall into the brachytherapy treatment category. There are a number of brachytherapy devices currently marketed in the U.S. and globally. The traditional iodine-125 (I-125) and palladium-103 (Pd-103) technologies for brachytherapy are well entrenched with powerful market players controlling the market. The industry-standard I-125-based therapy was developed by Oncura, which is a unit of General Electric Company. Additionally, C.R. Bard, a major industry player competes in the I-125 brachytherapy marketplace. These market competitors are also involved in the distribution of Pd-103 based products. Cs-131 brachytherapy products are sold by IsoRay. Several Y-90 therapies have been FDA approved including SIR-Spheres by Sirtex, TheraSphere by Biocompatibles UK and Zevalin by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals.

Raw Materials
 
The Company currently subcontracts the manufacturing of RadioGelTM at IsoTherapeutics. PerkinElmer Inc., the only supplier of Y-90 in the United States, is the sole supplier of the Y-90 used by IsoTherapeutics to manufacture the Company’s RadioGel™. The Company obtains supplies, hardware, handling equipment and packaging from several different U.S. suppliers.
Customers
 
The Company anticipates that potential customers for our potential brachytherapy products likely would include those institutions and individuals that currently purchase brachytherapy products or other oncology treatment products.
Government Regulation
 
The Company’s present and future intended activities in the development, manufacturing and sale of cancer therapy products, including RadioGel™, are subject to extensive laws, regulations, regulatory approvals and guidelines. Within the United States, the Company’s therapeutic radiological devices must comply with the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which is enforced by FDA. The Company is also required to adhere to applicable FDA Quality System Regulations, also known as the Good Manufacturing Practices, which include extensive record keeping and periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities.
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates, among other things, new product clearances and approvals to establish the safety and efficacy of these products. We are also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Environmental Protection Act.
 
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, distribution, use, reporting, advertising and promotion of such products. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in civil penalties, recall, injunction or seizure of products, refusal of the government to approve or clear product approval applications, disqualification from sponsoring or conducting clinical investigations, preventing us from entering into government supply contracts, withdrawal of previously approved applications, and criminal prosecution.
 
In the United States, medical devices are classified into three different categories over which the FDA applies increasing levels of regulation: Class I, Class II, and Class III. Most Class I devices are exempt from premarket notification 510(k); most Class II devices require premarket notification 510(k); and most Class III devices require premarket approval. RadioGel™ is currently classified as a Class III device.
 
Approval of new Class III medical devices is a lengthy procedure and can take a number of years and require the expenditure of significant resources. There is a shorter FDA review and clearance process for Class II medical devices, the premarket notification or 510(k) process, whereby a company can market certain Class II medical devices that can be shown to be substantially equivalent to other legally marketed devices.
 
The Company intends to apply for a de novo with an anticipated expenditure of $10.0 million over the next four years.

As a registered medical device manufacturer with the FDA, we are subject to inspection to ensure compliance with FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. These regulations require that we and any of our contract manufacturers design, manufacture and service products, and maintain documents in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing, distribution, storage, design control, and service activities. Modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of a device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device require a new 510(k) premarket notification for any significant product modification.

The Medical Device Reporting regulation requires that we provide information to the FDA on deaths or serious injuries alleged to be associated with the use of our devices, as well as product malfunctions that are likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. Labeling and promotional activities are regulated by the FDA and, in some circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission.
 
As a medical device manufacturer, we are also subject to laws and regulations administered by governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels. For example, our facility is licensed as a medical device manufacturing facility in the State of Washington and is subject to periodic state regulatory inspections. Our customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us.
 
In the United States, as a manufacturer of medical devices and devices utilizing radioactive byproduct material, we are subject to extensive regulation by not only federal governmental authorities, such as the FDA and FAA, but also by state and local governmental authorities, such as the Washington State Department of Health, to ensure such devices are safe and effective. In Washington State, the Department of Health, by agreement with the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”), regulates the possession, use, and disposal of radioactive byproduct material as well as the manufacture of radioactive sealed sources to ensure compliance with state and federal laws and regulations. RadioGel™ constitutes both medical devices and radioactive sealed sources and are subject to these regulations.
 
Moreover, our use, management, and disposal of certain radioactive substances and wastes are subject to regulation by several federal and state agencies depending on the nature of the substance or waste material. We believe that we are in compliance with all federal and state regulations for this purpose.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
Our business does not require us to comply with any extraordinary environmental regulations. Our RadioGel™ product is manufactured in an independently owned and operated facility. Any environmental effects or contamination event that could result would be from the shipping company during shipment and misuse by the treatment facility upon arrival.
