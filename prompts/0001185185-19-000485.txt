Item 1. Business
Our Company
 
Nova LifeStyle, Inc. (“Nova LifeStyle” or the “Company”) is a U.S.-based innovative designer and marketer of contemporary styled residential and commercial furniture formerly known as Stevens Resources, Inc., we were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 9, 2009. The Company’s products are marketed through wholesale and retail channels as well as various online platforms worldwide.
 
Nova LifeStyle’s family of brands includes Diamond Sofa (www.diamondsofa.com) and Bright Swallow.
 
Our business strength lies in our abilities to quickly adapt to changing marker demand and stay ahead of the latest trends in modern furniture designs. Our customers principally consist of designers, distributors and retailers who cater to mid-level and high end private label home furnishings that have little product overlap within our specific furnishings products or product lines.  Nova LifeStyle is constantly seeking to integrate new sources of distribution and manufacturing that are aligned with our growth strategies, allowing us to continually focus on growing our customer base as well as driving the expansion of our overall distribution and manufacturing relationships worldwide, providing our customers with trendy furnishing solutions.
 
We generate the majority of our sales as a branding and marketing company with vertically integrated third-party manufacturing capabilities for global furniture distributors and large national retailers. We have established long term relationships with our worldwide customers by providing them with high quality, large scale and cost-effective sourcing solutions.  Our worldwide logistics and delivery capabilities provide our customers with the flexibility to select from our extensive furniture collections tailored for their respective shipments. Our decades of experience accumulated from marketing products to international customers have enabled us to fully integrate the supply scale, product delivery logistics, marketing efficiency and design expertise to address customer demand from established markets in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia and the Middle East.  
 
Our History
 
We are a U.S. holding company that operates through several wholly-owned subsidiaries. We design and market residential and commercial furniture products worldwide. Our subsidiaries include Nova Furniture Limited in the British Virgin Islands (“Nova Furniture”), Nova Furniture Limited in Samoa (“Nova Samoa”), Nova Furniture Macao Commercial Offshore Limited (“Nova Macao”), Bright Swallow International Group Limited (“Bright Swallow”), Diamond Bar Outdoors, Inc. (“Diamond Bar”), and i Design Blockchain Technology, Inc (“i Design”). Nova Macao was organized under the laws of Macao on May 20, 2006. Nova Macao is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nova Furniture.  Diamond Bar is a California corporation organized on June 15, 2000, which we acquired pursuant to a stock purchase agreement on August 31, 2011.  On April 24, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Bright Swallow which was fully paid at the closing of the acquisition. 
 
On October 24, 2013, Nova Furniture (Dongguan) Co., Ltd. (“Nova Dongguan”) incorporated Dongguan Ding Nuo Household Products Co., Ltd. (“Ding Nuo”) under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) and contributed capital of RMB 1 million ($162,994). Nova Dongguan made an additional capital contribution of RMB 0.1 million ($16,305) on November 27, 2013 through one of Nova Dongguan’s officers, Mr. Gu Xing Chang, who acted as the nominee shareholder of Ding Nuo.
 
On September 23, 2016, Nova Furniture, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Seller”), entered into a Share Transfer Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Kuka Design Limited, an unrelated company incorporated in British Virgin Islands (“Kuka Design BVI” or “Buyer”). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Seller sold all of the outstanding equity interests in Nova Dongguan, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Seller, to the Buyer for a total of $8,500,000 (the “Transaction”), which such value was primarily derived from Nova Dongguan and Nova Dongguan’s wholly owned subsidiary, Nova Museum, and 90.97% owned subsidiary, Ding Nuo. Upon consummation of the Transaction on October 25, 2016, the Buyer became the sole owner of Nova Dongguan.
 
On November 10, 2016, Nova Furniture entered into a Trademark Assignment Agreement with Kuka Design BVI (“Assignee”).  Pursuant to the terms of the Trademark Assignment Agreement, Nova Furniture assigned the Assignee its full right to, and title in, the NOVA trademark in China for $6,000,000.

On December 7, 2017, Nova LifeStyle, Inc. incorporated i Design under the laws of the State of California, USA. The purpose of i Design is to build our own blockchain technology team. This new company will focus on application of blockchain technology in the furniture industry, including encouraging and facilitating interactions among designers and customers, and building blockchain-powered platform that enables designers to showcase their products including current and future furniture designs. This company is in a planning stage and has had minimum operations to date.
 
Our organizational structure is set forth in the following diagram:
 

Our Products
 
We design and market modern residential and commercial furniture in diverse markets worldwide. Our products feature urban and contemporary styles, combining comfort and functionality in matching furniture collections and upscale luxury pieces appealing to lifestyle-conscious middle and upper middle-income consumers. Many of our products are segments of multi-component furniture collections in distinctive design styles, attractively priced in the medium and upper-medium ranges. Our product lines feature upholstered, wood and metal-based furniture pieces. We classify our products by room, designation or series, such as living room, dining room, bedroom and home office series, and by category or product types such as sofas, chairs, dining tables, beds, entertainment consoles, cabinets and cupboards. Our largest selling product categories for the year ended December 31, 2018 were sofas, beds and television cabinets, which accounted for approximately 58%, 10% and 6% of sales, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our largest selling product categories were sofas, TV cabinets and beds, which accounted for approximately 54%, 16% and 10% of 2017 sales, respectively. Our products are manufactured primarily from medium-density fiberboard, or MDF board, and particleboard covered with veneers or lacquers and combined with other materials, including steel, glass, marble, leather and fabrics.

Our product offerings consist of a mix of furnishings designed by us, and sourced from third party manufacturers that are supervised under our rigorous quality control processes. Through market research, customer feedback, and ongoing design development, we identify the latest trends and customer needs in target markets to develop new products, collections and brands. Our product collections are designed to appeal to consumer preferences in specific markets. We develop both individual furniture pieces and complete furniture collections that equip an entire home which feature matching furniture suites, providing convenient home furnishing options for lifestyle-conscious consumers.
 
We generally introduce new collections and launch new design styles at international furniture exhibitions or trade fairs. Our products are displayed in our showrooms. We further support our new product launches with product brochures and online marketing campaigns. Our staff collects customer feedback and collaborates with customers worldwide to design store and showroom layouts. In marketing materials, we highlight matching furniture collections by displaying complete and fully accessorized whole-room settings instead of individual furniture pieces. We believe that such in-store presentations provide convenient, one-stop solutions to customers, and thus incentivize clients to purchase an entire room of furniture from us instead of shopping for individual pieces offered by different brands or manufacturers. Our products are designed by our own designers. Customer orders are filled by third party manufacturers under our direct quality control. We believe that our products feature superior materials, attractive appearances, superb functionalities and satisfying price points generally desired by today’s middle to upper middle-income consumers worldwide.
 
International Markets
 
We sell products to the U.S., Canadian, Chinese, Australian, European and Middle Eastern markets under the Diamond Sofa brand. We believe that discretionary purchases of furniture by middle to upper middle-income consumers will continue to increase in the furniture markets worldwide. We also believe that furniture products that feature contemporary design styles such as ours will continue to attract significant customer demand.
 
In 2018, our products were sold in 11 countries worldwide, with North America and Australia our principal international markets. Sales to North America accounted for 61.1% and 46.7% of sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales to Europe accounted for 0% and 3.3% of sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales in this region decreased as expected as we have gradually dropped low-margin products. We changed our marketing strategy by shifting revenue focus to high- margin products. Sales to Australia accounted for 12.5% and 24.3% of sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. We also expanded sales to other regions, and sales to those regions, primarily in China and other Asian countries, accounted for 26.4% and 25.7% of our total sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. As we continue to broaden our distribution network, increase direct sales and grow in the emerging markets, we believe that we are well positioned to respond to changing market conditions that will allow us to take advantage of any upturns in the global and local economies of the markets that we serve.
 
Our global logistics and delivery capabilities provide our customers with the flexibility to select from our extensive furniture collections to address their respective needs. We design and supply our products under our own brands. We also design and ship products for other major brands as their OEM designer or supplier. We offer a wide selection of stand-alone furniture pieces across a variety of product categories and approximately 30 collections developed exclusively for the international markets.   We also sell products under the Diamond Sofa brand to distributors and retailers in North America and South America and to end-user U.S. consumers through third-party shopping portals. Reflecting market demand, our research and development team works closely with customers to timely modify our existing product designs. We also offer custom-designed styles for specific market segments. In 2019, we plan to grow both online and offline sales.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales and marketing strategies target middle class, urban consumers, including: (1) direct sales to the U.S. and international customers; (2) internet sales and online marketing campaigns; and (3) participation in exhibitions and trade shows.
 
We diversify our customer base by increasing direct sales to a broad range of retailers and chain stores across the U.S. and international markets. In August 2011, we acquired Diamond Bar, a California importer and marketer of modern home furniture with market presence in North and South America. In the U.S., Diamond Bar markets its products under the “Diamond Sofa” brand to wholesale distributors and retailers.  Through Diamond Bar’s longstanding customer relationships and distribution capabilities, we plan to continue to solidify the “Diamond Sofa” brand in the U.S., Mexico and South America markets. We plan to continue to expand our direct sales and marketing efforts in North America, and in particular the U.S., which historically is the largest market worldwide for imported furniture. We intend to expand the “Diamond Sofa” brand and introduce new brands for direct sales in the U.S. and international markets while continuing to offer custom-made products under private label.

Diamond Bar also currently sells products under the Diamond Sofa brand in the U.S. through third party shopping portals, shipping orders received online directly to the end customer.  We believe that our planned direct-to-consumer online sales and marketing strategies will increase our sales in the U.S. by building our brand awareness and acting as an effective advertising vehicle. We also support new product collections and brand launches with print and online advertising campaigns, participation in furniture exhibitions and by offering product brochures and samples. We provide samples and brochures of new products for international markets to distributors and buyers, as is common in the furniture industry.
 
We have also historically expanded our market presence through strategic acquisitions. In April 2013, we acquired Bright Swallow International Group Limited (“Bright Swallow”), an established furniture company with a global client base. Bright Swallow has since become an integral part of the Nova LifeStyle family brands. Bright Swallow generated revenues of approximately $7.5 million and $7.0 million for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, and its complementary product lines as well as broad geographical reach have offered Nova LifeStyle an ideal opportunity to grow its global footprint.
 
We gain new customers by attending many international furniture trade shows throughout the year. During these events, we introduce new product offerings and launch new design collections. We believe this marketing process helps us to develop and detect the latest-trends in the marketplace, allowing us to better understand the challenges and opportunities facing distributors and buyers with whom we have long–standing customer relationships. Each year, we present new products at the International Famous Furniture Fair (3F) in Dongguan, China and the China International Furniture Exhibition in Shanghai, China. We also exhibit products under the “Diamond Sofa” brand during the Las Vegas Market (U.S.) and the High Point Market (U.S.) trade shows. Internationally, we participate in trade fairs in collaboration with our customers. We plan to expand our business in the Middle East by attending several furniture exhibitions in those markets. To highlight our latest design collections, we maintain year-round showrooms at Diamond Bar’s headquarters in California as well as the High Point Market and Las Vegas Market.
 
Suppliers and Manufacturers
 
We source finished goods from third-party manufacturers to fulfill orders placed by customers through Nova Macao and Diamond Bar for the U.S. and international markets. Our three principal suppliers of finished goods in 2018 accounted for approximately 37.5%, 33.8% and 10.5% of our total purchases in 2018, respectively.  By maintaining relationships with multiple suppliers, we benefit from a more stable supply chain and better pricing. If a change of suppliers is necessary, we believe that we can quickly fulfill our requirements from other suppliers without interruptions in order fulfillment.  We monitor our suppliers’ ability to meet our product needs and we participate in quality assurance activities to reinforce our high-quality standards. Our third-party manufacturing contracts are generally of annual or shorter durations. We issue production orders to manufacturers based on individual purchase orders. Our manufacturing relationships are non-exclusive, and we are permitted to procure products from other sources at our discretion.  None of our manufacturing contracts include production volume or purchase commitments on the part of either party. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for sourcing raw materials, agreeing to produce parts and finished products to our specifications. We hold our suppliers to high quality standards and delivery deadlines. Our quality control procedures may extend to stringent requirements for raw material suppliers.
Customers
 
Our target end customer is the middle and upper middle-income consumer of residential and commercial furniture. In the U.S. and international markets, our sales principally are to furniture distributors and retailers who in turn offer our products under their own brands or under our Diamond Sofa brand. Our three largest customers in 2018 accounted for 13.3%, 12.8% and 12.5% of our total sales in 2018, respectively. Our three largest customers in 2017 accounted for 24.3%, 13.7% and 11.5% of our total sales in 2017, respectively. No other individual customer accounted for greater than 10% of our sales in 2018 or 2017. We plan to increase direct sales to retailers and chain stores worldwide as we continue to diversify our customer base from global furniture distributors.

We are focusing on establishing and growing long-term relationships with our customers. We believe that the majority of our customers view us as a strategic long-term supplier and value the quality of our products, our timely delivery and design capabilities. We generally negotiate renewable supplier agreements with firm pricing on our products, typically for a term of one year, as is customary in the furniture industry, with individual orders made on standard purchase orders. In 2018, we sold products into approximately 11 countries worldwide, with North America and Australia as our principal international markets, while we expanded our sales in other regions. Sales to North America accounted for 61% and 47% of sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales to Australia accounted for 12% and 24% of sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change was attributed principally to our changing sales and marketing strategy to diversify international sales. Sales to other regions, primarily in Europe, China and Asia, accounted for 26% and 29% of our total sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect that a majority of our revenues will continue to come from our sales to the U.S. and international markets. We acquired Diamond Bar in August 2011, which has driven expansion of our sales to the U.S., Mexico, and South America through Diamond Bar’s longstanding customer relationships and distribution capabilities. Diamond Bar accounted for 65.8% and 51.2% of Nova Lifestyle’s total sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and Nova Macao’s revenues accounted for 25.8% and 42.3% of Nova Lifestyle’s total sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively.  In addition, we anticipate increasing internet sales under the Diamond Sofa brand through third-party shopping portals. We believe that as we expand our broad network of distributors and increase direct sales, our exposure to regional recessions will be reduced and allow us to better capitalize on emerging market trends.
 
We typically experience stronger fourth calendar quarters as our product sales are subject to the seasonality and fluctuations typical of the furniture industry. This industry-based seasonality is generally caused by shipping lead-times to international markets combined with the real estate market slowdown and decrease in furniture consumption commonly experienced during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere markets in which the majority of our customers are located and our products sell at retail. In addition, we believe that consumer demand for furniture generally reflects sensitivity to overall economic conditions, including, but not limited to, unemployment rates, housing market conditions and consumer confidence.
 
Competition
 
The furniture industry is large and highly competitive. The industry consists of many manufacturers, distributors and retailers, none of which dominates the fragmented and diverse market. Our products principally compete in the U.S., China, Europe and Australia. The primary competitive factors in these markets for our product price points and target consumers are price, quality, style, marketing, functionality and availability.
 
In the U.S. and international markets, we compete against other furniture distributors and wholesalers which are mostly located in China and other Southeast Asian countries. We also compete against traditional distributors in North America and Europe. We believe that we have significant competitive advantages over North American and European distributors due to our superb customer service and a history of prompt delivery of high quality products. Our contemporary product designs have styles and functionality that are better than, at least comparable to, those offered by our higher-priced competitors. Our design team closely coordinates with our sales and marketing staff to include customer feedback as part of their ongoing R&D improvement process, thus allows the Company to develop and timely modify products to meet the changing stylistic and functional demands from our worldwide customers. We believe that our decades of product experience and proven performance record offer competitive edges over many other suppliers. In addition to our design and logistical capabilities, we believe that our experience from sourcing custom-made products for distributors presents significant benefits to our customers. We expanded our presence in the North American market through the acquisitions of Diamond Bar in August 2011 and Bright Swallow in 2013. We have since expanded their customer base and integrated their sales channels into our growing marketing network.
 
Environmental and Regulatory Matters
 
Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations both domestically and abroad. In the U.S., federal, state and local regulations impose standards on our workplace and our relationship with the environment. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that may impact our operations. In particular, we are subject to legislation placing restrictions on our generation, emission, treatment, storage and disposal of materials, substances and wastes. Such legislation includes: the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Safe Drinking Water Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response and the Compensation and Liability Act (also known as Superfund). We are also subject to the requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, in addition to regulations concerning employee health and safety matters.  We believe the Company has complied with the relevant federal, state, local and international requirements for environmental protection.

Intellectual Property
 
We rely on the patent and trademark protection laws in the U.S. to protect our intellectual property and maintain our competitive position in the marketplace. The Company and our subsidiaries currently hold two trademarks registered in the U.S. related to the “Diamond Sofa” brand. We acquired all rights, title and interest in the two registered U.S. trademarks from St. Joyal at a price of $200,000 (which was paid in full at closing) pursuant to a trademark purchase and assignment agreement dated August 31, 2011. In addition, we have registered and maintained numerous internet domain names related to our business, including “novalifestyle.com” and “diamondsofa.com.”
Research and Development
 
We believe that new product designs are important to our continued success. We actively seek to protect our product designs and brand names under the patent and trademark protection laws in the U.S., but the copying of a product’s appearance is a common and ongoing issue in the furniture industry as manufacturers seek to capitalize on popular designs and features by copying those of their competitors and making subtle changes to avoid infringement claims. To remain competitive, we believe that we must constantly innovate to stay ahead of competitors. We have developed a design process that enables us to better manage the short product life cycles for furniture designs by anticipating and responding quickly to changing consumer preferences. We attend furniture exhibitions worldwide, conduct market research and solicit customer feedback to help us identify new trends and customer needs in our target markets. We then incorporate customer feedback into new product designs. We introduce new product collections annually for the U.S. and international markets. We anticipate introducing new products under the “Diamond Sofa” brand on a quarterly basis for the U.S. market. At least annually, we assess the marketing results for new designs in order to decide whether to continue with a particular line.
 
We use in-house designers and computer-aided modeling systems to generate design and related development work. We have used independent designers in the past for product design, from which we built prototype furniture pieces for refinement and testing. In 2018 and 2017, we invested $237,290 and $373,935, respectively, on research and development expense. We may increase future investments in R&D based on our growth strategies.
 
Furniture Industry Regulations and Standards
 
We and our products are subject to PRC, U.S. and international regulations related to the furniture industry.
 
China has a series of national standards, or the GB and QB standards, that govern certain technical, safety and quality requirements for furniture manufactured in and exported from China. The Standardization Administration of the PRC, or SAC, and the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Light Industrial Products and Art-Crafts, or the CCCLA, develop and revise these national standards relating to the structure, material, size and quality requirements for the many varied categories and classifications of upholstered, wood and metal-based furniture. Many of these standards are not compulsory, but manufacturers typically follow all applicable recommended standards.
 
Our products are also subject to the mandatory and voluntary furniture test standards of the U.S. and international markets in which our products are distributed to end consumers, including those developed by the American National Standards Institute, or ANSI, Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer’s Association, or BIFMA, ASTM International, California Air Resources Board, or CARB, Furniture Industry Research Association, or FIRA, and the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO. These environmental, ecological and formaldehyde emission standards and source of origin labeling requirements are national or international, with the U.S. and European Union typically having the strictest standards for their markets. We manufacture all products to customer specifications and we believe that our products meet all currently applicable national and international furniture test standards.
 
Export Laws and Regulations
 
We may be subject from time to time to various PRC governmental regulations related to exportation, including the Customs Law of the PRC and the Regulation of the PRC on the Administration of the Import and Export of Goods. These laws and regulations set out standards and requirements for various aspects of the export and import of goods, customs registration, sanitary registration and inspection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the confiscation of our products for export and proceeds from the sales of non-compliant products, orders for correction, fines, revocation of licenses and, in extreme cases, criminal liabilities. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable PRC laws and regulations related to the exports of our products.

Foreign Currency Regulations
 
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations promulgated by the State Council, as amended on August 5, 2008, or the Foreign Exchange Regulations. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, the RMB, the national currency of the PRC, is freely convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investments, loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China, unless the prior approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or the SAFE, is obtained and prior registration with the SAFE is made.
 
On July 4, 2014, the SAFE issued Circular 37, the Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Corporate Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles, which became effective as of July 4, 2014. Please refer to “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Business in China – PRC regulations relating to the registration requirements for PRC resident shareholders owning shares in offshore companies may subject our PRC resident shareholders to personal liability and adversely affect our business” for a discussion of Circular 37.
 
On August 29, 2008, the SAFE promulgated Circular 142, the Notice on Perfecting Practices Concerning Foreign Exchange Settlement Regarding the Capital Contribution by Foreign-invested Enterprises, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested company of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 33 full time employees worldwide.  Our U.S. corporate office and operations employed 30 full-time employees and our locations in Macau and Hong Kong employed a total of 3 full-time employees. We believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees.
