Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
We are a leading comfort innovation company with a vision to design and manufacture consumer products to improve how people live. We offer a range of mattress, bedding and cushioning products. Our products are the result of over 20 years of innovation and investment in proprietary and patented comfort technologies and the development of our own manufacturing processes. Our Hyper-Elastic Polymer® technology underpins many of our comfort products and provides a range of benefits that differentiate our offerings from other competitors’ products. We sell our products through a direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) distribution model as well as through wholesale partners.
 
The foundation of our business is core competencies in design, development and manufacturing, with decades of accumulated knowledge that enables us to create all aspects of our innovative products, including the fundamental comfort technologies as well as the machines and processes necessary to bring them to market. We have vertically integrated our operations to include research and development, marketing and manufacturing, resulting in an ability to rapidly test, learn, adapt and scale our product offerings. In order to solve complex manufacturing challenges such as large-format Hyper-Elastic Polymer® molding (required to make our mattresses), we designed and produced our own manufacturing equipment including our proprietary and patented Mattress Max™ machinery. Our combination of patents and intellectual property, proprietary and patented manufacturing equipment, production processes and decades of acquired knowledge create an advantage over our competitors who rely on commoditized technologies and outsourced manufacturing.
 
We have not only developed transformative products and technologies, but also a brand that has high customer engagement and avid online advocates. We have an experienced digital marketing team that has generated digital marketing content that enables efficient customer acquisition and builds brand affinity. Our digital marketing strategy enables us to market our full product suite to customers and drive frequent interactions online.
 
We have been able to capitalize on the DTC macro trend that is transforming the bedding industry. In addition to our DTC channel, we have developed multiple wholesale relationships with established vendors such as Mattress Firm, Macy’s, Bed Bath & Beyond, Furniture Row and Samsclub.com. We believe that our distinctly differentiated products, marketing strategies, manufacturing capabilities, unique branding and proprietary technologies position us to continue to drive Purple’s growth in comfort products. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our DTC sales channel accounted for 85% of our revenue and wholesale accounted for 15% of revenue, while sales of mattresses accounted for 83% of our revenue and other products accounted for 17%. As of December 31, 2018, we had a backlog of approximately $7.5 million.
 
Industry and Competition 
 
Our portfolio of comfort technology products are intended to improve how people spend much of their day whether they are sleeping or sitting and our addressable market is comprised of these categories.
Sleep Category
 
The sleep category encompasses a variety of products including mattresses, foundations, sheets, mattress protectors, blankets and pillows. Meaningful innovation in sleep products has been infrequent and limited over the last 150 years. The first coil spring mattress was introduced in the 1860s and it continues to remain one of the most widely adopted technologies. Over 100 years after the creation of the coil spring mattress, the memory foam-based mattress was launched in 1992. Latex, water and air mattresses also emerged during the latter part of the 20th century. Our Hyper-Elastic Polymer® technology represents a meaningful pressure relieving innovation in the mattress industry and we believe is positioned to gain significant consideration and adoption.

The market for bedding products is large, growing and undergoing fundamental transformations on account of digital marketing and DTC distribution. The U.S. mattress industry is predominantly comprised of vendors that rely on retail distribution as well as a growing number of DTC retailers. The traditional market, led by Tempur-Sealy and Serta Simmons, comprises the vast majority of the market. Products in this industry include mattresses, mattress foundations, pillows, mattress protectors, sheets and other bedding accessories. Mattresses from our competitors are typically manufactured using one or more layers of springs, standard polyurethane foam, memory foam, air chambers or latex foam. Pillows are typically manufactured using polyurethane foam, memory foam, feathers, buckwheat, latex or polyester fiber.
 
Over the past several years, growth of the DTC market exceeded that of the broader industry. DTC retailers are typically characterized by e-commerce distribution channels, more affordable pricing, free shipping and returns and limited product offerings. DTC retailers typically use foam cushioning parts that are assembled into a mattress and compressed into a box for distribution. The DTC market is highly fragmented, highly competitive and rapidly evolving. DTC competitors include, but are not limited to Casper, Leesa, Tuft & Needle, Saatva and Nectar.
 
Traditional brick-and-mortar retailers remain a significant part of the market for bedding products. This part of the retail market also is highly fragmented and competitive. The leading brick-and-mortar retailers in the United States and Canada are, respectively, Mattress Firm and Sleep Country Canada. These national retailers compete with regional and smaller retailers and retail channels such as furniture and department stores.
 
Across these channels, some key factors that impact competition in our industry include product features, reliable logistics, marketing efficiency, brand recognition and reputation, expertise of sales and after-market support, pace of innovation and product roadmap, price of products and services, and financial stability and ability to invest in innovation.
 
Sit Category
 
Our sit category consists of seating cushions that can be purchased independent of furniture. To the best of our knowledge, there are no independent market analyses that define the size and growth of this category. It is important to note that there is a significantly larger market for cushioning technology embedded within furniture including chairs and sofas as well as seats found in transportation and other categories requiring seating solutions. We believe this is a substantial market opportunity that we could pursue with either branded product offerings or through partnerships to embed our technology.

Our Products
 
Our current product portfolio is as follows:
 

● | Mattress — The roots of The Purple® Bed began in 1998 with the founders recognizing the unique benefits of Hyper-Elastic Polymer® in creating a sleep solution that is breathable to help regulate body temperature and soft enough to cradle pressure points while also providing support. The founders also realized that the ability to effectively mold a king-size bed had many challenges. After 17 years of development, which included several years of owning and operating a specialty mattress chain, our founders and their team developed machines and specialized processes that could produce up to a king-size bed at a price for the mass market. Our Hyper-Elastic Polymer® material is manufactured with non-toxic, food-contact-grade ingredients that third-party testing has shown are free from carcinogenic chemicals. We back up the quality and durability of our mattress with a 100-night comfort guarantee and a 10-year warranty. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We currently sell four distinct models of mattresses, which simultaneously provide support and cushioning, leveraging our unique Hyper-Elastic Polymer® material with collapsible columns. The result is a bed that relaxes under pressure while providing firm support. Competing mattresses are typically uniform in the level of firmness throughout the mattress and are varying degrees of soft or firm. This tradeoff is problematic as regions of the body such as the head, feet, hips and shoulders require different levels of support. Our mattresses are also temperature neutral, which is an advantage as temperature regulation is a key component of achieving optimal sleeping conditions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pillows — We sell a pillow that utilizes the Hyper-Elastic Polymer® in a head-specific triangular Smart Comfort GridTM to protect against breaking down or losing shape. We believe our pillow is unique, with no other product in the market like it in appearance, design or comfort. The pillow is designed to relax under pressure without losing support. We also sell more traditional pillows with other unique features that enable adjustment of the pillow for comfort. We back up the quality and durability of our pillows with a 100-night comfort guarantee and a one year warranty. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sheets — Our sheets and pillow cases are designed to maximize the functionality of the Hyper-Elastic Polymer® material in our mattresses and pillows. They are bamboo-based Viscose, stretchy and breathable. Recognizing that conventional sheets are often too taut to allow a mattress to correctly conform and adapt, we developed our own technology to enable customers to experience the full performance potential of our mattress (or any other mattress).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mattress Protector — Like our sheets, our mattress protector is designed to optimize the functionality of the Hyper-Elastic Polymer® material in our mattress. Our mattress protector is stretchy, breathable, protective against liquids and stain resistant.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Platform Base — Our platform base is designed for standard beds without box springs and fits all current Purple® bed sizes. Constructed from lightweight steel, our Purple™ platform is more hygienic compared to box-spring foundations and also does not squeak with motion. The platform also provides optimal support and prevents the mattress from sagging. We have strength-tested this platform at 4,800 pounds (uniform load).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Adjustable Foundation — Our Purple™ PowerBase complements our mattresses by adding electrically powered functions, such as adjustable positions, massagers with five different settings, under bed lighting and an app for smartphone control.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Seat Cushions — Our founders invented their first version of a seat cushion nearly two decades ago to solve the extreme use case of people in wheelchairs suffering from compression sores (decubitus ulcers). These exacting requirements, coupled with the unique demands of the medical equipment marketplace, such as lighter weight, safety, incontinence protection, sterility, non-toxicity and durability, became foundational to our unique product differentiation. The evolution of our portfolio of seat cushions has resulted from seven years of in-house manufacturing experience including development of proprietary machines and trade secrets. The cushions utilize Hyper-Elastic Polymer® material in our Smart Comfort Grid™ design to provide a comfortable seating experience and are designed to maximize airflow and maintain the neutral temperature of the seat. The Smart Comfort Grid™ allows our seat cushions to relax under pressure, providing pressure-releasing comfort. Our seat cushions include seven consumer models plus variants for the medical industry.

Technology
 
Technology is key to our unique position within the comfort industry. With our proprietary Hyper-Elastic Polymer® we have introduced the first major innovation to the mattress category in decades. Mattresses from our competitors are typically manufactured using one or more layers of springs, standard polyurethane foam, memory foam, air chambers or latex foam. These technologies have existed for decades and are undifferentiated from competitors within their product type.
Proprietary Technologies
 
The Purple team, through their scientific journey to get to the root causes of pressure sores, designed the Hyper-Elastic Polymer® material and other proprietary comfort technologies in order to improve the lives of millions of people. Each different cushioning product line requires unique molding techniques.
 
Our Hyper-Elastic Polymer® material is non-toxic and hypoallergenic, making it safe to use. Our Hyper-Elastic Polymer® material is durable and does not develop body impressions (compression set) from use over time. It is elastic and can stretch up to 15 times its original size and return without losing its shape. It sleeps and sits temperature neutral and has good ventilation to inhibit moisture build-up.
Proprietary Machinery
 
Internally designed, developed and built, our Mattress Max™ machines are the only machines able to mold our Hyper-Elastic Polymer® material into king-sized mattresses at scale and priced for mass adoption. We have modified our molding machines to manufacture other products containing Hyper-Elastic Polymer® such as pillows and seat cushions. The process of molding our Hyper-Elastic Polymer® material using our Mattress Max™ machinery is proprietary, patent-protected and complex, requiring specific knowledge and expertise to successfully execute manufacturing. We have a machine shop with mechanics and engineers at each of our factories to maintain these machines and our other equipment. Further, we have extensive fabrication capabilities, which enables us to design, manufacture, install and maintain new equipment as well as optimize the performance and efficiency of our machinery based on real-time insights gained from our vertically integrated operations.
Marketing
 
We have developed a brand that resonates with consumers. Our marketing efforts are focused on attracting, acquiring and retaining customers, primarily through digital campaigns and use online advertising as our main form of communication. Our campaigns are unique and memorable featuring product demonstrations that have been able to harness viral efficiencies associated with social media. As a result, we have created a brand with a loyal audience that frequently interacts with our content. This enables us to increase interaction with customers throughout replacement cycles as well as drive additional product sales across our portfolio of offerings. The success we have achieved through these social marketing campaigns has been key in our branding and awareness. Our digital marketing team has expertise across a broad range of marketing capabilities including audience segmentation, communication and targeting. We also utilize television, radio and print to create brand and product awareness.
 
We actively pursue business relationships that extend our brand reach. For example, Purple has leveraged co-branding opportunities with Disney-Pixar on multiple occasions and with well-known internet personalities. We believe these types of brand associations will further extend our brand reach.
 
Our Sales Channels
 
The majority of our sales have been through our DTC e-commerce platform; however, our wholesale channel has been growing rapidly. We have relationships with a growing number of brick-and-mortar retailers and are expanding our national footprint of retail partners that sell our products.

Direct-to-Consumer Channel
 
E-commerce is our primary distribution channel. We have benefitted from the rapid growth of the DTC mattress industry in addition to our differentiated product offering and unique marketing campaigns. We expect the DTC mattress industry to continue to grow as consumer confidence in online shopping increases. We sell directly to consumers through our website, purple.com. We help customers easily engage in relevant content, research our solutions, transact online and find support. We believe our online experience expands our brand and connections with consumers, enabling deeper awareness, engagement and brand loyalty. We believe that our 100-night trial along with free shipping and free returns provides confidence to consumers to buy a mattress before trying.
 
Wholesale Channel
 
We sell our assortment of products through brick-and-mortar wholesale partners. We began selling seat cushions to wholesale partners in 2010 and began selling mattresses and bedding products through our largest wholesale partner, Mattress Firm, in November 2017. We have expanded the number of retail doors where our mattresses and bedding products are sold throughout 2018, and now sell mattresses through Mattress Firm, Furniture Row, Macy’s, Samsclub.com, and Bed Bath and Beyond. We anticipate continuing to expand our national footprint of brick-and-mortar wholesale partners that sell our products such that our consumers will be within a reasonable distance to drive if they desire to experience one of our mattresses before purchasing.
Medical Industry Sales
 
We sell a line of seat cushions through a global network of medical device distributors. At this time, one of our cushion models is a registered medical device in the U.S. and the other models are sold as comfort cushions or for wound risk mitigation rather than as medical devices. We do not deal directly with insurance or Medicare and do not expect to in the future. While medical channels do not yet represent a significant percentage of our sales, we believe there is opportunity for growth.
 
Company-Owned Stores
 
We operate one retail store at our Alpine, Utah facility where consumers can experience and purchase our products and expect this store to remain in operation for the foreseeable future. Also, we anticipate exploring opportunities to open our own Company retail stores in strategic locations in 2019.
 
Operations
 
Factories, Supply Chain and Manufacturing
 
We operate factories in Alpine, Utah and Grantsville, Utah, which manufacture and distribute Purple® products. These factories have a total of 667,000 square-feet (15 acres under roof), including approximately 574,000 square-feet at our Grantsville, Utah facility and approximately 93,000 square-feet at our Alpine, Utah facility comprised of two buildings. We believe that these facilities will provide ample room to accommodate our future growth and expansion plans. At these factories we manufacture our proprietary Hyper-Elastic Polymer® material used in our mattress, pillow and seat cushion products. We assemble, package and ship our products from these facilities.
 
We outsource and resell other products, including power bases, platform bases, sheets, mattress protectors, and blankets.
 
We have relationships with, or have identified, multiple suppliers for our outsourced products and components. These suppliers may be freely interchanged in order to maintain quality, cost and delivery expectations.

Our History
 
Tony and Terry Pearce have over a twenty-five year history of developing innovative comfort technologies, machines and products. In 1989, the Pearce brothers created a partnership to develop high-tech carbon fiber sporting goods and wheelchairs. In the course of developing and testing wheelchair products, it was clear to the founding team that the core issue of wheelchair comfort could only be solved if the extreme case of compression sores was solved. This led them on a scientific journey to discover the root causes of pressure sores and how to mitigate this condition.
 
In 2010, our founders launched what has become our current vertically integrated company. The first products sold were seat cushions. In 2013 we attempted to develop a king-size mattress using our improved Hyper-Elastic Polymer® material. The principal setback in developing king-size mattresses was that the entire surface of the mattress could not be covered using a single piece of Hyper-Elastic Polymer® material. Over the years and with substantial investment the team overcame this obstacle by creating the proprietary Mattress Max™ machine. We began selling our Purple brand of mattresses with a small test in late 2015 and at scale beginning in January 2016. Purple Innovation, LLC, based in Alpine, Utah, was organized as a Delaware limited liability company on May 26, 2010 under the name WonderGel, LLC. We changed our name to Purple Innovation, LLC on January 27, 2017.
 
On February 2, 2018, we consummated a reverse recapitalization (the “Business Combination”) pursuant to which we acquired a portion of the equity of Purple LLC. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization because the former owners of Purple LLC have control over the combined company through their 82% ownership of the common stock of the Company. Although the Company was the legal acquirer, the historical operations of Purple LLC are deemed to be those of the Company.
