ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.

OVERVIEW
Remark Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (“Remark”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), which include its consolidated variable-interest entities (“VIEs”), are primarily technology-focused. Our KanKan data intelligence platform serves as the basis for our development and deployment of artificial-intelligence-based solutions for businesses in many industries and geographies. We also own and operate digital media properties across multiple verticals, such as travel and entertainment and young adult lifestyle, that deliver relevant, dynamic content and e-commerce solutions. Our U.S. operations are headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, and our China operations are headquartered in Chengdu, China with additional operations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. Our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbol MARK.
OUR BUSINESS
Development
In 2009, we co-founded a U.S.-based venture, Sharecare, to build a web-based platform that simplifies the search for health and wellness information. The other co-founders of Sharecare were Dr. Mehmet Oz, HARPO Productions, Discovery Communications, Jeff Arnold and Sony Pictures Television. As a part of the transactions, we received an equity stake in Sharecare, which constitutes approximately five percent of Sharecare’s issued capital stock at December 31, 2018. We also maintain representation on Sharecare’s Board of Directors.
In March 2013, we entered the young adult lifestyle vertical with the acquisition of Pop Factory, LLC, a beach lifestyle digital media brand providing website and mobile content. Later the same year, we introduced a refreshed brand and a new, mobile-optimized website at www.bikini.com, which includes e-commerce.
We transitioned in 2015 from being a strictly content-based company to a technology company. We leverage KanKan, our data intelligence platform, to deliver an integrated suite of AI solutions that enable businesses and organization to solve problems, reduce risk and deliver positive outcomes. The easy-to-install AI products are being rolled out in a wide range of applications within the retail, financial, public safety and workplace arenas.
In September 2015, we acquired (the “VDC Acquisition”) Vegas.com LLC (“Vegas.com” or “VDC”) to give us a deeper reach into the travel and entertainment market in Las Vegas and the surrounding area. Vegas.com is a well-established brand and, through websites and mobile applications that it controls, it allows users to book travel to, and lodging and entertainment in, the Las-Vegas-area market. In March 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell Vegas.com to an affiliate of our lenders (the “VDC Transaction”; see Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information), which transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2019.
In September 2016, we completed the acquisition (the “CBG Acquisition”) of assets of China Branding Group Limited (“CBG”), pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Asset and Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of the same date (the “CBG Purchase Agreement”), with CBG and the other parties specified therein. During 2018, we re-branded the assets that are now referred to as Remark Entertainment (formerly referred to as our Fanstang business).
In the foreseeable future, we will continue to focus primarily on developing and monetizing new AI-based products and services using our KanKan data intelligence platform and deploying such products and services in the vast Asia market across multiple industries. Additionally, we have begun marketing activities in Europe and the US and we will continue such activities.

Business Model
We currently earn a majority of our revenue from sales of various travel and entertainment products (including lodging, air travel, show tickets and tours) booked through our travel and entertainment segment, consisting of Vegas.com and its related websites (including LasVegas.com), mobile applications and retail locations.
We also recognize revenue from the following sources:

• | sales of AI-based products and services from our KanKan business


• | sales of financial-technology (“FinTech”) products and services from our KanKan business


• | various advertising mechanisms associated with our websites

Excluding general and administrative expense, the primary costs we incur to earn the revenue described above include:

• | credit card fees


• | costs related to providing tours, such as permits, fees, fuel, vehicle leases and vehicle repair


• | software and website development costs, including licensing costs for third-party software


• | data acquisition and customer acquisition costs


• | cost of equipment related to customized AI products


• | costs associated with marketing our brands

Travel and Entertainment
Vegas.com comprises our travel and entertainment business. We believe that Vegas.com is the premiere online booking service for all of the exciting travel and entertainment opportunities related to Las Vegas and the immediately-surrounding areas. Vegas.com offers users the ability to book lodging, air travel, show tickets and tours, and its customer service team is staffed by Las Vegas locals who are intimately familiar with Las Vegas and the various products and services offered through the website. As previously noted, in March 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell Vegas.com to an affiliate of our lenders, which transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2019.
Technology and Data Intelligence
Our KanKan business comprises our Technology & Data Intelligence business. KanKan generates our data platform services revenue by developing and deploying artificial intelligence (“AI”) products and AI-based solutions for businesses in many industries and geographies, as well as by providing financial technology (“FinTech”) products and services. Though we currently focus our KanKan business on the Asia-Pacific region, we have initiated marketing activities in Europe and the United States and are launching several proof-of-concept projects. 
We have been developing AI-based vision products, computing devices and software-as-a-service products that we are launching across a wide range of applications within the financial, retail, entertainment, education, and workplace and public safety industries. We constantly improve our KanKan data and AI platform with advanced data, algorithms and training; our facial-recognition algorithms recently received top rankings in Labeled Faces in the Wild (hosted by the University of Massachusetts) and MegaFace (hosted by the University of Washington), two widely-recognized global facial-recognition testing platforms. Among the other work that we have ramped up during 2018, we continue partnering with top universities on research projects targeting algorithm, artificial neural network and computing architectures, which we believe keeps us among the leaders in technology development.

Other Digital Media Assets
Young Adult Lifestyle
Bikini.com is our e-commerce website selling swimwear and accessories in the latest styles, which we currently intend to promote primarily on a subscription basis in the future.
Competition
We compete for business primarily in the online travel and entertainment booking marketplace and in the FinTech and AI marketplaces, each of which are intensely competitive and, with regard to the FinTech and AI marketplaces, rapidly evolving.
Travel and Entertainment
 The primary factors upon which we compete are price and promotions, knowledge of the Las Vegas area, customer service and the quality and features of our sales channels. We believe the following are our primary competitors:

• | online travel reservation services such as The Priceline Group (priceline.com, booking.com), Expedia (expedia.com, hotels.com, hotwire.com, travelocity.com, orbitz.com), as well as websites of hotels and casinos


• | online travel search services and price comparison services such as TripAdvisor, Trivago (majority-owned by Expedia), and HotelsCombined


• | websites, such as Todtix.com, Bestofvegas.com and Showtickets.com, that sell tickets to Las Vegas-area events


• | traditional “brick-and-mortar” retailers, such as casino box offices and Tix4tonight, that sell tickets to Las Vegas-area events

We also face competition for customer traffic on Internet search engines and metasearch websites, which impacts our sales and marketing costs.
Technology and Data Intelligence
With our KanKan business, we primarily compete on the basis of the quality and reliability of our products and services. 
FinTech. The credit infrastructure in China is not yet as well developed as the credit infrastructure in the United States. We believe the traditional system underserves a large number of persons who are financially active but who do not yet have lengthy credit histories. In the FinTech market space (financial institutions and peer-to-peer lenders), we are, in essence, competing against our potential customers’ traditional systems of screening their own loan candidates.
AI-based products and services. Our AI-based products and services represent a significant opportunity for us in the future. We offer facial recognition products and we also build and deploy custom AI solutions. Our facial recognition products compete with companies such as SenseTime, Face++, Google, GoGoVan, WeLab and others, while we compete with companies such as PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Hewlett Packard, Baidu and others for business in the AI solutions market space.
Some of the companies we compete against, or may compete against in the future, may have greater brand recognition and may have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. As a result of the potentially greater brand recognition and resources, some of our competitors may bring new products and services to market more quickly, and they may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we could adopt.

Intellectual Property

We rely upon trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in various jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary assets and brands. We own two U.S. patents and one patent in each of Canada and Hong Kong, as well as several copyright registrations related to Vegas.com. Regarding our Technology and Data Intelligence segment, we own 12 copyright registrations, we have 62 patents pending in China and we have several additional patent applications we are preparing to file in China. We also hold various trademarks for our brands, and we have additional applications pending.
Technology
Our technologies include software applications built to run on third-party cloud hosting providers including Amazon Web Services and Alibaba located in North America and Asia. We make substantial use of off-the-shelf available open-source technologies such as Linux, PHP, MySQL, Drupal, mongoDB, Memcache, Apache, Nginx, CouchBase, Hadoop, HBase, ElasticSearch, Lua, Java, Redis, Akka and Wordpress, in addition to commercial platforms such as Microsoft, including Windows Operating Systems, SQL Server, and .NET. Such systems are connected to the Internet via load balancers, firewalls, and routers installed in multiple redundant pairs. We also utilize third-party services to geographically deliver data using major content distribution network providers. We rely heavily on virtualization throughout our technology architecture, which enables the scaling of dozens of digital media properties in an efficient and cost effective manner.
We use third-party cloud hosting providers to host most of our public-facing websites and applications, as well as many of our back-end business intelligence and financial systems. Each of our significant websites is designed to be fault-tolerant, with collections of application servers, typically configured in a load-balanced state, to provide additional resiliency. The infrastructure is equipped with enterprise-class security solutions to combat events such as large scale distributed denial of service attacks. Our environment is staffed and equipped with a full-scale monitoring solution.
Governmental Regulation
The services we provide are subject to various laws and regulations. We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry and the provision of travel services, including laws requiring us to register as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements. In addition, our travel business is subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation, including those relating to advertising and accessibility.
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content regulation, intellectual property, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation or other subjects. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. There are a number of legislative proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies concerning data protection that may affect us.
We post our privacy policy and practices concerning the use and disclosure of any user data on our web properties and our distribution applications. Any failure by us to comply with posted privacy policies, federal and state regulatory requirements or foreign privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings by governmental or regulatory bodies that could potentially harm our businesses, results of operations and financial condition.
Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. The Chinese government has at times taken measures to restrict digital platforms, publishers or specific content themes from consumption by its citizens. We invest significant efforts into ensuring that our published content in China is consistent with our most current understanding of prevailing Chinese laws, regulations, and policies; and to date our published content in China has been met with successful distribution and no action or inquiry from the Chinese government. However, unforeseen regulatory restrictions or policy changes in China regarding digital content could have a material adverse effect on our business.

The Chinese government has not yet adopted a clear regulatory framework governing the new and rapidly-evolving artificial intelligence industry in which we operate. The Chinese government’s adoption of more stringent laws or enforcement protocols affecting participants in such industries (including, without limitation, restrictions on foreign investment, capital requirements and licensing requirements) could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Corporate Structure
To comply with China’s laws which restrict foreign ownership of entities that operate within industries deemed sensitive by the Chinese government, we employ what we believe is a commonly-used organizational structure consisting of a wholly-foreign owned enterprise (“WFOE”) and VIEs to operate our KanKan business. We own 100% of the equity of the WFOE, while the VIEs are companies formed in China under local laws which are owned by members of our management team. We funded the registered capital and operating expenses of the VIEs by extending loans to the VIEs’ owners. We believe that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIEs because the equity holders of such entities do not have significant equity at risk and because we have been able to direct the operations of the VIEs.
The following diagram illustrates our China holding structure as of the date of this 2018 Form 10-K. The diagram omits certain entities which are immaterial to our results of operations and financial condition. Equity interests depicted in this diagram are 100% owned. The relationships between each of Chengdu Remark Technology Co., Ltd.; Hangzhou Shufeng Technology Co., Ltd.; Remark Data Technology Co., Ltd. and BoNet (Beijing) Technology LLC, on the one hand, and KanKan Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., on the other hand, as illustrated in the following diagram are governed by contractual arrangements, including in each case an Exclusive Call Option Agreement, an Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement, a Proxy Agreement and an Equity Pledge Agreement, and do not constitute equity ownership.
