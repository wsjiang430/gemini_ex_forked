Item 1.   Business:
General
 
     The Company, founded in 1946, operated 1,311 fashion specialty stores at February 2, 2019, in 31 states, principally in the southeastern United States, under the names “Cato,” “Cato Fashions,” “Cato Plus,” “It’s Fashion,” “It’s Fashion Metro” and “Versona.”  The Cato concept seeks to offer quality fashion apparel and accessories at low prices, every day in junior/missy and plus sizes. The Cato concept’s stores and e-commerce websites feature a broad assortment of apparel and accessories, including dressy, career, and casual sportswear, dresses, coats, shoes, lingerie, costume jewelry and handbags. A major portion of the Cato concept’s merchandise is sold under its private label and is produced by various vendors in accordance with the concept’s specifications.  The It’s Fashion and It’s Fashion Metro concepts offer fashion with a focus on the latest trendy styles for the entire family at low prices every day.  The Versona concept’s stores and e-commerce website offer quality fashion apparel items, jewelry and accessories at exceptional values every day.  The Company’s stores range in size from 2,100 to 19,000 square feet and are located primarily in strip shopping centers anchored by national discounters or market-dominant grocery stores.  The Company emphasizes friendly customer service and coordinated merchandise presentations in an appealing store environment. The Company offers its own credit card and layaway plan. Credit and layaway sales under the Company’s plan represented 7% of retail sales in fiscal 2018. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Reportable Segment Information,” for a discussion of information regarding the Company’s two reportable segments: retail and credit.  
Business
 
     The Company’s primary objective is to be the leading fashion specialty retailer for fashion and value in its markets. Management believes the Company’s success is dependent upon its ability to differentiate its stores from department stores, mass merchandise discount stores and competing specialty stores. The key elements of the Company’s business strategy are:
 
     Merchandise Assortment.  The Company’s stores offer a wide assortment of on-trend apparel and accessory items in primarily junior/missy, plus sizes, mens and kids sizes, infant to boys size 20 and girls size 16 with an emphasis on color, product coordination and selection.  Colors and styles are coordinated and presented so that outfit selection is easily made.
 
     Value Pricing.  The Company offers quality merchandise that is generally priced below comparable merchandise offered by department stores and mall specialty apparel chains, but is generally more fashionable than merchandise offered by discount stores. Management believes that the Company has positioned itself as the every day low price leader in its market segment.
 
    Strip Shopping Center Locations. The Company locates its stores principally in convenient strip centers anchored by national discounters or market-dominant grocery stores that attract large numbers of potential customers.
 
     Customer Service.  Store managers and sales associates are trained to provide prompt and courteous service and to assist customers in merchandise selection and wardrobe coordination.
 
     Credit and Layaway Programs.  The Company offers its own credit card and a layaway plan to make the purchase of its merchandise more convenient for its customers.

 Merchandising
 
  Merchandising
 
    The Company seeks to offer a broad selection of high quality and exceptional value apparel and accessories to suit the various lifestyles of fashion and value-conscious customers. In addition, the Company strives to offer on-trend fashion in exciting colors with consistent fit and quality.
 
     The Company’s merchandise lines include dressy, career, and casual sportswear, dresses, coats, shoes, lingerie, costume jewelry, handbags, men’s wear and lines for kids and infants. The Company primarily offers exclusive merchandise with fashion and quality comparable to mall specialty stores at low prices, every day.
 
      The Company believes that the collaboration of its merchandising and design teams with an expanded in-house product development and direct sourcing function has enhanced merchandise offerings and delivers quality, exclusive on-trend styles at lower prices. The product development and direct sourcing operations provide research on emerging fashion and color trends, technical services and direct sourcing options.
 
      As a part of its merchandising strategy, members of the Company’s merchandising and design staff frequently attend trade shows to stay abreast of latest trends and styles, visit selected stores to monitor the merchandise offerings of other retailers, regularly communicate with store operations associates and frequently confer with key vendors.  The Company also takes aggressive markdowns on slow-selling merchandise and typically does not carry over merchandise to the next season.
 
  Purchasing, Allocation and Distribution
 
      Although the Company purchases merchandise from approximately 531 suppliers, most of its merchandise is purchased from approximately 100 primary vendors. In fiscal 2018, purchases from the Company’s largest vendor accounted for approximately 7% of the Company’s total purchases. The Company is not dependent on its largest vendor or any other vendor for merchandise purchases, and the loss of any single vendor or group of vendors would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results or financial condition. A substantial portion of the Company’s merchandise is sold under its private labels and is produced by various vendors in accordance with the Company’s strict specifications. The Company sources a majority of its merchandise directly from manufacturers overseas. The Company purchases its remaining merchandise from domestic importers and vendors, which typically minimizes the time necessary to purchase and obtain shipments.  The Company opened its own overseas sourcing operations in the fall of 2014, replacing the Company’s former sourcing agent in 2015. Although a significant portion of the Company’s merchandise is manufactured overseas, the Company does not expect that any economic, political or social unrest in any one country would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to obtain adequate supplies of merchandise.  However, the Company can give no assurance that any changes or disruptions in its merchandise supply chain would not materially and adversely affect the Company.  See “Risk Factors – Risks Relating To Our Business – Because we source a significant portion of our merchandise directly and indirectly from overseas, we are subject to risks associated with international operations; changes, disruptions, cost changes or other problems affecting the Company’s merchandise supply chain could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.”  
 
      An important component of the Company’s strategy is the allocation of merchandise to individual stores based on an analysis of sales trends by merchandise category, customer profiles and climatic conditions. A merchandise control system provides current information on the sales activity of each merchandise style in each of the Company’s stores. Point-of-sale terminals in the stores collect and transmit sales and inventory information to the Company’s central database, permitting timely response to sales trends on a store-by-store basis.

      All merchandise is shipped directly to the Company’s distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina, where it is inspected and then allocated by the merchandise distribution staff for shipment to individual stores. The flow of merchandise from receipt at the distribution center to shipment to stores is controlled by an on-line system. Shipments are made by common carrier, and each store receives at least one shipment per week.  The centralization of the Company’s distribution process also subjects it to risks in the event of damage to or destruction of its distribution facility or other disruptions affecting the distribution center or the flow of goods into or out of Charlotte, North Carolina.  See “Risk Factors – Risks Relating To Our Business – A disruption or shutdown of our centralized distribution center or transportation network could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.”
 
  Advertising
 
      The Company uses television, in-store signage, graphics, a Company website, two e-commerce websites and social media as its primary advertising media.  The Company’s total advertising expenditures were approximately 0.7%, 0.7% and 0.8% of retail sales for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Store Operations
 
      The Company’s store operations management team consists of one director of stores, five territorial managers, 16 regional managers and 136 district managers. Regional managers receive a salary plus a bonus based on achieving targeted goals for sales, payroll and shrinkage control. District managers receive a salary plus a bonus based on achieving targeted objectives for district sales increases and shrinkage control. Stores are typically staffed with a manager, two assistant managers and additional part-time sales associates depending on the size of the store and seasonal personnel needs. Store managers receive a salary and all other store personnel are paid on an hourly basis. Store managers, assistant managers and sales associates are eligible for monthly and semi-annual bonuses based on achieving targeted goals for their store’s sales increases and shrinkage control.
 
      The Company constantly strives to improve its training programs to develop associates. Over 80% of store and field management are promoted from within, allowing the Company to internally staff its store base. The Company has training programs at each level of store operations. New store managers are trained in training stores managed by experienced associates who have achieved superior results in meeting the Company’s goals for store sales, payroll expense and shrinkage control. The type and extent of district manager training varies depending on whether the district manager is promoted from within or recruited from outside the Company.
 
Store Locations
 
      Most of the Company’s stores are located in the southeastern United States in a variety of markets ranging from small towns to large metropolitan areas with trade area populations of 20,000 or more. Stores average approximately 4,500 square feet in size.
 
      All of the Company’s stores are leased. Approximately 97% are located in strip shopping centers and 3% in enclosed shopping malls. The Company typically locates stores in strip shopping centers anchored by a national discounter, primarily Walmart Supercenters, or market-dominant grocery stores. The Company’s strip center locations provide ample parking and shopping convenience for its customers.
 
      The Company’s store development activities consist of opening new stores in new and existing markets, relocating selected existing stores to more desirable locations in the same market area and closing underperforming stores. The following table sets forth information with respect to the Company’s development activities since fiscal 2014:

Store Development 
-------------------------
 | Number of Stores | | | 
 | Beginning of | Number | Number | Number of Stores
Fiscal Year | Year | Opened | Closed | End of Year 
2014………………….……...…………. | 1,320 | 33 | 7 | 1,346 
2015………………….……...…………. | 1,346 | 31 | 5 | 1,372 
2016……………………….……...……. | 1,372 | 8 | 9 | 1,371 
2017…………....………….……...……. | 1,371 | 6 | 26 | 1,351 
2018………….………...….……...……. | 1,351 | - | 40 | 1,311 

 
     The Company expects to open 12 new stores during fiscal 2019. The Company anticipates closing up to 51 stores and relocating two stores by year end.  
 
      The Company periodically reviews its store base to determine whether any particular store should be closed based on its sales trends and profitability. The Company intends to continue this review process to identify underperforming stores. 
 
Credit and Layaway
 
  Credit Card Program
 
The Company offers its own credit card, which accounted for 3.3%, 3.3% and 3.4% of retail sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company’s net bad debt expense was 3.8%, 3.8% and 3.5% of credit sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Customers applying for the Company’s credit card are approved for credit if they have a satisfactory credit record and the Company has considered the customer’s ability to make the required minimum payment.  Customers are required to make minimum monthly payments based on their account balances. If the balance is not paid in full each month, the Company assesses the customer a finance charge. If payments are not received on time, the customer is assessed a late fee subject to regulatory limits.
 
  Layaway Plan
 
Under the Company’s layaway plan, merchandise is set aside for customers who agree to make periodic payments. The Company adds a nonrefundable administrative fee to each layaway sale. If no payment is made within four weeks, the customer is considered to have defaulted, and the merchandise is returned to the selling floor and again offered for sale, often at a reduced price. All payments made by customers who subsequently default on their layaway purchase are returned to the customer upon request, less the administrative fee and a restocking fee. 
 
The Company defers recognition of layaway sales to the accounting period when the customer picks up and completely pays for layaway merchandise.  Administrative fees are recognized in the period in which the layaway is initiated.  Recognition of restocking fees occurs in the accounting period when the customer defaults on the layaway purchase. Layaway sales represented approximately 4.0%, 4.0% and 4.4% of retail sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Information Technology Systems
 
      The Company’s information technology systems provide daily financial and merchandising information that is used by management to enhance the timeliness and effectiveness of purchasing and pricing decisions. Management uses a daily report comparing actual sales with planned sales and a weekly ranking report to monitor and control purchasing decisions. Weekly reports are also produced which reflect sales, weeks of supply of inventory and other critical data by product categories, by store and by various levels of responsibility reporting. Purchases are made based on projected sales, but can be modified to accommodate unexpected increases or decreases in demand for a particular item.

      Sales information is projected by merchandise category and, in some cases, is further projected and actual performance measured by stock keeping unit (SKU). Merchandise allocation models are used to distribute merchandise to individual stores based upon historical sales trends, climatic differences, customer demographic differences and targeted inventory turnover rates.
 
Competition
 
      The women’s retail apparel industry is highly competitive. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in its industry include merchandise assortment and presentation, fashion, price, store location and customer service. The Company competes with retail chains that operate similar women’s apparel specialty stores. In addition, the Company competes with mass merchandise chains, discount store chains, major department stores, off-price retailers and internet-based retailers.  Although we believe we compete favorably with respect to the principal competitive factors described above, many of our direct and indirect competitors are well-established national, regional or local chains, and some have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources.  The Company expects its stores in larger cities and metropolitan areas to face more intense competition.
Seasonality
 
      Due to the seasonal nature of the retail business, the Company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenues, operating income and net income.  Results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year.  Furthermore, the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods.  See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our quarterly results of operations for the last two fiscal years.
Regulation
 
      A variety of laws affect the revolving credit card program offered by the Company. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (“The Act”) amended the Truth in Lending Act to establish fair and transparent practices relating to the extension of credit under an open end consumer credit plan.  The Act contained provisions addressing matters such as change in terms, notices, limits on fees, rate increases, payment allocation and account disclosures.  The Act requires creditors to provide consumers with account disclosures that are timely and in a form that is readily understandable.  The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act also requires certain disclosures to potential customers concerning credit information used as a basis to deny credit. The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B promulgated thereunder prohibit lenders from discrimination against any credit applicants, establish guidelines for gathering and evaluating credit information and require written notification when credit is denied.  Regulation AA, Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices, establishes consumer complaint procedures and defines unfair or deceptive practices in extending credit to consumers.  The Federal Trade Commission has adopted or proposed various trade regulation rules dealing with unfair credit and collection practices and the preservation of consumers’ claims and defenses. The Company is also subject to the U.S. Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act, which require the Company to monitor account holders and account transactions, respectively. Additionally, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires the Company to disclose to its customers the Company’s privacy policy as it relates to a customer’s non-public personal information.
 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) enacted during fiscal 2017 significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21%, imposing a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As of February 2, 2019, the accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act has been completed.

As of February 2, 2019, the Company’s position is that its overseas subsidiaries will not invest undistributed earnings indefinitely.  Future unremitted earnings when distributed are expected to be either distributions of GILTI-previously taxed income or eligible for a 100% dividends received deduction.  The withholding tax rate on any unremitted earnings is zero and state income taxes on such earnings are considered immaterial.  Therefore, the Company has not provided deferred U.S. income taxes on approximately $7.1 million of earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries.
 
Associates
 
      As of February 2, 2019, the Company employed approximately 10,350 full-time and part-time associates. The Company also employs additional part-time associates during the peak retailing seasons. The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and considers its associate relations to be good.
