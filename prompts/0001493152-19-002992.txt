Item 1 – Business
General Development of Business
 
UMH Properties, Inc. (“UMH”), together with its predecessors and consolidated subsidiaries, are referred to herein as “we”, “us”, “our”, or “the Company”, unless the context requires otherwise.
 
UMH is a self-administered and self-managed qualified real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). The Company had elected REIT status effective January 1, 1992 and intends to maintain its qualification as a REIT in the future. As a qualified REIT, with limited exceptions, the Company will not be taxed under Federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on taxable income that it distributes to its shareholders. For special tax provisions applicable to REITs, refer to Sections 856-860 of the Code.
 
The Company was incorporated in the state of New Jersey in 1968. On September 29, 2003, the Company changed its state of incorporation from New Jersey to Maryland by merging with and into a Maryland corporation.
 
Narrative Description of Business
 
The Company’s primary business is the ownership and operation of manufactured home communities – leasing manufactured homesites to private manufactured home owners. The Company also leases homes to residents, and through its wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, UMH Sales and Finance, Inc. (“S&F”), conducts manufactured home sales in its communities.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company owns and operates 118 manufactured home communities containing approximately 21,500 developed homesites. These communities are located in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Indiana, Michigan and Maryland.
 
A manufactured home community is designed to accommodate detached, single-family manufactured homes. These manufactured homes are produced off-site by manufacturers and installed on sites within the communities. These homes may be improved with the addition of features constructed on-site, including garages, screened rooms and carports. Manufactured homes are available in a variety of designs and floor plans, offering many amenities and custom options. Each manufactured home owner leases the site on which the home is located from the Company. The Company owns the underlying land, utility connections, streets, lighting, driveways, common area amenities and other capital improvements and are responsible for enforcement of community guidelines and maintenance.
 
Manufactured homes are accepted by the public as a viable and economically attractive alternative to common stick-built single-family housing. The affordability of the modern manufactured home makes it a very attractive housing alternative. Depending on the region of the country, construction cost per square foot for a new manufactured home averages anywhere from 10 to 50 percent less than a comparable site-built home, excluding the cost of land. This is due to a number of factors, including volume purchase discounts and inventory control of construction materials and control of all aspects of the construction process, which is generally a more efficient and stream-lined process as compared to a site-built home.
 
Modern residential land lease communities are similar to typical residential subdivisions containing central entrances, paved well-lit streets, curbs and gutters. Generally, modern manufactured home communities contain buildings for recreation, green areas, and other common area facilities, all of which are the property of the community owner. In addition to such general improvements, certain manufactured home communities include recreational improvements such as swimming pools, tennis courts and playgrounds. Municipal water and sewer services are available in some manufactured home communities, while other communities supply these facilities on-site.
 
Typically, our leases are on an annual or month-to-month basis, renewable upon the consent of both parties. The community manager interviews prospective residents, collects rent and finance payments, ensures compliance with community regulations, maintains public areas and community facilities and is responsible for the overall appearance of the community. The homeowner is responsible for the maintenance of the home and leased site. As a result, our capital expenditures tend to be less significant relative to multi-family rental apartments. Manufactured home communities produce predictable income streams and provide protection from inflation due to the ability to annually increase rents.

Many of our communities compete with other manufactured home community properties located in the same or nearby markets that are owned and operated by other companies in our business. We generally monitor the rental rates and other terms being offered by our competitors and consider this information as a factor in determining our own rental rates. In addition to competing with other manufactured home community properties, our communities also compete with alternative forms of housing (such as apartments and single-family homes).
 
In connection with the operation of its communities, UMH also leases homes to prospective tenants. As of December 31, 2018, UMH owned a total of 6,500 rental homes, representing approximately 30% of its developed homesites. These rental homes are owned by the Company and rented to residents. The Company engages in the rental of manufactured homes primarily in areas where the communities have existing vacancies. The rental homes produce income from both the home and the site which might otherwise be non-income producing. The Company sells the rental homes when the opportunity arises.
 
Inherent in the operation of a manufactured home community is the development, redevelopment, and expansion of our communities. The Company sells and finances the sale of manufactured homes in our communities through S&F. S&F was established to potentially enhance the value of our communities. The home sales business is operated like other homebuilders with sales centers, model homes, an inventory of completed homes and the ability to supply custom designed homes based upon the requirements of the new homeowners.
 
Investment and Other Policies
 
The Company may invest in improved and unimproved real property and may develop unimproved real property. Such properties may be located throughout the United States, but the Company has concentrated on the Northeast and Midwest. Since 2010, we have tripled the size of our property portfolio from 28 communities with approximately 6,800 developed homesites to 118 communities with over 21,500 developed homesites. We are focused on acquiring communities with significant upside potential and leveraging our expertise to build long-term capital appreciation.
 
The Company seeks to finance acquisitions with the most appropriate available source of capital, including purchase money mortgages or other financing, which may be first liens, wraparound mortgages or subordinated indebtedness, sales of investments, and issuance of additional equity securities. In connection with its ongoing activities, the Company may issue notes, mortgages or other senior securities. The Company intends to use both secured and unsecured lines of credit.
 
The Company may issue securities for property; however, this has not occurred to date. The Company may repurchase or reacquire its shares from time to time if, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, such acquisition is advantageous to the Company. No shares were repurchased or reacquired during 2018 and, as of December 31, 2018, the Company does not own any of its own shares.
 
The Company also owns a portfolio of marketable REIT securities, which the Company generally limits to no more than approximately 15% of its undepreciated assets (which is the Company’s total assets excluding accumulated depreciation). These liquid real estate holdings provide diversification, additional liquidity and income, and serves as a proxy for real estate when more favorable risk adjusted returns are not available. The Company, from time to time, may purchase these securities on margin when the interest and dividend yields exceed the cost of funds. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had borrowings of $31,975,086 under its margin line at 2.75% interest. The REIT securities portfolio is subject to risk arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, primarily interest rate risk and market price risk relating to equity securities. From time to time, the Company may use derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk; however, this has not occurred during any periods presented. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had $99,595,736 and $132,964,276, respectively, of marketable securities. Included in these securities are Preferred Stock of $3,399,558 and $5,377,522 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The realized net gain on marketable securities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $20,107 and $1,747,528, respectively. The unrealized net gain (loss) on marketable securities at December 31, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $(40,155,814) and $11,519,582, respectively.

Regulations, Insurance and Property Maintenance and Improvement
 
Manufactured home communities are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to recreational facilities such as swimming pools, clubhouses and other common areas, and regulations relating to operating water and wastewater treatment facilities at several of our communities. We believe that each community has all material operating permits and approvals.
 
Our properties are insured against risks that may cause property damage and business interruption including events such as fire, business interruption, general liability and if applicable, flood. Our insurance policies contain deductible requirements, coverage limits and particular exclusions. It is the policy of the Company to maintain adequate insurance coverage on all of our properties; and, in the opinion of management, all of our properties are adequately insured. We also obtain title insurance insuring fee title to the properties in an aggregate amount which we believe to be adequate.
 
It is the policy of the Company to properly maintain, modernize, expand and make improvements to its properties when required. The Company anticipates that renovation expenditures with respect to its present properties during 2019 will be approximately $16 million.
