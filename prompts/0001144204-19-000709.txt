Item 1.          BUSINESS
General
 
Hurco Companies, Inc. is an international, industrial technology company.  We design, manufacture and sell computerized (i.e., Computer Numeric Control (“CNC”)) machine tools, consisting primarily of vertical machining centers (mills) and turning centers (lathes), to companies in the metal cutting industry through a worldwide sales, service and distribution network.  Although the majority of our computer control systems and software products are proprietary, they predominantly use industry standard personal computer components.  Our computer control systems and software products are primarily sold as integral components of our computerized machine tool products.  We also provide machine tool components, software options, control upgrades, accessories and replacement parts for our products, as well as customer service and training and applications support. As used in this report, the words “we”, “us”, “our”, “Hurco” and the “Company” refer to Hurco Companies, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Since our founding in 1968, we have been a leader in the introduction of interactive computer control systems that automate manufacturing processes and improve productivity in the metal parts manufacturing industry. We pioneered the application of microprocessor technology and conversational programming software for use in machine tools.  Our computer control systems can be operated by both skilled and unskilled machine tool operators and yet are capable of instructing a machine to perform complex tasks.  The combination of microprocessor technology and patented interactive, conversational programming software in our computer control systems enables operators on the production floor to quickly and easily create a program for machining a particular part from a blueprint or computer aided design file and immediately begin machining that part.

Our executive offices and principal design and engineering operations are headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.  Sales, application engineering and service subsidiaries are located in China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. We have manufacturing and assembly operations in Taiwan, the U.S., Italy and China, and distribution facilities in the U.S., the Netherlands, and Taiwan.
 
Our strategy is to design, manufacture and sell a comprehensive line of computerized machine tools that help customers in the worldwide metal cutting market increase productivity and profitability. The majority of our machine tools employ proprietary, interactive, computer control technology that increases productivity through ease of operation via interactive conversational and graphical programming software. All of our machine tools deliver high levels of machine performance (speed, accuracy and surface finish quality) that increases productivity. We routinely expand our product offerings to meet customer needs, which has led us to design and manufacture more complex machining centers with advanced capabilities.  We bring a disciplined approach to strategically enter new geographic markets, as appropriate.
 
Industry
 
Machine tool products are considered capital goods, which makes them part of an industry that has historically been highly cyclical. 
 
Industry association data for the U.S. machine tool market is available and that market accounts for approximately 10% of worldwide consumption.  Reports available for the U.S. machine tool market include:

• | United States Machine Tool Consumption – generated by the Association for Manufacturing Technology, this report includes metal cutting machines of all types and sizes, including segments in which we do not compete
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Purchasing Manager’s Index – developed by the Institute for Supply Management, this report includes activity levels in U.S. manufacturing plants that purchase machine tools 
• | Capacity Utilization of Manufacturing Companies – issued by the Federal Reserve Board 

 
A limited amount of information is available for foreign markets, and different reporting methodologies are used by various countries. Machine tool consumption data, published by Gardner Publications, Inc., calculates machine tool consumption annually by country.  It is important to note that data for foreign countries are based on government reports that may lag 6 to 12 months behind real–time and, therefore, are unreliable for forecasting purposes. 
 
Demand for capital equipment can fluctuate significantly during periods of changing economic conditions.  Manufacturers and suppliers of capital goods, such as our company, are often the first to experience these changes in demand. Additionally, since our typical order backlog is approximately 45 days, it is difficult to estimate demand with any reasonable certainty. Therefore, we do not have the benefit of relying on the common leading indicators that other industries use for market analysis and forecasting purposes.
 
Products
 
Our core products consist of general purpose computerized machine tools for the metal cutting industry, principally, vertical machining centers (mills) and turning centers (lathes). The majority of our machine tools are equipped and integrated fully with our proprietary software and computer control systems, while the remaining machine tools are equipped with industry standard controls. Additionally, we produce and distribute software options, control upgrades, hardware accessories and replacement parts for our machine tool product lines, and we provide operator training and support services to our customers. We also produce computer control systems and related software for press brake applications that are sold as retrofit units for installation on existing or new press brake machines.

Product Portfolio by Brand
 
We have three brands of CNC machine tools in our product portfolio: Hurco is the premium brand focused on innovative technology. Milltronics is the general purpose brand with a simplified control and straightforward feature sets. Takumi is an industry standard brand with machines that are equipped with industry standard controls instead of the proprietary controls found on Hurco and Milltronics machines. Typically, manufacturing facilities that use industry standard controls focus on medium to high production, wherein they run large batches of a few types of parts instead of small batches of many different types of parts. The Takumi brand also is targeted to die and mold customers. In addition, through our wholly–owned subsidiary LCM Precision Technology S.r.l. (“LCM”), we produce machine tool components and accessories. The main product categories of each brand are outlined below.
 
The Hurco, Milltronics and Takumi product lines represent a comprehensive product portfolio with more than 150 different models. The combined machine tool product lines also provide benefits related to the development of product enhancements, technologies and models due to leverage of shared resources and cross–utilization of proven engineering designs that allow us to achieve manufacturing cost reductions from economies of scale and manufacturing efficiencies.
 
Hurco CNC Machine Tools
 
Hurco computerized machine tools are equipped with a fully integrated interactive computer control system that features our proprietary WinMax® software. Our computer control system enables a machine tool operator to create complex two–dimensional or three–dimensional machining programs directly from an engineering drawing or computer–aided design geometry file. An operator with little or no machine tool programming experience can successfully create a program with minimal training and begin machining the part in a short period of time.  The control features an operator console with active touch, and incorporates an upgradeable personal computer (PC) platform using a high speed processor with solid rendering graphical programming.  In addition, WinMax® has a Windows®† based operating system that enables users to improve shop floor flexibility and software productivity. Companies using computer controlled machine tools are better able to:
 
• | maximize the efficiency of their human resources; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | make more advanced and complex parts from a wide range of materials using multiple processes;


• | incorporate fast moving changes in technology into their operations to keep their competitive edge; and

• | integrate their business into the global supply chain of their customers by supporting small to medium lot sizes for “just in time” initiatives.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our Windows® based control facilitates our ability to meet these customer needs. The familiar Windows® operating system coupled with our intuitive conversational style of program creation allows our customers’ operators to create and edit part–making programs without incurring the incremental overhead of specialized computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing programmers. With the ability to transfer most computer aided design data directly into a Hurco program, programming time can be significantly reduced.
 
Machine tool products today are being designed to meet the demand for machining complex parts with greater part accuracies.  Our proprietary controls with WinMax® software and high–speed processors efficiently handle the large amounts of data these complex part–making programs require, which enable our customers to create parts with higher accuracy at faster speeds. We continue to add technology to our control design as it becomes available. For example, UltiMotion, our patented motion control system, provides significant cycle time reductions and increases the quality of a part’s surface finish. This technology differentiates us in the marketplace and is incorporated into our control.

UltiMonitor is a web–based productivity, management and service tool that enables customers to monitor, inspect and receive notifications about their Hurco machines from any location where they can access the internet. Customers can transfer part designs, receive event notifications via email or text, access diagnostic data, monitor the machine via webcam and communicate with the machine operator.
 
UltiPocket with Helical Ramp Entry and Insert Pockets automatically calculates the tool path around islands, eliminating the arduous task of plotting these shapes.  Islands can also be rotated, scaled and repeated.
 
Conversational Part and Tool Probing options permit the computerized dimensional measurement of machined parts and the associated cutting tools.  This “on–machine” technique improves the throughput of the measurement process when compared to traditional “off–machine” approaches.
 
The Tool and Material Library option stores the tool and material information with the machine instead of storing it with each individual part program. The user enters the tool data and geometry one time and chooses the particular tool from the list when it is needed. Additionally, the library reads the part program and automatically locates the tool or displays an alert if the tool does not exist. In addition to saving time, the Tool and Material Library eliminates the need to enter information repeatedly and can prevent common tool crash conditions.
 
NC/Conversational Merge lets the user incorporate conversational features, such as tool probing, pattern operations, and scaling into existing G–Code programs.
 
Job List provides an intuitive way to group files together and run them sequentially without operator intervention, which promotes automation, lights–out machining, program stitching, file bundling, and adaptive processes.
 
Stream Load allows the user to run very large NC files without the need to upload the entire file into the control’s memory to avoid exceeding memory limits.
 
Linear Thermal Compensation is a feature that allows the user to specify corrections to compensate for the effects of thermal growth in high speed machining applications.
 
Thread Repair is a feature for turning applications that provides an efficient way to repair existing threads, which is especially beneficial for large pipes and other parts manufactured for the oil/energy sector.
 
Simultaneous Five–Axis Contouring software enables a five–axis machine to command motion concurrently on all axes. This allows the user to create continuous tool–paths along complex geometries with only a single machine/part setup, providing increased productivity along with the performance benefits of using shorter cutting tools. The sale of simultaneous five–axis contouring software is subject to government export licensing requirements.

Demand
 
We believe demand for our products is driven by advances in industrial technology and the related demand for automated process improvements. Other factors affecting demand include:

• | the need to continuously improve productivity and shorten cycle time; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | an aging machine tool installed base which will require replacement with more advanced technology; 
• | the industrial development of emerging markets in Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe; and 
• | the declining supply of skilled machinists. 

 
Demand for our products is also highly dependent upon economic conditions and the general level of business confidence, as well as such factors as production capacity utilization and changes in governmental policies regarding tariffs, corporate taxation, fluctuations in foreign currencies, and other investment incentives. 
 
Competition
 
We compete with many other machine tool producers in the United States and foreign countries.   Most of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than our company.  Major worldwide competitors include DMG Mori Seiki Co., Ltd., Mazak, Haas Automation, Inc., Hardinge Inc., Doosan, Okuma Machinery Works Ltd, Hyundai and Feeler.  
 
Through our subsidiary LCM, we compete with manufacturers of machine tool components and accessories such as IBAG, Kessler, Peron Speed, GSA Technology Co., LTD and Duplomatic Automation.
 
We strive to compete by developing patentable software and other proprietary features that offer enhanced productivity, technological capabilities and ease of use.  We offer our products in a range of prices and capabilities to target a broad potential market.  We also believe that our competitiveness is aided by our reputation for reliability and quality, our strong international sales and distribution organization, and our extensive customer service organization.

Intellectual Property
 
We consider the majority of our products to be proprietary. Various features of our Hurco and Milltronics control systems and machine tools employ technologies covered by patents and trademarks that are material to our business. We also own additional patents covering new technologies that we have acquired or developed, and that we are planning to incorporate into our control systems or products in the future.
Employees
 
We had approximately 800 full–time employees at the end of fiscal 2018, none of whom are covered by a collective–bargaining agreement or represented by a union. We have experienced no employee–generated work stoppages or disruptions, and we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
