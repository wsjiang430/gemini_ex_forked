Company Overview
We are one of the largest global apparel companies in the world. We have approximately 31,000 associates operating in more than 40 countries and generated $9.0 billion, $9.2 billion and $7.1 billion in revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our iconic brands, TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein, together generated over 90% of our revenue during each of 2022 and 2021, and over 85% of our revenue during 2020. Our business was significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, resulting in an unprecedented material decline in revenue. Revenue in 2021 and 2022 continued to be negatively impacted by the pandemic and related supply chain and logistics disruptions, although to a much lesser extent than in 2020. Please see our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 of this report for further discussion.
We manage a portfolio of iconic brands, including TOMMY HILFIGER, Calvin Klein, Warner’s, Olga and True&Co., which are owned, Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW and Geoffrey Beene, which we owned through the second quarter of 2021 and now license back for certain product categories, and other owned and licensed brands. We refer to our owned and licensed trademarks, other than TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein, as our “heritage brands” and the businesses we operate under the heritage brands trademarks as our Heritage Brands business.
We design and market branded sportswear (casual apparel), jeanswear, performance apparel, intimate apparel, underwear, swimwear, dress shirts, neckwear, handbags, accessories, footwear and other related products. Our brands are positioned to sell globally at various price points and in multiple channels of distribution. This enables us to offer differentiated products to a broad range of consumers, reducing our reliance on any one demographic group, product category, price point, distribution channel or region. We also license the use of our trademarks to third parties and joint ventures for product categories and in regions where we believe our licensees’ expertise can better serve our brands.

Our directly operated businesses in North America during 2022 consisted principally of (i) wholesale sales under our TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein trademarks and our owned and licensed heritage brands; (ii) the operation of digital commerce sites under our TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein trademarks; and (iii) the operation of retail stores, principally in premium outlet centers, under our TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein trademarks. Our directly operated businesses outside of North America consisted principally of (i) our wholesale and retail sales in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region under our TOMMY HILFIGER trademarks; (ii) our wholesale and retail sales in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and Brazil under our Calvin Klein trademarks; and (iii) the operation of digital commerce sites in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region under the TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein trademarks, and in Brazil under the Calvin Klein trademark. Our licensing activities principally related to the licensing worldwide of our TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein trademarks for a broad array of product categories and for use in numerous discrete jurisdictions.
We have evolved from our 1881 roots to become a global company of iconic brands through a combination of transformative acquisitions and by successfully growing our brands globally across all channels of distribution. Our key acquisitions include the acquisition of Calvin Klein, Inc. and certain affiliated companies (“Calvin Klein”) in February 2003 (the “Calvin Klein acquisition”), the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger B.V. and certain affiliated companies (“Tommy Hilfiger”) in May 2010 (the “Tommy Hilfiger acquisition”), and the acquisition of The Warnaco Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Warnaco”) in February 2013 (the “Warnaco acquisition”). We also have acquired several regional licensed businesses and will continue to explore strategic acquisitions of licensed businesses, trademarks and companies that we believe are additive to our overall business.
We extended in November 2022 most of our licensing agreements with G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (“G-III”) for Calvin Klein and TOMMY HILFIGER in the United States and Canada, largely pertaining to the women’s apparel product categories sold at wholesale in North America. These agreements now have staggered expirations from the end of 2023 through 2027. Upon expiration, we intend to bring most of the licensed product categories in-house and directly operate these businesses. 
We completed the sale of certain of our heritage brands trademarks, including Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW and Geoffrey Beene, as well as certain related inventories of our Heritage Brands business to Authentic Brands Group (“ABG”) and other parties (the “Heritage Brands transaction”), on the first day of the third quarter of 2021.
We licensed Speedo for North America and the Caribbean until April 6, 2020, on which date we sold the Speedo North America business to Pentland Group PLC (“Pentland”), the parent company of the Speedo brand. Upon the closing of the transaction, we deconsolidated the net assets of the Speedo North America business and no longer licensed the Speedo trademark.
We aggregate our reportable segments for purposes of discussion in this report into three main businesses: (i) Tommy Hilfiger, which consists of the Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments; (ii) Calvin Klein, which consists of the Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International segments; and (iii) Heritage Brands, which consists of the Heritage Brands Wholesale segment and, through the second quarter of 2021, the Heritage Brands Retail segment. We announced in 2020 a plan to exit our Heritage Brands Retail business, which was completed in 2021. Our Heritage Brands Retail segment has ceased operations. Note 20, “Segment Data,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report contains information with respect to revenue, income (loss) before interest and taxes, assets, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures related to each segment, as well as information regarding our revenue generated by distribution channel and based on geographic location, and the geographic locations where our net property, plant and equipment is held.

We completed the exit from the business in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 Our Business Strategy
At our April 2022 Investor Day, we introduced the PVH+ Plan, our multi-year, strategic plan to drive brand-, digital- and direct-to-consumer-led growth and deliver financial performance for sustainable, long-term profitable growth and value creation. The execution of the PVH+ Plan builds on the core strengths of PVH to unlock the full potential of our two global iconic brands, Calvin Klein and TOMMY HILFIGER, through five key drivers: 
•Win with product – By developing compelling products in the market across key growth categories, with a focus on expanding in large and growing global demand spaces where our iconic brands resonate most with consumers.
•Win with consumer engagement – By driving digital-first, 360° consumer engagement built around brand, key products and key consumer moments, partnering with creators in the industry who we believe are most relevant to each of our brands, and building out each brand’s ambassador program, to meet consumers on their terms in new and engaging ways.
•Win in the digitally-led marketplace – By building a holistic distribution strategy for Calvin Klein and TOMMY HILFIGER, led by digital and direct-to-consumer channels, and supported by key wholesale partnerships. 
•Develop a demand- and data-driven operating model – By driving a systematic and repeatable product creation model that puts the consumer first and leverages data to bring products consumers most desire to market with speed and agility.
•Drive efficiencies and invest in growth – By becoming more cost-competitive and reinvesting in key strategic growth drivers. We are simplifying how our teams work and identifying efficiencies to fuel growth initiatives with the greatest positive impact and strongest return.
These five foundational drivers apply to each of our businesses and are activated in the regions to meet the unique expectations of our consumers around the world. 
 Other Strategic Opportunities 
We manage a portfolio of global iconic brands, including TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein. We do continue to explore strategic acquisitions of licensed businesses, companies and trademarks, licensing take-backs and licensing opportunities that we believe are additive to our overall business. These could include product category, platform capability expertise, brand positioning and design perspective needs. We take a disciplined approach to any acquisitions, seeking brands with broad consumer recognition that we can grow profitably and expand by leveraging our infrastructure and core competencies.

Seasonality
Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our wholesale businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the first and third quarters, while our retail businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the fourth quarter. Royalty, advertising and other revenue tends to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year, although the third quarter tends to have the highest level of royalty revenue due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season. The COVID-19 pandemic and related supply chain and logistics disruptions have disrupted these patterns, however. We otherwise expect this seasonal pattern will generally continue. Working capital requirements vary throughout the year to support these seasonal patterns and business trends.
Design
Our business depends on our ability to appeal and respond to consumer tastes and demands, as well as on our ability to remain competitive in the areas of quality, sustainability and delivering a compelling price value proposition where the consumer is shopping.
Our in-house design teams, together with our merchandising teams, are significant contributors to the continued strength of our brands. Each of our branded businesses employs its own team of designers and merchandisers that are responsible for conceptualizing and implementing the design direction for the brand across the consumer touchpoints of product, stores and marketing. Designers have access to the brands’ extensive archives of product designs, which are a valuable resource for new product concepts. Our designers collaborate with merchandising teams that analyze sales, market trends and consumer preferences to identify market opportunities that help guide each season’s design process and create a globally relevant product assortment. Leveraging our strategic investments in data and analytics tools, merchandisers are able to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior that empowers our teams to respond to changes in consumer preferences and demand, as well as scale opportunities across brands with greater speed and efficiency. Our merchandising teams manage the product life cycle to maximize sales and profitability across all channels. In an effort to keep our brands relevant, our teams also work with other brands and key collaborators to design and merchandise brand collaborations. These collaborations are intended to drive brand heat and product relevance with our target consumers.
Our teams have expanded their use of 3D design technology to enhance our design capabilities, which was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing the need for samples early in the design process and the time needed to bring products to market. 
Product Sourcing
We have an extensive established network of worldwide sourcing partners that enables us to meet our customers’ needs without relying on any one vendor or factory or on vendors or factories in any one country. Our products were produced in approximately 1,100 factories in approximately 40 countries during 2022. All of these factories were operated by independent manufacturers, with most located in Asia. 
We source finished products and, to a limited extent, raw materials and trim. Raw materials and trim include fabric, buttons, thread, labels and similar components. Finished products consist of manufactured and fully assembled products ready for shipment to our customers and our stores. Raw material, trim and finished product commitments are generally made two to six months prior to production. We believe that an ample number of alternative suppliers exist should we need to secure additional or replacement production capacity and raw materials. 
Our purchases from our suppliers are effected through individual purchase orders specifying the price, quantity, delivery date and destination of the items to be produced. Sales are monitored regularly at both the retail and wholesale levels and modifications in production can be made either to increase or reduce inventories. We look to establish long-term supplier relationships in the appropriate locations throughout the world to meet our needs and we place our orders in a manner designed to limit the risk that a production disruption at any one facility could cause a serious inventory problem, while seeking to maximize pricing opportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic has had impacts throughout our supply chain, including as a result of vessel, container and other transportation shortages, labor shortages and port congestion globally, as well as production delays in some of our key sourcing countries, which has delayed product orders. We have incurred, beginning in the second half of 2021 and throughout the first half of 2022, higher air freight and other logistics costs in connection with these disruptions. To mitigate these supply chain and logistics disruptions, we increased our core product inventory levels in 2022. We continue to 
8 


monitor for any production delays and other potential disruptions in our supply chain and will continue to implement mitigation plans as needed. 
The manufacturers of our products are required to meet our quality, human rights, safety, environmental and cost requirements. Our global supply chain teams, offices and buying agents enable us to monitor the quality of the goods manufactured by, and the delivery performance of, our suppliers and work with our global compliance teams to ensure the enforcement of our human rights and labor standards and other code of conduct requirements through our ongoing extensive training, approval and monitoring system. They also monitor and track the primary cost inputs to the finished product to ensure that we pay the most appropriate cost for our finished goods. 
We continue to explore new areas of production that can grow with our businesses. Our country of origin strategy provides a flexible approach to product sourcing, which enables us to maximize regional opportunities and mitigate our potential exposure to risks associated with new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions, as has been the case with China, where we have been reducing the amount of production over time in favor of production in other parts of Asia that better serve our sourcing strategy. Many of these efforts have been with our existing partners, but in facilities and countries that offer us production or cost advantages over those in China. 
We also continue to develop strategies that can enhance the operational efficiency of our supply chain and unlock gross margin opportunities. In addition to expanding our use of 3D design technology to reduce the time needed to bring products to market, we have also utilized 3D showrooms to be more cost and time efficient. Speed is another critical focus area across the Company. We have implemented various speed models, core replenishment and read and react capabilities for select categories to enhance our operations and make our business model more dynamic and responsive, while also increasing service levels, reducing inventory exposure and improving quality and consumer value. We believe the enhancement of our supply chain efficiencies and working capital management through the effective use of our distribution network and overall infrastructure will allow us to control costs better and provide improved service to our customers.
Corporate Responsibility
As an industry leader and one of the largest fashion companies in the world, we recognize that we have a responsibility to address our social and environmental impacts. Corporate responsibility has always played a critical role within our broader business strategy. We are steadfast in our commitment to drive fashion forward – for good – by finding innovative and responsible solutions to protect our planet, cultivating an environment of inclusion, diversity and equity, and improving the lives of women and children where we live and work. 
Forward Fashion, our global corporate responsibility strategy, is our roadmap for reaching our time-bound commitments in the critical areas of climate change and human rights. It represents a deepening of our commitment to action and a renewed sense of urgency to use our scale to transform ourselves and the industry. We are committed to the goals outlined in our Forward Fashion strategy and remain focused on the following:
•Protecting the global climate by reducing energy use and powering our business through renewable sources, diverting the waste we send to landfills, eliminating water pollution from our wet processors, and fostering and harnessing innovation to design and manufacture products that eliminate product waste.
•Ensuring our products and packaging are ethically and sustainably sourced from suppliers who respect human rights and are good employers. 
•Improving the lives of the people across our value chain, focusing on education and opportunities for women and children, ensuring access to clean water, investing in health and education initiatives, and continuing to champion inclusion and diversity.
Our businesses are an integral part of our Forward Fashion strategy and are equally committed to delivering against our corporate responsibility priorities. 
We issue an annual report on our corporate responsibility efforts that can be found on our corporate website.

Warehousing, Distribution and Logistics
Our products are shipped from manufacturers to our wholesale and retail warehousing and distribution centers for inspection, sorting, packing and shipment. Centers range in size, and our main facilities, some of which are owned and operated by independent third parties, are located in the United States, the Netherlands, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, Brazil and Australia. Our warehousing and distribution centers are designed to provide responsive service to our wholesale and digital commerce customers, as well as our retail stores, on a cost-effective basis. 
Material Customers
Our largest customers account for significant portions of our revenue. Sales to our five largest customers were 14.1% of our revenue in 2022, 15.0% of our revenue in 2021 and 16.3% of our revenue in 2020. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2022, 2021 or 2020.
Advertising and Promotion
Our marketing programs are an integral component of our brands’ relevance and success of the products offered under them. We are focused on driving consumer engagement though a digital-first 360° approach around key hero products and key consumer moments, utilizing our iconic brands as creative platforms for collaborations, capsule collections and experiential events, and partnering with culturally relevant talent to build brand heat. Our initiatives fuse entertainment, pop culture, and digital commerce in innovative ways that digitally immerse consumers. 
We build each of our brands to be a leader in its respective market segment, with strong consumer awareness, relevance and consumer loyalty. We design and market our products to complement each other, satisfy lifestyle needs, emphasize product features important to our target consumers, including sustainability attributes, deliver a strong price/value proposition and encourage consumer loyalty.
Our marketing and advertising efforts encompass marketing, communications, social media and special events. Our in-house teams coordinate our brands’ marketing and advertising, tailoring the overall consumer experience for all regions and product lines, and across all channels of distribution. We believe that this enhanced marketing approach enables us to meet our consumers’ needs as we adapt to their rapidly changing demands. 
A significant emphasis of our marketing programs is digital media, including our digital commerce platforms and social media channels, which allow us to expand our consumer reach and enable us to provide timely information in an entertaining fashion in regard to our products, special events, promotions and store locations. Tommy Hilfiger’s digital commerce site, tommy.com, and Calvin Klein’s digital commerce site, calvinklein.com, serve as marketing vehicles to complement the ongoing development of the TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein lifestyle brands, respectively, in addition to offering a broad array of apparel and licensed products. In 2022, a significant portion of our marketing and advertising spend related to digital media.
We leverage new ways to engage consumers through livestreaming fashion shows and other consumer activations and in partnership with top live-streamers and pure play partners, as well as through new innovative and creative ways that engage consumers in the metaverse. In addition, we advertise our brands through sport sponsorships and product tie-ins. We believe that our use of high-profile brand ambassadors and well-known social media influencers helps drive our brand awareness and cultural relevance. We have focused on better aligning regional needs with regional and local ambassadors and influencers to best cater to local market needs and unique activations. Additionally, the TOMMY HILFIGER brand marketing and communications team coordinates personal appearances by Mr. Tommy Hilfiger, including at brand events, as part of their efforts.        
Our approach is intended to ensure a consistent consumer experience in the digitally led marketplace that is seamlessly connected both online and offline, across all of our digital commerce, retail and wholesale channels.

Trademarks
We own the TOMMY HILFIGER, Calvin Klein, Warner’s, Olga and True&Co. trademarks, as well as related trademarks (e.g., the TOMMY HILFIGER flag logo and crest design) and lesser-known names. We own the Calvin Klein trademarks through our ownership of the Calvin Klein Trademark Trust (the “Trust”). The sole purpose of the Trust is to hold these marks. Our owned trademarks are registered for use in each of the primary countries where our products are sold and additional applications for registration of these and other trademarks are made in jurisdictions to accommodate new marks, uses in additional trademark classes or additional categories of goods or expansion into new countries.
Mr. Tommy Hilfiger is prohibited in perpetuity from using, or authorizing others to use, the TOMMY HILFIGER marks (except for the use by Mr. Hilfiger of his name personally and in connection with certain specified activities). In addition, we are prohibited in perpetuity from selling products not ordinarily sold under the names of prestige designer businesses or prestige global lifestyle brands without Mr. Hilfiger’s consent, from engaging in new lines of business materially different from such types of lines of business without Mr. Hilfiger’s consent, or from disparaging or intentionally tarnishing the TOMMY HILFIGER-related marks or Mr. Hilfiger’s personal name. 
Mr. Calvin Klein retains the right to use his name, on a non-competitive basis, with respect to his right of publicity, unless those rights are already being used in our Calvin Klein business. Mr. Klein also has been granted a royalty-free worldwide right to use the Calvin Klein mark with respect to certain personal businesses and activities, subject to certain limitations designed to protect the image and prestige of the Calvin Klein brands and to avoid competitive conflicts.
Our trademarks are the subject of registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of apparel, footwear and related products, as well as licensed product categories and other trademark classes relevant to how we conduct business. We continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of new and related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks continue to be used in connection with the products and services with which they are identified and, as to registered tradenames, the required registration renewals are filed. In markets where products bearing any of our brands are not sold by us or any of our licensees or other authorized users, our rights to the use of trademarks may not be clearly established.
Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets and we vigorously seek to protect them on a worldwide basis against infringement. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing on our intellectual property rights. The TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein brands, in particular, enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and their price-positioning provides opportunity and incentive for counterfeiters and infringers. We have broad, proactive enforcement programs that we believe have been generally effective in controlling the sale of counterfeit products in our key markets. 
Competition
The apparel industry is competitive as a result of its fashion orientation, mix of large and small producers, low barriers to entry, the flow of domestic and imported merchandise and the wide diversity of retailing methods. We compete with numerous domestic and foreign designers, brand owners, manufacturers and retailers of apparel, accessories and footwear, including, in certain circumstances, the private label brands of our wholesale customers. Additionally, with the shift in consumer shopping preferences driving substantial growth in the digital channel, there are more companies in the apparel sector and an increased level of transparency in pricing and product comparisons, which impacts purchasing decisions. Consumers also are increasingly focused on circularity with respect to apparel and the option from new market players to rent or purchase pre-owned apparel also is impacting purchasing decisions.
We believe we are well-positioned to compete in the apparel industry on the basis of style, quality, price and service. Our business depends on our ability to remain competitive in these areas, as well as on our ability to stimulate consumer tastes and demand through our product offerings and marketing and advertising efforts. Our brands are positioned to sell globally at various price points and in multiple channels of distribution. This enables us to offer differentiated products to a broad range of consumers, reducing our reliance on any one demographic group, product category, price point, distribution channel or region. Our brands generally have long histories and enjoy high recognition and awareness within their respective consumer segments. The worldwide recognition of the TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein brands provides us with significant global opportunities to expand their global penetration in existing markets, into new markets and into additional product categories.

Imports and Import Restrictions
Most of our products are imported into the countries where they are sold. These products are subject to various customs laws, which may impose tariffs, as well as quota restrictions and other laws and regulations covering imports. The United States and other countries in which we sell our products may impose, from time to time, new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions, including the imposition of a “safeguard quota,” or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels. We, therefore, continuously monitor import restrictions and developments. We seek to minimize, where appropriate and possible, our potential exposure to import related risks through, among other measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts of production among countries (including consideration of countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements), and manufacturers, and geographical diversification of our sources of supply. In some instances, production of a specific product category, component parts or raw materials may be highly concentrated in one country, giving us less flexibility to make adjustments.
The United States and China are involved in a trade dispute that saw the imposition in 2019 of significant additional tariffs on the products we sell that are imported into the United States from China. These tariffs remain in place. Additionally, other governmental actions, such as the imposition by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) of Withhold Release Orders (“WROs”) have had, continue to have and, in the future, may have an impact on our ability to import goods. Our industry has experienced and we have been impacted by, increased regulation and enforcement in 2022, in particular in regards to concerns around forced labor in supply chains. Please see our risk factor “We primarily use foreign suppliers for our products and raw materials, which poses risks to our business operations” in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for further discussion.
Government Regulations 
Our business is subject to various United States federal, state, and local and foreign laws and regulations, including environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, we may incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to the contamination of sites that we own or operate or previously owned or operated (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites and neighboring properties, or other persons) and the off-site disposal of hazardous materials. We believe our operations are in compliance with the terms of all applicable laws and regulations and our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. 
Human Capital Resources
We believe that attracting, developing and retaining capable and diverse talent is critical to our long-term success. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to create a strong associate experience and a diverse and inclusive workplace, with opportunities for our associates to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our associates and their communities.
Governance and Oversight
The PVH Board of Directors and its committees provide oversight on human capital matters. The Nominating, Governance & Management Development Committee is charged, in part, with monitoring issues of corporate conduct and culture, and provides oversight of diversity, equity and inclusion policies and programs as it relates to our management development, talent assessment and succession planning programs and processes. The Board’s Corporate Responsibility Committee is responsible for monitoring policies and performance related to corporate responsibility, including employment and workers’ rights. In addition, our Executive Leadership Team is regularly engaged in the development and management of key associate programs and initiatives, guiding our culture, associate experience, and talent development programs.

Associate Information
As of January 29, 2023, we employed approximately 31,000 associates, of which approximately 12,000 associates were employed on a part-time basis. Approximately 35% of our associates are employed in the United States. Approximately 63% of our associates are employed in Company-operated retail stores, 31% are assigned to offices and 6% are employed in warehousing and distribution facilities. Our use of seasonal workers is not significant and is largely associated with the Christmas and Lunar New Year selling periods. Approximately 2% of our total associate population is represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by two different unions in the United States. Our collective bargaining agreements generally are for three-year terms. In some international markets, a significant percentage of associates are covered by governmental labor arrangements. Additionally, we have one or more works councils in several European countries. Works councils are organizations that represent workers in respect to certain actions management seeks to take that could have a broad effect on the workers. We believe that our relations with our associates are good. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Our culture is grounded in our values. We seek to cultivate an environment of inclusion, equity and belonging for all to build a better workplace, drive innovation in the marketplace and create positive impacts in our communities. 
We believe we benefit from the unique strengths that each of our associates brings to the workplace, and that a diverse workforce is critical to our long-term success. We strive to improve continuously and make PVH an inclusive work environment through diversity recruitment, development programs, and equitable policies and initiatives. One example is our business resource groups (“BRGs”), which are associate-initiated and associate-led groups that foster an inclusive culture and are intended to contribute to the overall success of the business. We have ten BRGs with 18 chapters globally, most of which are comprised of associates from traditionally underrepresented groups and allies who support them. The BRGs are dedicated to bringing associates together to increase professional and social networks, enhance career development and business acumen, and contribute to building a more inclusive work environment. These groups are supported by our global and regional Inclusion and Diversity (“I&D”) Councils. 
Our Chief Diversity Officer leads the development and implementation of an integrated global I&D strategy and works to enhance our ability to attract, develop, retain and promote diverse talent. The diversity of the Board of Directors continues to be a focus of the Board refreshment program. The seven independent directors who have joined the Board since 2015 include four women, a Southeast Asian and a director who self-identifies as Black/bi-racial and LGBTQIA+. These diverse directors comprise over 50% of our Board, bring with them strong operating and industry experiences, and contribute important and diverse perspectives that help better mirror the overall make-up of our associate and consumer populations. 
Our I&D efforts have been recognized externally over the years, including PVH being named in 2022 to Forbes America’s Best Employers for Diversity and World’s Top Female Friendly Companies, and as one of America’s 100 Most JUST Companies by Forbes magazine and JUST Capital. We also received a score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index in 2022, for the sixth year in a row. We also were ranked ninth on the Fortune Measure Up list of 20 progressive companies in diversity and inclusion in 2021.
Talent Management and Development 
Our talent management and development processes support associate performance, development, talent reviews and succession planning. We regularly review succession plans and conduct assessments to identify talent needs and growth paths for our associates.
Developing our associates is a key strategic priority for us, with the focus on developing leaders and preparing the workforce for the future. PVH University, our global internal learning and development platform, provides engaging and impactful learning content tools and learning opportunities that empower associates to build core competencies and develop skills necessary for improvement and advancement. PVH University programs include, among other things, academies for leadership and our Leadership Behaviors offerings, which are bespoke programs designed to build leadership capabilities for all associates to support our culture and deliver our business strategy. The PVH University library and curriculum includes its digital academy to build enterprise digital and data literacy, as well as to support digital transformation initiatives, and its functional academy to support functional skill building. Additionally, our approach to performance and development is designed to motivate our associates to develop, leverage their strengths and support a coaching and feedback culture.

Compensation, Benefits and Wellness 
We are committed to providing market competitive compensation and benefits, tailoring our offerings to the countries and regions where our associates work to best position our programs locally while recognizing differing levels and types of government-provided and mandated benefits. These benefits include, among other things, corporate wellness programs, retirement plan benefits, flexible and hybrid working arrangements, a global employee assistance program, paid parental and other supportive leaves, recognition programs (for exemplary work, work anniversaries, etc.) and an associate discount program.
To support wellness, we have undertaken initiatives such as closing our offices worldwide in respect of World Mental Health Day and broadening access to physical, mental, and emotional well-being resources, including the wellness applications Headspace and Virgin Pulse. “Work from Anywhere” weeks provide associates with the flexibility to work up to four weeks each year from anywhere. In the United States, an annual “Be You Day” is an addition to paid days off for use as each individual decides, and the third Friday of every month includes a “You Matter Moment,” when calendars are blocked for associates to take PVH University courses, exercise, or engage in other self-directed wellness or enrichment activities.
In regard to compensation, we are committed to achieving pay equity and have developed a global framework of consistent guidelines and practices on compensation. We also engaged third party experts that recently conducted a global study of gender and ethnicity pay equity.
We are committed to supporting our associates in times of need. We have established a Company- and associate-funded Associate Relief Fund that provides grants to eligible associates experiencing personal hardship due to natural disasters, personal calamities and other events. In 2022, we provided financial and operational support to our associates and their families directly impacted by the war in Ukraine.
The health and safety of our associates is of utmost importance to us. In 2022, we continued to closely monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and made decisions that we determined were in the best interest of our associates, as well as their families and the communities in which we operate, particularly in China where COVID-related lockdowns and restrictions continued to be in effect throughout 2022. The vast majority of our office-based associates worked remotely from March 2020 through most of 2021. In 2022, we took a phased approach to returning our office-based associates onsite when permissible. This included modifications to certain of our existing office locations as we adapted to a hybrid work environment that provides flexibility, while maintaining our strong culture of collaboration and connection, in addition to a safe working environment for our associates.
Associate and Community Engagement 
We believe it is critical that our associates are informed and engaged. We communicate frequently with our associates through a variety of methods, including our news app, PVH Insider, which reaches associates around the world; our intranet site, the Thread; town hall meetings on regional, business-wide and global bases; and our regular global PVH Listens survey, as well as pulse surveys. We develop action plans based on the insights from these communications to strengthen programs and address any concerns to enhance associate experience. 
Local community engagement activities exist in all major office locations. Our global philanthropic efforts are led by The PVH Foundation, a nonprofit corporation which supports global, national, and local nonprofits in communities where our associates work and live. PVH’s matching gift program allows our associates to have their philanthropic donations to qualifying organizations matched by The PVH Foundation to increase their impact. Associates are also offered paid time off each year to volunteer with organizations of their choice. 
We encourage you to read our annual Corporate Responsibility Report on our PVH.com corporate website for more detailed information regarding our environmental, social and corporate governance programs and initiatives. None of our corporate website, our Corporate Responsibility Report nor any portions thereof are incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.
