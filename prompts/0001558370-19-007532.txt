 ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
 Overview
 Royal Gold, Inc. (“Royal Gold”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), together with its subsidiaries, is engaged in the business of acquiring and managing precious metal streams, royalties, and similar interests.  We seek to acquire existing stream and royalty interests or to finance projects that are in production or in the development stage in exchange for stream or royalty interests.
 We manage our business under two segments:
 Acquisition and Management of Stream Interests—A metal stream is a purchase agreement that provides, in exchange for an upfront deposit payment, the right to purchase all or a portion of one or more metals produced from a mine, at a price determined for the life of the transaction by the purchase agreement.  As of June 30, 2019, we owned seven stream interests, which are on six producing properties and two development stage properties.  Our stream interests accounted for approximately 72% and 71% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 respectively. We expect stream interests to continue representing a significant proportion of our total revenue.
 Acquisition and Management of Royalty Interests—Royalties are non‑operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to a percentage of revenue or metals produced from the project after deducting specified costs, if any. As of June 30, 2019, we owned royalty interests on 35 producing properties, 14 development stage properties and 129 exploration stage properties, of which we consider 47 to be evaluation stage projects.  We use “evaluation stage” to describe exploration stage properties that contain mineralized material and on which operators are engaged in the search for reserves.  Royalties accounted for approximately 28% and 29% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
 We do not conduct mining operations on the properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests, and except for our interest in the Peak Gold JV, we are not required to contribute to capital costs, exploration costs, environmental costs or other operating costs on those properties. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we engage in a continual review of opportunities to acquire existing stream and royalty interests, to establish new streams on operating mines, to create new stream and royalty interests through the financing of mine development or exploration, or to acquire companies that hold stream and royalty interests.  We currently, and generally at any time, have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review, including, for example, our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities, our analysis of technical, financial, legal and

other confidential information of particular opportunities, submission of indications of interest and term sheets, participation in preliminary discussions and negotiations and involvement as a bidder in competitive processes.
 As discussed in further detail throughout this report, some significant developments to our business during fiscal year 2019 were as follows:

(1) | We settled the long-standing litigation related to the calculation of our royalty at the Voisey’s Bay mine;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | We entered into a silver stream on the Khoemacau Copper Project, a development stage project, located in Botswana;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | We settled the $370 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.875% convertible senior notes due 2019 (“2019 Notes”) in cash; and
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | We increased our calendar year dividend to $1.06 per basic share, which is paid in quarterly installments throughout calendar year 2019. This represents a 6.0% increase compared with the dividend paid during calendar year 2018.

 Fiscal 2019 Business Developments
 Please refer to Item 7, MD&A, for discussion on recent liquidity and capital resource developments.
 Acquisition of Silver Stream on Khoemacau Copper Project
     On February 25, 2019, the Company announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, RGLD Gold AG (“RGLD Gold”), entered into a life of mine purchase and sale agreement with Khoemacau Copper Mining (Pty.) Limited (“KCM”), a majority-owned subsidiary of Cupric Canyon Capital LP (together with all its subsidiaries including KCM, “Cupric”) for the purchase of silver produced from the Khoemacau copper-silver project (“Khoemacau” or the “Project”) located in Botswana and owned by KCM. Cupric Canyon Capital LP is a private company owned by management and funds advised by Global Natural Resource Investments (“GNRI”).  
     Under the purchase and sale agreement, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, RGLD Gold will make advance payments totaling $212 million toward the purchase of 80% of the silver produced from Khoemacau until certain delivery thresholds are met (the “Base Silver Stream”). At Cupric’s option and subject to various conditions, RGLD Gold will make up to an additional $53 million in advance payments for up to the remaining 20% of the silver produced from Khoemacau (the “Option Silver Stream”).  The stream rate will drop to 40% of silver produced from Khoemacau following delivery to RGLD Gold of 32 million silver ounces under the Base Silver Stream, or to 50% of the silver produced from Khoemacau following delivery of 40 million silver ounces to RGLD Gold should Cupric exercise the entire Option Silver Stream.  RGLD Gold will pay a cash price equal to 20% of the spot silver price for each ounce delivered under the Base Silver Stream and Option Silver Stream; however, if Cupric achieves mill expansion throughput levels above 13,000 tonnes per day (30% above current mill design capacity), RGLD Gold will pay a higher ongoing cash price under the Base Silver Stream and Option Silver Stream for silver ounces delivered in excess of specific annual thresholds.
     RGLD Gold’s first advance payment under the Base Silver Stream is expected to occur after $100 million of net new debt and equity funding is spent on Khoemacau.  The $212 million in advance payments to be made under the Base Silver Stream will be made in quarterly installments as project development advances according to the following approximate schedule:  Aggregate $60 million in the third and fourth quarters of calendar 2019, $125 million in calendar 2020, and the balance in calendar 2021.  RGLD Gold will fund advance payments through cash on hand or cash advances from Royal Gold.  Royal Gold will fund any advances made to RGLD Gold largely out of cash flow from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility, as required. 
     Separate from the Base Silver Stream and Option Silver Stream, and subject to various conditions, RGLD Gold will make up to $25 million available to Cupric toward the end of development of Khoemacau under a subordinated debt facility.  Any amounts drawn by Cupric under the debt facility will carry interest at LIBOR + 11% and have a term of seven years.  RGLD Gold will have the right to force repayment of the debt facility upon certain events.
     Background on Khoemacau
     Khoemacau is a copper-silver project located in the Kalahari copper belt, in a sparsely populated region of northwestern Botswana in the Kalahari Desert.  Khoemacau is made up of over 4,040 square kilometers of mineral concessions from Cupric’s acquisition of Hana Mining Ltd. in 2013, as well as additional mineral concessions and a plant and associated infrastructure (the “Boseto Mill”) acquired by Cupric out of the receivership of Discovery Metals Inc. in 2015.  Cupric

consolidated the land position and infrastructure and has focused on exploration and development of the Zone 5 orebody within the land package.  
     Cupric plans to develop Zone 5 as three separate underground mines, each planned to produce approximately 1.2 million tonnes of ore per year over the first five years.  Each of the mines is expected to have its own independent ramp access and operate over a strike length of approximately 1,000 meters, extracting ore using conventional sub-level open stoping.  Cupric’s plan provides for the ore to be trucked approximately 35 kilometers to the Boseto Mill, which is to be refurbished and enhanced to process approximately 10,000 tonnes of ore per day.  Processing will be conventional sulfide flotation via three stage crushing, ball milling and flotation, which Cupric expects will produce a high-quality copper concentrate grading approximately 40% copper for shipment to international smelters.  Cupric expects that power will be sourced from an expansion to the existing power grid currently under construction by Botswana Power Corporation, and that existing diesel generation capacity remaining from previous operations will be used as backup power.  Water is expected to be supplied from three borefields along with mine dewatering.
     On July 18, 2019, Cupric announced financial closing for a total financing package of $650 million for Khoemacau, including a further $15 million equity investment from funds advised by GNRI, a new $70 million equity investment from Resource Capital Fund Investment VII LP, a new $275 million secured debt facility from Red Kite Mine Finance, and the RGLD Gold purchase and sale agreement and debt facility.
     Voisey’s Bay
     The royalty on production of nickel, copper, cobalt and other minerals from the Voisey’s Bay mine in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada is directly owned by the Labrador Nickel Royalty Limited Partnership (“LNRLP”), in which the Company’s wholly-owned indirect subsidiary is the general partner and 90% owner. The remaining 10% interest in LNRLP is owned by a subsidiary of Altius Minerals Corporation.
     On September 13, 2018, LNRLP entered into an agreement with Vale Canada Limited and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Parties”) to comprehensively settle long-standing litigation related to calculation of the royalty on the sale of all concentrates produced from the Voisey’s Bay mine.  
     The Parties agreed to a new method for calculating the royalty in respect of concentrates processed at Vale’s Long Harbour Processing Plant (“LHPP”), which became effective for all Voisey’s Bay mine production after April 1, 2018.  Under the terms of the settlement, Royal Gold expects the 3% royalty rate will apply to approximately 50% of the gross metal value in the concentrates at the nickel, copper and cobalt prices prevailing at the time of settlement.  As those metal prices rise or fall, the percentage of gross metal value in the concentrates applicable to the royalty would correspondingly increase or decrease.
     During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Company recognized approximately $11.9 million (which includes the 10% non-controlling interest) in royalty revenue attributable to the Voisey’s Bay royalty.  Royalty payments for each quarter are due 45 days after quarter-end.  The Company anticipates recognizing revenue for the Voisey’s Bay royalty in the period in which metal production occurs, based on information provided by the operator.  If information is not received timely from the operator, the Company may estimate Voisey’s Bay royalty revenue based on available or historical information.  Refer to Note 6 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our revenue recognition.
     Peak Gold JV 
     On September 24, 2018, the Company announced that the Peak Gold JV, of which our Royal Alaska, LLC subsidiary owns a 40% interest, completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) on the Peak Gold Project located near Tok, Alaska.  The PEA contemplates on a preliminary basis an open pit mining operation with positive economics at base case gold and silver prices.  While the Company remains committed to advancing the Peak Gold Project, it will continue to review and evaluate strategic alternatives for its ownership in the project that more closely align with its core business. 
     Royal Gold also owns two net smelter return royalties on the Peak Gold Project.

 Please see “Operations in foreign countries or other sovereign jurisdictions are subject to many risks, which could decrease our revenues,” under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this report for a description of the risks attendant to foreign operations.
 Our financial results are primarily tied to the price of gold and, to a lesser extent, the price of silver and copper, together with the amounts of production from our producing stage stream and royalty interests.  During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, Royal Gold derived approximately 87% of its revenue from precious metals (including 78% from gold and 9% from silver), 9% from copper and 4% from other minerals.  The price of gold, silver, copper and other metals have fluctuated widely in recent years.  The marketability and the price of metals are influenced by numerous factors beyond the control of the Company and significant declines in the price of gold, silver or copper could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. 
 Competition
 The mining industry in general and streaming and royalty segments in particular are very competitive.  We compete with other streaming and royalty companies, mine operators, and financial buyers in efforts to acquire existing streaming and royalty interests, and with the lenders, investors, and streaming and royalty companies providing financing to operators of mineral properties in our efforts to create new streaming and royalty interests.  Our competitors may be larger than we are and may have greater resources and access to capital than we have.  Key competitive factors in the stream and royalty acquisition and financing business include the ability to identify and evaluate potential opportunities, transaction structure and consideration, and access to capital. Regulation
 Operators of the mines that are subject to our stream and royalty interests must comply with numerous environmental, mine safety, land use, waste disposal, remediation and public health laws and regulations promulgated by federal, state, provincial and local governments in the United States, Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Mexico, and other countries where we hold interests. Although we are not responsible as a stream or royalty interest owner for ensuring compliance with these laws and regulations, failure by the operators of the mines on which we have stream and royalty interests to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits can result in injunctive action, orders to suspend or cease operations, damages and civil and criminal penalties on the operators.
