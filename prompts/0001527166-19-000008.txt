ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
We are one of the world’s largest and most diversified multi-product global investment firms. We advise an array of specialized investment funds and other investment vehicles that predominantly invest across the spectrum of private capital asset classes, including private equity, credit, energy and power, real estate, and infrastructure. Our teams invest across a range of industries, geographies, asset classes and investment strategies and seek to deliver attractive returns for our investors. Since our firm was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1987, we have grown to become one of the leading global investment firms with more than $216 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2018. We have more than 1,650 employees, including 637 investment professionals in 31 offices across six continents, and we serve more than 1,950 active carry fund investors from 90 countries. Across our Corporate Private Equity (“CPE”) and Real Assets segments, as of December 31, 2018, we had investments in 276 active portfolio companies that employ approximately 950,000 people. In general, we have more investment professionals, offices, investment funds and investments across our platform than many of our peers. We have structured our firm in this manner to provide our fund investors with a more diverse product set tailored to individual investing decisions, and with investment capabilities that utilize deeper teams with a broader global reach. This structure does increase our costs of doing business. 
For the past thirty-one years, our firm has been guided by several fundamental tenets:


• | Excellence in Investing. Our primary goal is to invest wisely and create value for our investors. We strive to generate superior investment returns by combining deep industry expertise, a global network of local investment teams who can leverage extensive firm-wide resources and a consistent and disciplined investment process.


• | Alignment with our Fund Investors and Other Stakeholders. We seek to continually align our interests with our fund investors and other stakeholders. This commitment is a core component of our firm culture and informs every aspect of our business.


• | Expansion of our Platform. We innovate continuously to expand our investment capabilities through the creation or acquisition of new asset-, sector- and regional-focused strategies in order to provide our fund investors a variety of investment options.


• | Investment in the Firm. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in hiring and retaining a deep talent pool of investment professionals and in creating an efficient global infrastructure to ensure that we are providing our investors with world-class investment expertise and the customized service they require.


• | Unified Culture. We seek to leverage the local market insights and operational capabilities that we have developed across our global platform through a unified culture we call “One Carlyle.” Our culture emphasizes collaboration and sharing of knowledge and expertise across the firm to create value. We believe our collaborative approach enhances our ability to analyze investments, deploy capital and improve the performance of our portfolio companies. We also believe our One Carlyle culture provides us with a competitive advantage in this challenging environment. 

During 2018, we worked to further our fundamental tenets by focusing on investing wisely and driving asset appreciation to create value for our investors, making significant progress toward our goal of raising $100 billion in new capital commitments during our four-year fundraising plan ending in December 2019 and building a premier global credit platform. 
Operational and strategic highlights for our firm for 2018 include:


• | During 2018, we raised more than $33 billion in new commitments across our platform, including our three flagship buyout funds, bringing the total gross commitments raised since 2016 to $90 billion.


• | During 2018, we made investments through our carry funds of more than $22 billion, a record level, and we realized proceeds of approximately $24 billion.


• | During 2018, the value of our carry fund portfolio increased by approximately 9%.

• | In 2018, we acquired a 19.9% interest in Fortitude Group Holdings, LLC ("Fortitude Holdings"). Fortitude Holdings owns 100% of the outstanding common shares of Fortitude Reinsurance Company Ltd., a Bermuda domiciled reinsurer (collectively, "Fortitude Re", f/k/a "DSA Re") established to reinsure a portfolio of AIG's legacy life, annuity and property and casualty liabilities. In connection with the investment, we entered into a strategic asset management relationship with Fortitude Re pursuant to which Fortitude Re, together with certain AIG-affiliated ceding companies it has reinsured, will commit to allocate assets in certain of our asset management strategies and vehicles across multiple segments.


• | In 2018, we continued to build our global credit business. We acquired Apollo Aviation Group, a global commercial aviation investment and servicing firm and rebranded the business as Carlyle Aviation Partners. Carlyle Aviation Partners is part of our Global Credit segment.


• | In September 2018, we issued $350 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.650% senior notes due in 2048, repurchased $250 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 3.875% senior notes due in 2023 and prepaid the $109 million amount outstanding under the promissory note we previously issued to Barclays Natural Resource Investments.


• | We further aligned our interests with our fund investors and other stakeholders as Carlyle, our senior Carlyle professionals, advisors and other professionals increased commitments to our investment funds by over $0.9 billion during the year for a total cumulative commitment of $12.8 billion as of December 31, 2018.


• | Each of our segments continued to leverage the One Carlyle platform to take advantage of economies of scale and we continue to work across the firm to develop different products for our fund investors.

Operational and strategic highlights for our four business segments for 2018 include: 

• | CPE:


◦ | CPE successfully completed fundraising for its latest generation U.S. and Asia buyout funds, and made significant progress on our latest European buyout fund. During 2018, we raised $17 billion in new capital commitments for our CPE funds.

◦ | During 2018, we invested more than $5 billion in our Real Assets segment. Of this amount, we invested approximately $2 billion to acquire or develop real estate properties, primarily in the U.S. across multiple sectors, including multifamily, commercial, senior living and for-sale residential properties. We also invested in oil and gas transactions and power generating facilities in the United States. In total, our natural resources platform invested more than $3 billion in 2018. 


◦ | We realized proceeds of more than $5 billion for our Real Assets carry fund investors in 2018 and exited (fully or partially) a number of assets.

Global Credit:

4


◦ | We held a final closing on our second business development company ("BDC"), TCG BDC II, Inc., with total commitments of approximately $1.2 billion, raised over $500 million in separately managed accounts focused on direct lending and brought total commitments to our credit opportunities fund to over $1.1 billion. In our collateralized loan obligation ("CLO") business, we closed five new CLOs in the U.S., and two new CLOs in Europe in 2018 in addition to multiple resets and refinancings, with approximately $24 billion of AUM across all of our CLOs at December 31, 2018. We launched OFI Carlyle Private Credit, a joint venture with OppenheimerFunds, providing retail investors access to less liquid credit strategies across the Global Credit platform. In total, more than $6 billion in new capital commitments for our Global Credit products were raised during 2018, and overall AUM, including Carlyle Aviation Partners, increased to more than $44 billion. 

Investment Solutions: 

◦ | During 2018, we deployed approximately $5 billion in investments across our platform. Our portfolio appreciated 19% during the year.

This program invests in the real estate secondaries market globally, providing liquidity to investors in private equity funds and other partnership structures.


◦ | Our exit activity in our Investment Solutions segment was robust this year, realizing proceeds of more than $9 billion for our Investment Solutions investors.

Business Segments
We operate our business across four segments: (1) CPE, (2) Real Assets, (3) Global Credit and (4) Investment Solutions. Information about our segments should be read together with “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Corporate Private Equity
Our CPE segment, established in 1990 with our first U.S. buyout fund, advises our buyout and middle market and growth capital funds that pursue a wide variety of investments of different sizes and growth profiles. Our 33 active CPE funds are each carry funds. They are organized and operated by geography or industry and are advised by teams of local professionals who live and work in the markets where they invest. In our CPE segment we also have 65 active external co-investment entities. We believe this diversity of funds and entities allows us to deploy more targeted and specialized investment expertise and strategies and offers our fund investors the ability to tailor their investment choices.
Our CPE teams have two primary areas of focus:


• | Buyout Funds. Our buyout teams advise a diverse group of 23 active funds that invest in transactions that focus either on a particular geography (e.g., United States, Europe, Asia, Japan, MENA, Sub-Saharan Africa or South America) or a particular industry, (e.g., financial services). In 2018, we successfully completed fundraising for our latest generation U.S. and Asia buyout funds, and made significant progress on our latest European buyout fund. We invested $10.6 billion in new and follow-on investments through our buyout funds. As of December 31, 2018, our buyout funds had, in the aggregate, approximately $75 billion in AUM. 


• | Middle Market and Growth Capital. Our 10 active middle market and growth capital funds are advised by regionally-focused teams in the United States, Europe and Asia, with each team generally focused on private equity investments in middle-market and lower middle-market companies consistent with specific regional investment considerations. The investment mandate for our middle market and growth capital funds is to seek out companies with the potential for growth, strategic redirection and operational improvements. These funds typically do not invest in early stage or venture-type investments. We invested $0.6 billion in new and follow-on investments through our middle market and growth capital funds. As of December 31, 2018, our middle market and growth funds had, in the aggregate, approximately $6 billion in AUM.

From inception through December 31, 2018, our CPE segment has invested approximately $98 billion in 626 investments. Of that total, we have invested 58% in 299 investments in North and South America, 25% in 157 investments in 
5

Europe, the Middle East and Africa and 18% in 170 investments in the Asia-Pacific region. We have fully realized 443 of these investments, meaning that our funds have completely exited, and no longer own an interest in, those investments.
The following table presents certain data about our CPE segment as of December 31, 2018 (dollar amounts in billions; amounts invested include co-investments).

$81 | 37% | $62 | 183 | 33 | $34 | 275 | $98 | 626 

Real Assets
Our Real Assets segment, established in 1997 with our first U.S. real estate fund, advises our 26 active carry funds focused on real estate, infrastructure and energy and natural resources (including power) and also includes the three NGP Predecessor Funds and four NGP Carry Funds that are advised by NGP. This segment pursues investment opportunities across a diverse array of tangible assets, such as residential and retail properties, senior living facilities, industrial properties, self storage properties, office building and hotels, as well as oil and gas exploration and production, midstream, refining and marketing, power generation, pipelines, wind farms, refineries, airports, toll roads, transportation, water utility and agriculture, as well as the companies providing services or otherwise related to them. 
Our Real Assets teams have two primary areas of focus:


• | Real Estate. Our ten active real estate funds pursue real estate investment opportunities in Europe and the United States and generally focus on acquiring single-property assets rather than large-cap companies with real estate portfolios. Our team of 128 real estate investment professionals has made more than 950 investments in 434 cities/metropolitan statistical areas around the world as of December 31, 2018, including residential and retail properties, senior living facilities, industrial properties, self storage properties, office buildings and hotels. In 2018, we held a final close on our eighth opportunistic U.S. real estate fund and held additional closings on our re-launched Europe realty fund and Core Plus real estate fund. As of December 31, 2018, our real estate funds had, in the aggregate, approximately $19 billion in AUM. 


• | Energy and Natural Resources. Our energy and natural resources activities focus on buyouts, growth capital investments and strategic joint ventures in the midstream, upstream, energy and oilfield services sectors, the renewable and alternative sectors and the power and infrastructure industries around the world. Historically, we conducted our energy investing activities jointly with Riverstone, co-advising three funds with approximately $4 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2018 (we refer to these energy funds as our “Legacy Energy funds”). Currently, we conduct our North American energy investing through our partnership with NGP, an Irving, Texas-based energy investor. NGP advises seven funds with more than $14 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2018. Through our strategic partnership with NGP, we are entitled to 55% of the management fee-related revenue of the NGP entities that serve as advisors to the NGP Energy Funds, and an allocation of income related to the carried interest received by the fund general partners of the NGP Carry Funds. Our power team focuses on investment opportunities in the North American power generation sector. As of December 31, 2018, the power team managed more than $2 billion in AUM through two funds. Our international energy investment team focuses on investments across the energy value chain outside of North America. As of December 31, 2018, the international energy team managed more than $5 billion in AUM through two funds. In 2018, we held additional closings for our global infrastructure fund focused on infrastructure assets, business and investments in global developed markets. As of December 31, 2018, the global infrastructure team managed more than $1 billion in AUM through two funds. We have also invested previously in North American infrastructure companies and assets. 

Our Real Assets carry funds, including Carlyle-advised co-investment vehicles, have, from inception through December 31, 2018, invested on a global basis $54 billion in 1,137 investments, including 108 active portfolio companies. Of that total, we have invested 78% in 959 investments in North and South America, 17% in 125 investments in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and 5% in 53 investments in the Asia-Pacific region. We have fully realized 711 of these investments, meaning that our funds have completely exited, and no longer own an interest in, those investments.

Global Credit
Our Global Credit segment, established in 1999 with our first high yield fund, advises a group of 59 active funds that pursue investment strategies including loans & structured credit, direct lending, opportunistic credit, energy credit, distressed credit, and aviation finance. Taken together, these various capital sources provide the opportunity for Carlyle to offer highly customizable and creative financing solutions to borrowers to meet their specific capital needs. In 2018, we hired several new senior investment professionals to expand Global Credit's investment breadth and geographical presence. In 2018, we acquired a 19.9% interest in Fortitude Re, a Bermuda domiciled reinsurer established to reinsure a portfolio of AIG's legacy life, annuity and property and casualty liabilities. We plan to continue to pursue new initiatives from our Global Credit platform that will continue to expand our capabilities in credit. 
Primary areas of focus for our Global Credit platform include:


• | Loans and Structured Credit. Our structured credit funds invest primarily in performing senior secured bank loans through structured vehicles and other investment vehicles. In 2018, in addition to multiple resets and refinancings, we closed five new U.S. CLOs and two CLOs in Europe with a total of $2.7 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively, of AUM at December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our loans and structured credit team advised 44 structured credit funds and two carry funds in the United States, Europe and Asia totaling, in the aggregate, approximately $25 billion in AUM.


• | Direct Lending. Our direct lending business includes our BDCs that invest primarily in middle market first-lien loans (which include unitranche, "first out" and "last out" loans) and second-lien loans of middle-market companies, typically defined as companies with annual EBITDA ranging from $10 million to $100 million, that lack access to the broadly syndicated loan and bond markets. In 2018, we expanded our direct lending capabilities by adding personnel dedicated to asset based lending transactions. As of December 31, 2018, our direct lending investment team advised three funds consisting of two BDCs and one corporate mezzanine fund, totaling, in the aggregate, more than $4 billion in AUM. 


• | Opportunistic Credit. Our opportunistic credit team invests primarily in highly-structured and privately-negotiated capital solutions supporting corporate borrowers through secured loans, senior subordinated debt, mezzanine debt, convertible notes, and other debt like instruments, as well as preferred and common equity in such borrowers. The team will also look to invest in special situations (i.e., event-driven opportunities that exhibit hybrid credit and equity features) as well as market dislocations (i.e., primary and secondary market investments in liquid debt instruments that arise as a result of temporary market volatility). As of December 31, 2018, our opportunistic credit team advised one fund totaling, in the aggregate, approximately $1 billion in AUM. 


• | Energy Credit. Our Energy credit team invests primarily in privately-negotiated mezzanine debt investments in North American energy and power projects and companies. As of December 31, 2018, our energy credit team advised two funds with approximately $5 billion in AUM. 


• | Distressed Credit. Our distressed credit funds generally invest in liquid and illiquid securities and obligations, including secured debt, senior and subordinated unsecured debt, convertible debt obligations, preferred stock and public and private equity of financially distressed companies in defensive and asset-rich industries. In certain investments, our funds may seek to restructure pre-reorganization debt claims into controlling positions in the equity of the reorganized companies. As of December 31, 2018, our distressed credit team advised three funds totaling, in the aggregate, more than $3 billion in AUM.

• | Aircraft Financing and Servicing. Carlyle Aviation Partners, Ltd. ("Carlyle Aviation Partners", formerly Apollo Aviation Group) is our multi-strategy investment platform that is engaged in commercial aviation aircraft financing and investment and providing investment management services related to the commercial aviation industry. As of December 31, 2018, Carlyle Aviation Partners had approximately $6 billion in AUM across three active carry funds, securitization vehicles and liquid strategies. 


• | Capital Solutions. Carlyle Capital Solutions ("CCS") is our loan syndication and capital markets business that launched in 2018. The primary focus of Carlyle Capital Solutions is to originate and syndicate loans and underwrite securities of both third parties and Carlyle portfolio companies.

The following table presents certain data about our Global Credit segment as of December 31, 2018 (dollar amounts in billions). 

    
AUM | % of TotalAUM | Fee-earningAUM | ActiveFunds | InvestmentProfessionals
$44 | 21% | $35 | 59 | 113 

Investment Solutions
Our Investment Solutions segment, established in 2011, provides comprehensive investment opportunities and resources for our investors and clients to build private equity and real estate portfolios through fund of funds, secondary purchases of existing portfolios and managed co-investment programs. Investment Solutions executes these activities through AlpInvest, one of the world’s largest investors in private equity, and Metropolitan, one of the largest managers of indirect investments in global real estate. 
The primary areas of focus for our Investment Solutions teams include:

• | Private Equity Fund Investments. Our fund of funds vehicles advised by AlpInvest make investment commitments directly to buyout, growth capital, venture and other alternative asset funds advised by other general partners (“portfolio funds”). As of December 31, 2018, AlpInvest advised 78 vehicles totaling, in the aggregate, approximately $24 billion in AUM.


• | Private Equity Co-investments. AlpInvest invests alongside other private equity and mezzanine funds in which it or certain AlpInvest limited partners typically has a primary fund investment throughout Europe, North America and Asia. These investments are generally made when an investment opportunity is too large for a particular fund and the sponsor of the fund therefore seeks to raise additional “co-investment” capital from sources such as AlpInvest. As of December 31, 2018, our co-investment programs were conducted through 58 vehicles totaling, in the aggregate, more than $8 billion in AUM.


• | Private Equity Secondary Investments. Funds managed by AlpInvest acquire limited partnership interests in the secondary market. Private equity investors who desire to sell or restructure their pre-existing investment commitments to a fund may negotiate to sell the fund interests to AlpInvest. In this manner, AlpInvest’s secondary investments team provides liquidity and restructuring alternatives for third-party private equity investors. As of December 31, 2018, our secondary investments program was conducted through 57 vehicles totaling, in the aggregate, more than $11 billion in AUM. 


• | Real Estate Funds of Funds and Co-Secondary Investments. The principal strategic focus in our real estate funds is on value add/opportunistic real estate investments through direct commitments to more than 100 highly-focused, specialist real estate managers across the globe. As of December 31, 2018, we advised 32 real estate vehicles with more than $2 billion in AUM. We also focus on real estate secondaries and co-investments.

The following table presents certain data about our Investment Solutions segment as of December 31, 2018 (dollar amounts in billions). See “— Structure and Operation of Our Investment Funds — Incentive Arrangements/Fee Structure” in this Item 1 for a discussion of the arrangements with the historical owners and management of AlpInvest regarding the allocation of carried interest in respect of the historical investments of and the historical and certain future commitments to our AlpInvest carry fund vehicles.

$46 | 21% | $29 | 225 | $16 | 96 | $67 


(1) | Under our arrangements with the historical owners and management team of AlpInvest, we generally do not retain any carried interest in respect of the historical investments and commitments to our AlpInvest carry fund vehicles that existed as of July 1, 2011 (including any options to increase any such commitments exercised after such date). We are entitled to 15% or, in some cases, 40% of the carried interest in respect of commitments from the historical owners of AlpInvest for the period between 2011 and 2020 and 40% of the carried interest in respect of all other commitments (including all future commitments from third parties). 

Investment Approach
Corporate Private Equity
The investment approach of our CPE teams is generally characterized as follows:


• | Consistent and Disciplined Investment Process. We believe our successful investment track record is the result, in part, of a consistent and disciplined application of our investment process. Investment opportunities for our CPE funds are initially sourced and evaluated by one or more of our deal teams. Deal teams consistently strive to be creative and look for deals in which we can leverage Carlyle's competitive advantages, sector experience and the global One Carlyle platform. The due diligence and transaction review process places a special emphasis on, among other considerations, the reputation of a target company’s shareholders and management, the company’s size and sensitivity of cash flow generation, the business sector and competitive risks, the portfolio fit, exit risks and other key factors specific to a particular investment. In evaluating each deal, we consider what expertise or experience (i.e., the “Carlyle Edge”) we can bring to the transaction to enhance value for our investors. Each investment opportunity must secure approval from the investment committee of the applicable investment fund to move forward. To help ensure consistency, we utilize a standard investment committee process across our corporate private equity funds. The investment committee approval process involves a detailed review of the transaction and investment thesis, business, risk factors and diligence issues, as well as financial models. 


• | Geographic- and Industry-Focused. We have developed a global network of local investment teams with deep local insight into the areas in which they invest and have adopted an industry-focused approach to investing. Our extensive network of global investment professionals has the knowledge, experience and relationships on a local level that allow them to identify and take advantage of opportunities that may be unavailable to firms that do not have our global reach and resources. We believe that our global platform helps enhance all stages of the investment process, including by facilitating faster and more effective diligence, a deeper understanding of global industry trends and priority access to the capital markets. We have particular industry expertise in aerospace, defense and government services, consumer and retail, financial services, healthcare, industrial, telecom, media and technology and transportation. As a result, we believe that our in-depth knowledge of specific industries improves our ability to source and create transactions, conduct effective and more informed due diligence, develop strong relationships with management teams and use contacts and relationships within these industries to drive value creation. 


• | Variable Deal Sizes and Creative Structures. We believe that having the resources to complete investments of varying sizes provides us with the ability to enhance investment returns while providing for prudent industry, geographic and size diversification. Our teams are staffed not only to effectively pursue large transactions, but also other transactions of varying sizes. We often invest in smaller companies and this has allowed us to obtain greater diversity across our entire portfolio. Additionally, we may undertake large, strategic minority investments with certain control elements or private investment in public equity (PIPE) transactions in large companies with a clear exit strategy. In certain jurisdictions around the world, we may make investments with little or no debt financing and seek alternative structures to opportunistically pursue transactions. We generally seek to obtain board representation and typically appoint our investment professionals and advisors to represent us on the boards 

9

of the companies in which we invest. Where our funds, either alone or as part of a consortium, are not the controlling investor, we typically, subject to applicable regulatory requirements, acquire significant voting and other control rights with a view to securing influence over the conduct of the business.

• | Driving Value Creation. Our CPE teams seek to make investments in portfolio companies in which our particular strengths and resources may be employed to their best advantage. Typically, as part of a CPE investment, our investment teams will prepare and execute a value creation plan that is developed during a thorough due diligence effort and draws on the deep resources available across our global platform, specifically relying on:


◦ | Reach: Our global team and global presence enables us to support international expansion efforts and global supply chain initiatives.


◦ | Expertise: Our deep bench of investment professionals and industry specialists provide extensive sector-specific knowledge and local market expertise. Our investment teams benefit from best-in-class support services and infrastructure provided through the global Carlyle organization. Carlyle’s overall infrastructure and support services cover the full range of administrative functions, including fund management, accounting, legal and compliance, human resources, information technology, tax, and external affairs. 


◦ | Insight: We engage more than 40 operating executives and advisors as independent consultants to work with our investment teams, provide board-level governance and support and advise our portfolio companies. These operating executives and advisors are former CEOs and other high-level executives of some of the world’s most successful corporations and currently sit on the boards of directors of a diverse mix of companies. We use this collective group of operating executives to provide special expertise to support specific value creation initiatives.


◦ | Data: The goal of our research function is to extract as much information as possible from our portfolio about the current state of the economy and its likely evolution over the near-to-medium term. Our CPE investment portfolio includes over 175 active portfolio companies as of December 31, 2018, across a diverse range of industries and geographies that each generate multiple data points (e.g., orders, shipments, production volumes, occupancy rates, bookings). By evaluating this data on a systematic basis, we work to identify the data with the highest correlation with macroeconomic data and map observed movements in the portfolio to anticipated variation in the economy, including changes in growth rates across industries and geographies. We incorporate this proprietary data into our investment portfolio management strategy and exit decisions on an ongoing basis. We believe this robust data gives us an advantage over our peers who do not have as large of a global reach. 


◦ | Information Technology Resources: Carlyle has established an Information Technology (“IT”) capability that contributes to due diligence, portfolio company strategy and portfolio company operations. The capability includes dedicated information technology and business process resources, including assistance with portfolio company risk assessments and enhanced deal analytics.


◦ | Pursuing Best Exit Alternatives. In determining when to exit an investment, our private equity teams consider whether a portfolio company has achieved its objectives, the financial returns and the appropriate timing in industry cycles and company development to strive for the optimal value. The fund’s investment committee approves all exit decisions.

Real Assets
Our Real Assets business includes investments in real estate assets, infrastructure and energy and natural resources (including power) companies and projects. The investment approach of the teams advising the international energy, power and infrastructure funds is similar to that of our CPE funds.
Generally, the investment approach of our real estate teams is characterized as follows:


• | Pursue Single Asset Transactions. In general, our U.S. real estate funds have focused on single asset transactions. We follow this approach in the U.S. because we believe that pursuing single assets enables us to better understand the factors that contribute to the fundamental value of each property, mitigate concentration risk, establish appropriate asset-by-asset capital structures and maintain governance over major property-level decisions. In addition, the direct ownership of assets typically enables us to effectively employ an active asset management

10

approach and reduce financing and operating risk, while increasing the visibility of factors that affect the overall returns of the investment. In the U.S., we plan to continue to focus on single asset transactions in both our opportunistic and core plus investment strategies. Outside the U.S., we continue to opportunistically invest in the European markets. 

• | Seek out Strong Joint Venture Partners or Managers. Where appropriate, we seek out joint venture partners or managers with significant operational expertise and/or deal sourcing capability. For each joint venture, we design structures and terms to align interests and provide situationally appropriate incentives, often including, for example, the subordination of the joint venture partner’s equity and profits interest to that of a fund, giveback provisions and/or profits escrow accounts in favor of a fund and exclusivity. We also typically structure positions with control or veto rights over major decisions.


• | Source Deals Directly. Our teams endeavor to establish “market presence” in our target geographies where we have a history of operating in local markets and benefit from extensive long-term relationships with developers, corporate real estate owners, institutional investors and private owners. These relationships have resulted in our ability to source a large number of investments on a direct negotiated basis.


• | Focus on Sector-Specific Strategies. Our real estate funds focus on specific sectors and markets in areas where we believe the fundamentals are sound and dynamic capital markets allow for identification of assets whose value is not fully recognized. The real estate funds we advise have invested according to strategies established in several main sectors: residential, senior living, industrial, self storage, retail, warehouse and logistics, office and hotel.


• | Actively Manage our Real Estate Investments. Our real estate investments often require active management to uncover and create value. Accordingly, we have put in place experienced local asset management teams to assist in communicating with operating partners and property managers on a regular basis. These teams add value through analysis and execution of capital expenditure programs, development projects, lease negotiations, operating cost reduction programs and asset dispositions. The asset management teams work closely with the other real estate professionals to effectively formulate and implement strategic management plans.


• | Manage the Exit of Investments. We believe that “exit management” is as important as traditional asset management in order to take full advantage of the typically short windows of opportunity created by temporary imbalances in capital market forces that affect real estate. In determining when to exit an investment, our real estate teams consider whether an investment has fulfilled its strategic plan, the depth of the market and generally prevailing industry conditions. Throughout our investment holding period, our investment professionals remain actively engaged in and focused on managing the steps needed to proceed to a successful exit. 

Our energy and natural resources activities primarily focus on four areas: international energy, North American energy, power and infrastructure.


• | International Energy Investing. Our international energy team pursues investment opportunities in oil and gas exploration and production, midstream, oilfield services and refining and marketing in Europe, Africa, Latin America and Asia. Seeking to take advantage of the lack of capital in the international energy market, we pursue transactions where we have a distinctive competitive advantage and can create tangible value for the companies in which we invest, through industry specialization, deployment of human capital and access to our global network. In seeking to build a geographically-diverse international energy portfolio, we focus on cash-generating opportunities, with a particular focus on proven reserves and production, and strategically seek to enhance the efficiency of the portfolio through exploration, infrastructure or operating improvements. We may pursue investment opportunities of variable size, and utilize alternative structures and sources of capital, including incorporating blank check companies to invest alongside our funds to effectively pursue large transactions. 


• | North American Energy Investing. We conduct our current North American energy investing through our strategic partnership with NGP, an Irving, Texas-based energy investment firm that focuses on investments across a range of energy and natural resource assets, including oil and gas resources, oilfield services, pipelines and processing, as well as agricultural investments and properties. NGP seeks to align itself with “owner-managers” who are invested in the enterprise, have a top-tier technical team and who have a proprietary edge that differentiates their business plan. NGP strives to establish a portfolio of platform companies to grow through acquisitions and development and provides financial and strategic support and access to additional capital at the lowest cost. We do not control or manage the NGP Energy Funds that are advised by NGP. NGP is managed by its senior leadership.

• | Power Investing. Our power team focuses on investment opportunities in the North American power generation sector. Leveraging the expertise of the investment professionals at Cogentrix Power Management L.L.C., one of our portfolio companies, the team seeks investments where it can obtain direct or indirect operational control to facilitate the implementation of technical enhancements. We seek to capitalize on secular trends and to identify assets where engineering and technical expertise, in addition to a strong management team, can facilitate performance.


• | Global Infrastructure Investing. Our global infrastructure team pursues investments across a variety of sectors and geographies. The fund team targets investment opportunities primarily domiciled in developed markets with strong commercial systems and rule of law. The team utilizes a value-added approach to transaction sourcing, diligence and asset management and seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for the fund. The team seeks to enhance the value of its investments through strategic and operational impact including risk management techniques utilized across Carlyle's global corporate private equity and natural resources investment businesses. The goal of this approach is to increase the profitability of the investments, increase cash flow yield and enhance the attractiveness of the asset for ultimate exit to a trade buyer, core infrastructure buyer or the public markets. 

Global Credit
The investment approach of our Global Credit platform is generally characterized as follows:


• | Source Investment Opportunities. Our Global Credit team sources investment opportunities from both the primary and secondary markets through our global network and strong relationships with the financial community. We typically target portfolio companies that have a demonstrated track record of profitability, market leadership in their respective niche, predictable cash flow, a definable competitive advantage and products or services that are value added to its customer base.


• | Conduct Fundamental Due Diligence and Perform Capital Structure Analyses. After an opportunity is identified, our Global Credit investment professionals conduct fundamental due diligence to determine the relative value of the potential investment and capital structure analyses to determine credit worthiness. Our due diligence approach typically incorporates meetings with management, company facility visits, discussions with industry analysts and consultants and an in-depth examination of financial results and projections. In conducting due diligence, our Global Credit team employs an integrated, cross platform approach with industry-dedicated credit research analysts and non-investment grade expertise across the capital structure. Our Global Credit team also seeks to leverage resources from across the firm, utilizing information obtained from our more than 275 active portfolio companies and lending relationships with over 800 companies, 12 credit industry research analysts, and in-house government affairs and economic research teams. 


• | Evaluation of Macroeconomic Factors. Our Global Credit team evaluates technical factors such as supply and demand, the market’s expectations surrounding a company and the existence of short- and long-term value creation or destruction catalysts. Inherent in all stages of credit evaluation is a determination of the likelihood of potential catalysts emerging, such as corporate reorganizations, recapitalizations, asset sales, changes in a company’s liquidity and mergers and acquisitions.


• | Risk Minimization. Our Global Credit team seeks to make investments in capital structures to enable companies to both expand and weather downturns and/or below-plan performance. The team works to structure investments with strong financial covenants, frequent reporting requirements and board representation, if possible. Through board representation or observation rights, our Global Credit team works to provide a consultative, interactive approach to equity sponsors and management partners as part of the overall portfolio management process.

Investment Solutions
Our Investment Solutions team aims to apply a wide array of capabilities to help clients meet their investment objectives. The investment approach of our Investment Solutions platform is generally characterized as follows:

• | Well-informed, Disciplined Investment Process: We follow a disciplined, highly-selective investment process and seek to achieve diversification by deploying capital across economic cycles, segments and investment styles. Our integrated and collaborative culture across our strategies, reinforced by investment in information technology solutions, provides deep insight into fund manager portfolios and operations to support our rigorous selection process. 

12


• | Proactive Sourcing: AlpInvest Partners' and Metropolitan Real Estate's extensive network of private equity and real estate managers across the globe positions us to identify investment opportunities that may be unavailable to other investors. Our investment strategy is defined by a strong belief that the best opportunities are found in areas that are less subject to competitive pressures. As a result, our teams actively seek out proprietary investments that would otherwise be difficult for our investors to access.


• | Global Scale and Presence: Our scale and on-the-ground presence across three continents - Asia, Europe and North America - give us a distinct and comprehensive perspective on the private equity and real estate markets. Our stable, dedicated, and experienced teams have deep knowledge of their respective markets across the globe. We believe this enhances our visibility across the global investment market and provides detailed local information that enhances our investment evaluation process. 

Our Family of Funds
The following chart presents the name (acronym), total capital commitments (in the case of our carry funds, structured credit funds, and the NGP Predecessor Funds), assets under management (in the case of structured products), gross assets (in the case of our BDCs) and vintage year of the active funds in each of our segments, as of December 31, 2018. We present total capital commitments (as opposed to assets under management) for our closed-end investment funds because we believe this metric provides the most useful information regarding the relative size and scale of such funds. In the case of our products which are open-ended and accordingly do not have permanent committed capital, we generally believe the most useful metric regarding relative size and scale is assets under management.

Organizational Structure
The simplified diagram below depicts our organizational structure. Ownership information in the diagram below is presented as of December 31, 2018. The diagram does not depict all of our subsidiaries, including intermediate holding companies through which certain of the subsidiaries depicted are held. As discussed in greater detail below, The Carlyle Group L.P. holds, through wholly owned subsidiaries, a number of Carlyle Holdings partnership units that is equal to the number of common units that The Carlyle Group L.P. has issued and benefits from the income of Carlyle Holdings to the extent of its equity interests in the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. While the holders of common units of The Carlyle Group L.P. are entitled to all of the economic rights in The Carlyle Group L.P., the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships, like the wholly owned subsidiaries of The Carlyle Group L.P., hold Carlyle Holdings partnership units that entitle them to economic rights in Carlyle Holdings to the extent of their equity interests in the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. Public investors do not directly hold equity interests in the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. 

(1) | The Carlyle Group L.P. common unitholders have only limited voting rights and have no right to remove our general partner or, except in limited circumstances, elect the directors of our general partner. TCG Carlyle Global Partners L.L.C., an entity wholly owned by our senior Carlyle professionals, holds a special voting unit in The Carlyle Group L.P. that entitles it, on those few matters that may be submitted for a vote of The Carlyle Group L.P. common unitholders, to participate in the vote on the same basis as the common unitholders and provides it with a number of votes that is equal to the aggregate number of vested and unvested partnership units in Carlyle Holdings held by the limited partners of Carlyle Holdings on the relevant record date.


(2) | Certain individuals engaged in our business own interests directly in selected subsidiaries, including, in certain instances, entities that receive management fees from funds that we advise. See “— Structure and Operation of Our Investment Funds — Incentive Arrangements/Fee Structure” in this Item 1 for additional information.

The Carlyle Group L.P. conducts all of its material business activities through Carlyle Holdings. Each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships was formed to hold our interests in different businesses. Carlyle Holdings I L.P. owns all of our U.S. fee-generating businesses and many of our non-U.S. fee-generating businesses, as well as our carried interests (and other investment interests) that derive income that we believe is not qualifying income for purposes of the U.S. federal income tax publicly-traded partnership rules and certain of our carried interests (and other investment interests) that do not relate to investments in stock of corporations or in debt, such as equity investments in entities that are pass-through for U.S. federal 
14

income tax purposes. Carlyle Holdings II L.P. holds a variety of assets, including our carried interests in many of the investments by our carry funds in entities that are treated as domestic corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and in certain non-U.S. entities. Certain of our non-U.S. fee-generating businesses, as well as our non-U.S. carried interests (and other investment interests) that derive income that we believe is not qualifying income for purposes of the U.S. federal income tax publicly-traded partnership rules and certain of our non-U.S. carried interests (and other investment interests) that do not relate to investments in stock of corporations or in debt, such as equity investments in entities that are pass-through for U.S. federal income tax purposes are held by Carlyle Holdings III L.P.
The Carlyle Group L.P. has wholly owned subsidiaries that serve as the general partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships: Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. (a Delaware corporation that is a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes), Carlyle Holdings II GP L.L.C. (a Delaware limited liability company that is a disregarded entity and not an association taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P. (a Québec société en commandite that is a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) serve as the general partners of Carlyle Holdings I L.P., Carlyle Holdings II L.P. and Carlyle Holdings III L.P., respectively. Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. and Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P. serve as the general partners of Carlyle Holdings I L.P. and Carlyle Holdings III L.P., respectively, through wholly owned subsidiaries that are disregarded for federal income tax purposes. We refer to Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc., Carlyle Holdings II GP L.L.C. and Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P. collectively as the “Carlyle Holdings General Partners.”
Holding Partnership Structure
The Carlyle Group L.P. is treated as a partnership and not as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, although our partnership agreement does not restrict our ability to take actions that may result in our being treated as an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal (and applicable state) income tax purposes. An entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not a taxable entity and incurs no U.S. federal income tax liability. Instead, each partner is required to take into account its allocable share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction of the partnership in computing its U.S. federal income tax liability, whether or not cash distributions are made. Each holder of our common units is a limited partner of The Carlyle Group L.P., and accordingly, is generally required to pay U.S. federal income taxes with respect to the income and gain of The Carlyle Group L.P. that is allocated to such holder, even if The Carlyle Group L.P. does not make cash distributions. We believe that the Carlyle Holdings partnerships should also be treated as partnerships and not as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the holders of partnership units in Carlyle Holdings, including The Carlyle Group L.P.’s wholly owned subsidiaries, incur U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on their proportionate share of any net taxable income of Carlyle Holdings.
Each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships has an identical number of partnership units outstanding, and we use the terms “Carlyle Holdings partnership unit” or “partnership unit in/of Carlyle Holdings” to refer collectively to a partnership unit in each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. The Carlyle Group L.P. holds, through wholly owned subsidiaries, a number of Carlyle Holdings partnership units equal to the number of common units that The Carlyle Group L.P. has issued. The Carlyle Holdings partnership units that are held by The Carlyle Group L.P.’s wholly owned subsidiaries are economically identical to the Carlyle Holdings partnership units that are held by the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. Accordingly, the income of Carlyle Holdings benefits The Carlyle Group L.P. to the extent of its equity interest in Carlyle Holdings.
The Carlyle Group L.P. is managed and operated by our general partner, Carlyle Group Management L.L.C., to whom we refer as “our general partner,” which is in turn wholly owned by our senior Carlyle professionals. Our general partner does not have any business activities other than managing and operating us. We reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all costs incurred in managing and operating us, and our partnership agreement provides that our general partner determines the expenses that are allocable to us. Although there are no ceilings on the expenses for which we will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates, the expenses to which they may be entitled to reimbursement from us, such as director fees, historically have not been, and are not expected to be, material.
LP Relations
Our diverse and sophisticated investor base includes more than 1,950 active investors in our carry funds, excluding Investment Solutions, located in 90 countries. Included among our many longstanding fund investors are pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies and high net worth individuals in the United States, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and South America.
We strive to maintain a systematic fundraising approach to support growth and serve our investor needs. This approach to fundraising has been critical in raising over $33 billion in 2018. We continuously seek to strengthen and expand our relationships with them through frequent investor engagement and by cross-selling products across our diverse platform. We 
15

have a dedicated in-house LP relations group, which includes 26 geographically-focused professionals with extensive investor relations and fundraising experience. In addition, we have 13 product specialists with a focus on specific business segments and 11 professionals focused on high net worth distribution. Our LP relations group is supported by 50 support staff responsible for project management and fulfillment. Our LP relations professionals are in constant dialogue with our fund investors, which enables us to monitor investor preferences and tailor future fund offerings to meet investor demand. We strive to secure a first-mover advantage with key investors, often by establishing a local presence and providing a broad and diverse range of investment opportunities. 
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 92% of commitments to our active carry funds (by dollar amount) were from investors who are committed to more than one active carry fund and approximately 66% of commitments to our active carry funds (by dollar amount) were from investors who are committed to more than five active carry funds. We believe the loyalty of our carry fund investor base, as evidenced by our substantial number of multi-fund relationships, enhances our ability to raise new funds and successor funds in existing strategies.
Investor Services
We have a team of over 500 investor services professionals worldwide. The investor services group performs a range of functions to support our investment teams, LP relations group and the corporate infrastructure of Carlyle. Our investor services professionals provide an important control function, ensuring that transactions are structured pursuant to the partnership agreements, assisting in global regulatory compliance requirements and investor reporting to enable investors to easily monitor the performance of their investments. We have devoted substantial resources to creating comprehensive and timely investor reports, which are increasingly important to our investor base. The investor services group also works closely with each fund’s lifecycle, from fund formation and investments to portfolio monitoring and fund liquidation. We maintain an internal global legal and compliance team, which includes 31 professionals and a government relations group with a presence around the globe, which includes 15 professionals as of December 31, 2018. We intend to continue to build and invest in our legal, regulatory and compliance and tax functions to enable our investment teams to better serve our investors.
Structure and Operation of Our Investment Funds 
We conduct the sponsorship and management of our carry funds and other investment vehicles primarily through limited partnerships, which are organized by us, to accept commitments and/or funds for investment from institutional investors and high net worth individuals. Each investment fund that is a limited partnership, or “partnership” fund, has a general partner that is responsible for the management and operation of the fund’s affairs and makes all policy and investment decisions relating to the conduct of the investment fund’s business. Generally, the limited partners of such funds take no part in the conduct or control of the business of such funds, have no right or authority to act for or bind such funds and have no influence over the voting or disposition of the securities or other assets held by such funds, although such limited partners may vote on certain partnership matters including the removal of the general partner or early liquidation of the partnership by majority vote, as discussed below. Most of our funds also have an investor advisory committee, comprising representatives of certain limited partners, which may consider and/or waive conflicts of interest or otherwise consult with the general partner on certain partnership matters. In the case of certain separately managed accounts advised by us, the investor, rather than us, may control the asset or the investment decisions related thereto or certain investment vehicles or entities that hold or have custody of such assets. More often, however, we retain investment discretion with respect to separately managed accounts we advise. 
Each investment fund and in the case of our separately managed accounts, the client, engages an investment adviser. Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. (“CIM”) or one of its subsidiaries or affiliates serves as an investment adviser for most of our carry funds and is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). Carlyle Global Credit Investment Management L.L.C. ("CGCIM") is an affiliate of CIM and serves as investment adviser for most of our Global Credit carry funds and clients, as well as our BDCs and is registered under the Advisers Act. The business of Carlyle Aviation Partners includes investment funds organized to invest in certain aviation assets (including aircraft, engines and components), and the adviser and general partner of such funds are currently not registered under the Advisers Act or otherwise operated in reliance on another entity's registration under the Advisers Act. Our investment advisers are generally entitled to a management fee from each investment fund for which they serve as investment advisers. For a discussion of the management fees to which our investment advisers are entitled across our various types of investment funds, see “—Incentive Arrangements / Fee Structure” below.
Investment funds themselves typically do not register as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act” or the “Investment Company Act”), in reliance on Section 3(c)(7) or Section 7(d) thereof or, typically in the case of funds formed prior to 1997, Section 3(c)(1) thereof. Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act exempts from the 
16

1940 Act’s registration requirements investment funds privately placed in the United States whose securities are owned exclusively by persons who, at the time of acquisition of such securities, are “qualified purchasers” as defined under the 1940 Act and purchase their interests in a private placement. Section 3(c)(1) of the 1940 Act exempts from the 1940 Act’s registration requirements privately placed investment funds whose securities are beneficially owned by not more than 100 persons and purchase their interests in a private placement. In addition, under certain current interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), Section 7(d) of the 1940 Act exempts from registration any non-U.S. investment fund all of whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned either by non-U.S. residents or by U.S. residents that are qualified purchasers and purchase their interests in a private placement. Certain of our investment funds, however, rely on other exemptions from the 1940 Act or register as investment companies under the 1940 Act or elect to be regulated as BDCs under the 1940 Act.
The governing agreements of the vast majority of our investment funds provide that, subject to certain conditions, a majority in interest (based on capital commitments) of third-party investors in those funds have the right to remove the general partner of the fund for cause and/or to accelerate the liquidation date of the investment fund without cause. In addition, the governing agreements of many of our investment funds generally require investors in those funds to affirmatively vote to continue the commitment period in the event that certain “key persons” in our investment funds do not provide the specified time commitment to the fund or our firm, cease to control the general partner (or similar managing entity) or the investment adviser or cease to hold a specified percentage of the economic interests in the general partner.
With limited exceptions, our carry funds, BDCs, and NGP Predecessor Funds are closed-end funds. In a closed-end fund structure, once an investor makes an investment, the investor is generally not able to withdraw or redeem its interest, except in very limited circumstances. Furthermore, each limited partnership contains restrictions on an investor’s ability to transfer its interest in the fund. In the open-ended funds we advise, investors' interests are usually locked up for a period of time after which investors may generally redeem their interests on a quarterly basis, to the extent that sufficient cash is available.
With respect to our CPE, Real Assets and Global Credit carry funds, investors generally agree to fund their commitment over a period of time. For our carry funds, the commitment period generally runs until the earlier of (i) the sixth anniversary of either the effective date (the date we start charging management fees for the fund) or the initial closing date or the fifth anniversary of the final closing date of the fund; (ii) the date the general partner cancels such obligation due to changes in applicable laws, business conditions or when at least a significant portion (which may range between 75% and 90%) of the capital commitments to the fund have been invested, committed or reserved for investments; (iii) the date a supermajority in interest (based on capital commitments) of investors vote to terminate the commitment period; or (iv) the failure of certain key persons to devote a specified amount of time to such fund or Carlyle, to control the general partner or the investment adviser or to hold a specified percentage of the economic interests in the general partner, unless upon any of these events the investors vote to continue the commitment period. Following the termination of the commitment period, an investor generally will be released from any further obligation with respect to its undrawn capital commitment except to the extent necessary to pay partnership expenses and management fees, fund outstanding borrowings and guarantees, complete investments with respect to transactions committed to prior to the end of the commitment period and make follow-on investments in existing companies. Generally, an investor’s obligation to fund follow-on investments extends for a period of three years following the end of the commitment period, although certain funds do not have a time limit and there may be limitations on how much the fund is permitted to fund for such follow-on investments. In those funds where such limitations exist, they generally range from 15-20% of the fund's aggregate capital commitment.
For the latest generation of our closed-end real estate funds, the length of the commitment period varies from fund to fund, typically running for a period of between two and five years from the final closing date, provided that the general partner may unilaterally extend such expiration date for one year and may extend it for another year with the consent of a majority of the limited partners or the investment advisory committee for that fund. Investors in the latest generation of our closed-end real estate funds are also obligated to continue to make capital contributions with respect to follow-on investments and to repay indebtedness for a period of time after the original expiration date of the commitment period, as well as to fund partnership expenses and management fees during the life of the fund.
The term of each of the CPE, Real Assets and Global Credit carry funds generally will end 10 years from the initial closing date, or in some cases, from the final closing date, but such termination date may be earlier in certain limited circumstances (e.g., 6 years, in the case of certain Carlyle Aviation Partners funds) or later if extended by the general partner (in many instances with the consent of a majority in interest (based on capital commitments) of the investors or the investment advisory committee) for successive one-year periods, typically up to a maximum of two years. Certain of such investment funds may have a longer initial termination date (such funds, "longer-dated funds"), such as 15 years from the final closing date or may be open-ended.
17

With respect to our Investment Solutions vehicles and separately managed accounts, the commitment period generally runs for a period of one to five years after the initial closing date of the vehicle. Following the termination of the commitment period, an investor in one of our Investment Solutions vehicles or separately managed accounts generally will only be required to fund additional amounts for commitments entered into during the commitment period, partnership expenses (including management fees and indemnification obligations), outstanding borrowings and guarantees, and follow-on investments in existing companies. The term of each of the funds generally will end 8 to 12 years from the initial closing date. In some cases, the termination date may be later if extended by the general partner (in many instances with the consent of a majority in interest (based on capital commitments) of the investors or the investment advisory committee) for successive up to two-year periods, potentially up to a maximum of four years or until such time as is reasonably necessary for the general partner to be able to liquidate the fund's assets.
Incentive Arrangements / Fee Structure
Fund Management Fees. The Partnership provides management services to funds in which it holds a general partner interest or has a management agreement. For closed-end carry funds in the CPE, Real Assets and Global Credit segments, management fees generally range from 1.0% to 2.0% of commitments during the fund's commitment period based on limited partners' capital commitments to the funds. Following the expiration or termination of the commitment period, management fees generally are based on the lower of cost or fair value of invested capital and the rate charged may also be reduced to between 0.6% and 2.0%. For certain separately managed accounts, open-end funds and longer-dated carry funds, with expected terms greater than ten years, management fees generally range from 0.2% to 1.0% based on contributions for unrealized investments or the current value of the investment. The investment adviser will receive management fees during a specified period of time, which is generally ten years from the initial closing date, or, in some instances, from the final closing date, but such termination date may be earlier in certain limited circumstances or later if extended for successive one year periods, typically up to a maximum of two years. Depending on the contracted terms of the investment advisory or investment management and related agreements, these fees are generally called semi-annually in advance. For certain open-end and longer-dated carry funds, management fees are called quarterly over the life of the funds.
Within the Global Credit segment, for CLOs and other structured products, management fees generally range from 0.4% to 0.5% based on the total par amount of assets or the aggregate principal amount of the notes in the CLO and are due quarterly or semi-annually based on the terms. Management fees for the CLOs and other structured products are governed by indentures and collateral management agreements. The investment advisers will receive management fees for the CLOs until redemption of the securities issued by the CLOs, which is generally five to ten years after issuance. Management fees for the BDCs are due quarterly in arrears at annual rates that range from 1.25% of invested capital to 1.5% of gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents. 
The investment advisers of our Investment Solutions private equity and real estate carry fund vehicles generally receive an annual management fee that ranges from 0.25% to 1.0% of the vehicle’s capital commitments during the commitment fee period of the relevant fund or the weighted-average commitment period of the underlying funds. Following the expiration of the commitment fee period or weighted-average investment period of such funds, the management fees generally range from 0.25% to 1.0% on (i) the lower of cost or fair value of the capital invested, (ii) the net asset value for unrealized investments or (iii) the contributions for unrealized investments; however certain separately managed accounts earn management fees at all times on contributions for unrealized investments or on the initial commitment amount. The management fees we receive from our Investment Solutions carry fund vehicles typically are payable quarterly in advance. 
Our equity interest in NGP entitles us to an allocation of income equal to 55% of the management fee-related revenues of the NGP entities that serve as advisors to the NGP Energy Funds. 
The general partners or investment advisers to certain of our CPE, Real Assets and Global Credit carry funds from time to time receive customary transaction fees upon consummation of many of our funds’ acquisition transactions, receive monitoring fees from many of their portfolio companies following acquisition and may from time to time receive other fees in connection with their activities. The ongoing monitoring fees that they receive are generally calculated either as a fixed amount or as a percentage of a specified financial metric of a particular portfolio company. The transaction fees which they receive are generally calculated either as a fixed amount or as a percentage (that generally ranges up to 1%, but may exceed 1% in certain circumstances) of the total enterprise value or capitalization of the investment. The management fees charged to limited partner investors in our carry funds are generally reduced by 80% to 100% of such transaction fees and certain other fees that are received by the general partners and their affiliates.
In addition, Carlyle Aviation Partners may receive servicing fees in connection with asset-backed financing transactions for certain Carlyle Aviation Partners funds, generally in the range of 2% of rents, incentive fees up to 4% of rents in 
18

the aggregate, and 3% of sales proceeds earned from such assets. To the extent the financing instruments are held by the funds, these fees are generally offset against management fees or partnership expenses of the funds.
Performance Allocations. The general partner of each of our carry funds also receives carried interest from the carry funds. Carried interest entitles the general partner to a special residual allocation of profit on third-party capital. In the case of our closed-end carry funds in the CPE, Real Assets and Global Credit segments, carried interest is generally calculated on a “realized gain” basis, and each general partner is generally entitled to a carried interest equal to 20% allocation (or 10% to 20% on certain open-end and longer-dated carry funds, certain credit funds and external co-investment vehicles, or approximately 10% in the case of most of the recent Investment Solutions carry funds, and approximately 2% to 10% in the case of most of our more mature Investment Solutions carry funds) of the net realized profit (generally taking into account unrealized losses) generated by third-party capital invested in such fund. Net realized profit or loss is not netted between or among funds. Our senior Carlyle professionals and other personnel who work in these operations also own interests in the general partners of our carry funds and we generally allocate 45% of any carried interest that we earn to these individuals in order to better align their interests with our own and with those of the investors in the funds. Of the 55% of the carried interest that we retain, we may utilize a portion for a plan for certain of our employees who do not receive direct allocations of carried interest to further align their interests with those of our own and the investors in our investment funds. For most carry funds, the carried interest is subject to an annual preferred return of 7% to 9% (or 4% to 7% for certain longer-dated carry funds) and return of certain fund costs (generally subject to catch-up provisions as set forth in the fund limited partnership agreement) from its CPE, Real Assets and Global Credit carry funds. If, as a result of diminished performance of later investments in the life of a closed-end fund, the fund does not achieve investment returns that (in most cases) exceed the preferred return threshold or (in almost all cases) the general partner receives in excess of 20% (or 10% to 20% on certain longer-dated carry funds as well as some external co-investment vehicles, as well as certain vehicles and accounts managed by Carlyle Aviation Partners or approximately 2% to 10% in the case of most of our Investment Solutions carry fund vehicles) of the net profits on third-party capital over the life of the fund, we will be obligated to repay the amount by which the carried interest that was previously distributed to us exceeds amounts to which we are ultimately entitled. This obligation, which is known as a “giveback” obligation, operates with respect to a given carry fund’s own net investment performance only and is typically capped at the after-tax amount of carried interest received by the general partner. Each recipient of carried interest distributions is individually responsible for his or her proportionate share of any "giveback" obligation; however, we may guarantee the full amount of such “giveback” obligation in respect of amounts received by Carlyle and certain other amounts. With respect to the portion of any carried interest allocated to the firm, we expect to fund any "giveback" obligation from available cash. Our ability to generate carried interest is an important element of our business and carried interest has historically accounted for a significant portion of our income.
The receipt of carried interest in respect of investments of our carry funds is dictated by the terms of the partnership agreements that govern such funds, which generally allow for carried interest distributions in respect of an investment upon a realization event after satisfaction of obligations relating to the return of capital from all realized investments, any realized losses, allocable fees and expenses and the applicable annual preferred return. Carried interest is ultimately realized and distributed when: (i) an underlying investment is profitably disposed of, (ii) certain costs borne by the limited partner investors have been reimbursed, (iii) the investment fund’s cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return and (iv) we have decided to collect carry rather than return additional capital to limited partner investors. Distributions to eligible senior Carlyle professionals in respect of such carried interest are generally made shortly thereafter. Our decision to realize carry considers such factors as the level of embedded valuation gains, the portion of the fund invested, the portion of the fund returned to limited partner investors and the length of time the fund has been in carry, as well as other qualitative measures. Although Carlyle has seldom been obligated to pay a giveback obligation, such obligation, if any, in respect of previously realized carried interest, is generally determined and due upon the winding up or liquidation of a carry fund pursuant to the terms of the fund’s partnership agreement, although in certain cases the giveback is calculated at prior intervals.
Under our arrangements with the historical owners of Carlyle Aviation Partners, we are entitled to 100% of the management fee-related revenues and advisory fee-related revenues of Carlyle Aviation Partners that serve as advisors or service providers of the Carlyle Aviation Partners funds and portfolios of investments. In addition, we will receive 55% of the carried interest from funds managed or advised by Carlyle Aviation Partners, with the remaining 45% being allocated to the prior owners of Carlyle Aviation Partners and certain employees.
With respect to our arrangements with NGP, we have acquired future interests in the general partners of certain future funds advised by NGP that will entitle us to an allocation of income equal to 47.5% of the carried interest received by such fund general partners. In addition, we also exercised our option to purchase interests in the general partner of the NGP X fund, which entitles us to an allocation of income equal to 40% of the carried interest received by NGP X's general partner. 
19

Under our arrangements with the historical owners and management team of AlpInvest, we generally do not retain any carried interest in respect of the historical investments and commitments to our fund of funds vehicles that existed as of July 1, 2011 (including any options to increase any such commitments exercised after such date). We are entitled to 15%, or in some cases 40%, of the carried interest in respect of commitments from the historical owners of AlpInvest for the period between 2011 and 2020 and 40% of the carried interest in respect of all other commitments (including all future commitments from third parties). 
Under our arrangements with the historical owners and management team of Metropolitan, the management team and employees are allocated all carried interest in respect of the historical investments and commitments to the fund vehicles that have had a final closing on or prior to July 31, 2013, and 45% of the carried interest in respect of all other commitments. 
As noted above, in connection with raising new funds or securing additional investments in existing funds, we negotiate terms for such funds and investments with existing and potential investors. The outcome of such negotiations could result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us than for prior funds we have advised or funds advised by our competitors. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business Operations — Our investors in future funds may negotiate to pay us lower management fees and the economic terms of our future funds may be less favorable to us than those of our existing funds, which could adversely affect our revenues.”
Capital Invested in and Alongside Our Investment Funds
To further align our interests with those of investors in our investment funds, we have invested our own capital and that of our senior Carlyle professionals in and alongside the investment funds we sponsor and advise. Carlyle generally expects to commit to fund approximately 0.75% to 1% of the capital commitments to our future CPE, Real Assets and Global Credit carry funds. We also intend to make investments in our Investment Solutions carry funds, our open-end funds and our CLO vehicles. In addition, certain qualified Carlyle professionals and other qualified individuals (including certain individuals who may not be employees of the firm but who have pre-existing business relationships with Carlyle or industry expertise in the sector in which a particular investment fund may be investing) are permitted, subject to certain restrictions, to invest alongside the investment funds we sponsor and advise. Fees assessed or profit allocations on such investments by such persons may be eliminated or substantially reduced.
Minimum general partner capital commitments to our investment funds are determined separately with respect to each investment fund. We may, from time to time, exercise our right to purchase additional interests in our investment funds that become available in the ordinary course of their operations. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more information regarding our minimum general partner capital commitments to our funds. Our general partner capital commitments are funded with cash and not with carried interest or through a management fee waiver program.
Carlyle and its eligible employees and officers generally have the right to co-invest with most of the CPE and Real Asset and Global Credit carry funds on a deal-by-deal basis.
One Carlyle Culture
Our culture is built on promoting innovation, good citizenship and service to our investors. Carlyle uses its One Carlyle global network, deep industry knowledge, Operating Executive consultants and portfolio intelligence to create and execute a customized value creation plan for each of our CPE and Real Assets investments. To further this end, Carlyle has created a Global Investment Resources team that helps to translate our One Carlyle culture into services and capabilities supporting our investment process and portfolio companies. This team coordinates with our investment professionals and advisors, including our operating executive and other consultants, to create value during the investment lifecycle. We have also developed a leveraged purchasing effort to provide portfolio companies with effective sourcing programs with better pricing and service levels to help create operating value. This program seeks to drive down costs on common indirect spend categories and disseminate best practices on managing functional spend in the areas of HR/employee benefits, corporate real estate, information technology and treasury/risk. Our approach ensures that Carlyle’s global network, deep industry knowledge and operational expertise are used to support and enhance our investments.
Corporate Citizenship
We are committed to the principle that building a better business means investing responsibly and engaging in communities where we work and invest. Responsible investing means we consider the environmental, social and governance 
20

(ESG) implications of our investments, and have developed a framework for understanding, monitoring and managing those issues. In September 2008, Carlyle developed a set of responsible investment guidelines that consider the environmental, social and governance implications of certain investments we make. These guidelines were integral to shaping the corporate social responsibility guidelines later adopted by the members of the American Investment Council. We use the principles in these guidelines to inform our investment decision-making process for controlling, corporate investments. 
Over the years, we have sought to continuously strengthen governance and transparency, ensuring that the interests of our investors, portfolio companies and investment professionals are aligned with our ESG goals. Good governance processes enable us to monitor current and emerging risks and provide investors with the transparency they require. We maintain strong internal corporate governance processes and fiduciary functions and are subject to regulatory supervision. Carlyle professionals receive regular and targeted training on many issues related to corporate governance and compliance, such as anti-corruption, conflicts of interest, economic sanctions and anti-money laundering. All employees annually certify to their understanding of and compliance with key global Carlyle policies and procedures.
ESG considerations play a growing role in our investment processes and the operations of our portfolio companies. As part of Carlyle's investment process for our Corporate Private Equity funds, we evaluate ESG risks and seek opportunities to create value through sustainability initiatives. During our ownership period, we support our management teams' efforts to develop strategic ESG programs and provide access to prescreened vendors, sustainability resources and individualized assistance from our Chief Sustainability Officer. Carlyle educates portfolio companies in which we have a controlling interest on the guidelines for responsible investment and encourage them to review the guidelines at the board level on an annual basis. We see sustainability efforts adding value primarily in four areas: customer satisfaction, brand equity, operational efficiency and cost savings and workforce. 
At Carlyle we believe that diverse teams and experiences bring tremendous value to our firm. We are committed to growing and cultivating an environment that fosters diversity in gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, religion and age, as well as cultural backgrounds and ideas.
In 2013, Carlyle established our Diversity & Inclusion Council, which we believe is the first of its kind in our industry. We currently have seven Employee Resource Groups (ERG) to foster and cultivate a diverse and inclusive workforce. We also have a mentoring program that provides support for employees across the globe. Carlyle earned a 100% rating on the 2018 Corporate Equality Index (CEI), a national benchmarking survey and report on corporate policies and practices related to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) workplace equality, administered by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. In 2018, Carlyle hired a Chief Inclusion and Diversity Officer.
We encourage our employees to get involved where they live, work and invest through our volunteer and wealth sharing programs. We work to continually improve environmental stewardship within our firm, particularly in the areas of energy and materials use. In 2018, Carlyle achieved carbon neutral operations, based on our analysis as of September 30, 2018.
We are a member of the British Venture Capital Association and seek to ensure that our U.K.-based portfolio companies are compliant, on a voluntary basis, with the Private Equity Reporting Group Guidelines for Disclosure and Transparency when such companies become subject to these guidelines. Carlyle is a member of Invest Europe and an active participant in its work on ESG-related industry issues. Further, we are also a member of the Bundesverband Deutscher Kapitalbeteiligungsgesellschaften (BVK), the German private equity and venture capital trade association. We believe that we are compliant with the BVK Guidelines for Disclosure and Transparency and seek to ensure that our German portfolio companies comply with these guidelines when they are required to do so. 
AlpInvest is a signatory of the Principles for Responsible Investment and has adopted the UN Global Compact as a corporate social responsibility (CSR) framework to evaluate fund managers and portfolio companies. AlpInvest has fully integrated CSR into its investment process and actively engages with fund managers and other stakeholders in the private equity markets to promote sustainability and improved corporate governance as an investment consideration. 
Since Carlyle was established, we have recognized the value and benefits of maintaining a business model grounded in investment fundamentals, strong governance and transparency. We maintain strong internal corporate governance processes and fiduciary functions and are subject to regulatory supervision. Carlyle professionals receive regular and targeted training on many issues related to corporate governance and compliance, such as anti-corruption, conflicts of interest, economic sanctions and anti-money laundering. All employees annually certify to their understanding of and compliance with key global Carlyle policies and procedures.

Global Information Technology and Solutions
Global Information Technology and Solutions, which we refer to as GTS, is essential for Carlyle to conduct investment activities, manage internal administration activities and connect a global enterprise. As part of our GTS strategy and governance processes, we develop and routinely refine our technology architecture to leverage solutions that will best serve the needs of our investors. Our systems, data, network and infrastructure are continuously monitored and administered by formal controls and risk management processes that also help protect the data and privacy of our employees and investors. Our business continuity plans are designed to allow all critical business functions to continue in an orderly manner in the event of an emergency. GTS works closely with our various segments to test Carlyle's business continuity plans via table top exercises and disaster recovery exercises. GTS requires firm-wide information security awareness training on a quarterly basis to sensitize employees about the cyber risks to the firm with a goal of educating the firm on how to safeguard Carlyle's information assets. This annual testing is intended to help mitigate risk to the firm if an actual emergency were to occur. Carlyle's Information Security Steering Committee, chaired by the Chief Information Security Officer, monitors threats and prioritizes the initiatives of Carlyle's information security programs.
Competition
As a global investment firm, we compete with a broad array of regional and global investment firms, as well as global banking institutions and other types of financial institutions and markets, for both investors and investment opportunities. Generally, our competition varies across business lines, geographies, distribution channels and financial markets. We believe that our competition for investors is based primarily on investment performance, business relationships, the quality of services provided to investors, reputation and brand recognition, pricing and the relative attractiveness of the particular opportunity in which a particular fund intends to invest. To stay competitive, we believe it is also important to be able to offer fund investors a customized suite of investment products which enable them to tailor their investments across alternatives in private equity, real estate and credit. We believe that competition for investment opportunities varies across business lines, but is generally based on industry expertise and potential for value-add, pricing, terms and the structure of a proposed investment and certainty of execution.
We generally compete with sponsors of public and private investment funds across all of our segments. Within our CPE segment, we also compete with BDCs, sovereign wealth funds and operating companies acting as strategic acquirers. In our Global Credit segment, we compete with private credit strategies, BDCs, distressed debt funds, mezzanine funds and other CLO issuers. In our Real Assets segment, we compete with real estate development companies and other infrastructure investment business. In our Investment Solutions segment, we generally compete with other fund of funds managers and/or with advisers that are turning their business models towards discretionary investment advisory services. In the United States, the new government administration may propose changes to financial regulation that could increase competition from banks and non-bank institutions in certain of our business segments.
In addition to these traditional competitors within the global investment industry, we have increasingly faced competition from local and regional firms, financial institutions, sovereign wealth funds, family offices and agencies and instrumentalities of governments in the various countries in which we invest. This trend has been especially apparent in emerging markets, where local firms tend to have more established relationships with the companies in which we are attempting to invest. In addition, large institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds have begun to develop their own in-house investment capabilities and may compete against us for investment opportunities. Furthermore, in some cases, large institutional investors have reduced allocations to “fund of funds” vehicles and turned instead to private equity advisory firms that assist with direct investments. Greater reliance on advisory firms or in-house investment management may reduce fund of funds’ appeal to large institutional investors. As we continue to target high net worth investors, we also face competition from mutual funds and investment firms that have competing products. 
Some of the entities that we compete with as a global investment firm are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do. Several of our competitors also have recently raised or are expected to raise, significant amounts of capital and many of them have investment objectives similar to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities and investor capital. Some of these competitors may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us when sourcing investment opportunities. In addition, some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider range of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments. Strategic buyers may also be able to achieve synergistic cost savings or revenue enhancements with respect to a targeted portfolio company, which we may not be able to achieve through our own portfolio, and this may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for such investments.
22

Employees
We believe that one of the strengths and principal reasons for our success is the quality and dedication of our people. As of December 31, 2018, we employed more than 1,650 individuals, including 637 investment professionals, located in 31 offices across six continents.
Operating Executives
Supplementing Carlyle’s investment expertise, we have retained a group of senior business executives to help Carlyle invest wisely and create value across a range of industries. These operating executives are former CEOs and other high-level executives of some of the world’s most successful corporations and currently sit on the boards of directors of a diverse mix of companies. Operating executives are independent consultants and are not Carlyle employees. Operating executives are engaged by Carlyle primarily to assist with deal sourcing, due diligence and market intelligence. Carlyle typically retains these operating executives and bears the cost of such retainer fees. Operating executives may also be engaged by, and compensated by, our portfolio companies as directors or to otherwise advise portfolio company management.
Regulatory and Compliance Matters
United States
Our businesses, as well as the financial services industry generally, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere. The SEC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) and other regulators around the globe have in recent years significantly increased their regulatory activities with respect to global investment firms.
Certain of our subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers with the SEC. Registered investment advisers are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Advisers Act. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to advisory clients, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation agreements, conflicts of interest, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between an adviser and advisory clients and general anti-fraud prohibitions. In addition, our registered investment advisers are subject to routine periodic and other examinations by the staff of the SEC. In accordance with our efforts to enhance our compliance program and in response to recommendations received from the SEC in the course of routine examinations, certain additional policies and procedures have been put into place, but no material changes to our registered investment advisers’ operations have been made as a result of such examinations. Our registered investment advisers also have not been subject to any regulatory or disciplinary actions by the SEC. Finally, certain of our investment advisers are subject to limited SEC disclosure requirements as “exempt reporting advisers.”
TCG Securities, L.L.C. (“TCG Securities”), the affiliate entity through which we conduct U.S.-based marketing and fundraising activities and house our anti-money laundering compliance function, is registered as a limited purpose broker-dealer with the SEC, is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and is also registered as a broker-dealer in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Additionally, TCG Securities operates under an international broker-dealer exemption in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. TCG Securities acts as a placement agent, on a best efforts basis, for interests in private funds. 
In 2018 we obtained FINRA approval for TCG Capital Markets L.L.C. ("TCG Capital Markets"), an affiliate broker-dealer entity that operates as part of the Carlyle Capital Solutions platform ("CCS") within Global Credit, and engages in the syndication and placement of securities of corporate issuers in private transactions, among other related activities, including U.S.-based marketing and fundraising for Global Credit. In addition, TCG Capital Markets is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and in 48 states and the District of Columbia. The CCS platform also includes TCG Senior Funding, L.L.C., which has been established to originate and syndicate loans.
Additionally, FINRA, a self-regulatory organization that is subject to SEC oversight, maintains regulatory authority over all securities firms doing business with the public in the United States (including our broker-dealers), adopts and enforces rules governing the activities of its member firms and conducts cycle examinations and targeted sweep inquiries on issues of immediate concern, among other roles and responsibilities. Our broker-dealers are subject to routine periodic and other examinations by the staff of FINRA. No material changes to our broker-dealers' operations have been made as a result of such examinations.
Broker-dealers are subject to rules relating to transactions on a particular exchange and/or market, and rules relating to the internal operations of the firms and their dealings with customers including, but not limited to the form or organization of 
23

the firm, qualifications of associated persons, officers and directors, net capital and customer protection rules, books and records and financial statements and reporting. In particular, as a result of its registered status, each of TCG Securities and TCG Capital Markets are subject to the SEC’s uniform net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which specifies both the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain relative to the scope of its business activities and net capital liquidity parameters. The SEC and FINRA require compliance with key financial responsibility rules, including maintenance of adequate funds to meet expenses and contractual obligations, as well as early warning rules that compel notice to the regulators via accelerated financial reporting anytime a firm’s capital falls below the minimum required level. The uniform net capital rule limits the amount of qualifying subordinated debt that is treated as equity to a specific percentage under the debt-to-equity ratio test, and further limits the withdrawal of equity capital, which is subject to specific notice provisions. Finally, compliance with net capital rules may also limit a firm’s ability to expand its operations, particularly to those activities that require the use of capital. Violation of the net capital rule may result in censures, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, revocation of licenses or registrations, the suspension or expulsion from the securities industry of the broker-dealer or its officers or employees or other similar consequences by regulatory bodies. To date, neither TCG Securities nor TCG Capital Markets has had any capital adequacy issues and each entity is currently capitalized in excess of the minimum maintenance amount required by regulators.
Carlyle Global Credit Investment Management L.L.C. ("CGCIM"), one of our subsidiaries, serves as investment adviser to certain closed-end investment companies that have elected, or intend to elect, to be regulated as BDCs under the Investment Company Act (as well as to certain private fund and other clients). Accordingly, these BDCs are, or are expected to be, subject to all relevant provisions under the Investment Company Act as registered investment companies. In addition, CGCIM serves as a sub-adviser to OFI Carlyle Private Credit Fund, which is regulated as a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act and to which OC Private Capital, LLC, a Carlyle joint venture with OppenheimerFunds, Inc., serves as the investment adviser.
In 2011, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act amended the Commodity Exchange Act to expand the CFTC’s regulatory jurisdiction with respect to certain derivative instruments, including swaps. In 2012, the CFTC rescinded an exemption from CFTC registration traditionally relied upon by private fund managers, narrowed an exception related to registered investment companies and amended related rules and guidance. As a result of these changes, managers of certain pooled investment vehicles with exposure in commodity interests now may be required to register with the CFTC as commodity pool operators (“CPOs”) and/or commodity trading advisors (“CTAs”) and become members of the National Futures Association (the “NFA”). As such, certain of our or our subsidiaries’ risk management or other commodities interest-related activities may be subject to CFTC oversight. Consequently, certain CFTC rules expose global investment firms, such as us, to increased registration and reporting requirements in connection with transactions in futures, swaps and other derivatives regulated by the CFTC. These regulations have required us to reassess certain business practices related to our pooled vehicles, consider registration of certain entities with the CFTC or file for additional exemptions from such registration requirements. In addition, as a result of their commodities interest-related activities, certain of our entities also may be subject to a wide range of other regulatory requirements, such as:

• | potential compliance with certain commodities interest position limits or position accountability rules;


• | administrative requirements, including recordkeeping, confirmation of transactions and reconciliation of trade data; and


• | mandatory central clearing and collateral requirements.

United Kingdom and the European Union
CECP Advisors LLP (“CECP”), one of our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”). CECP operates in accordance with the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”), which is the United Kingdom’s implementing legislation for the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”). CECP has permission to engage in a number of corporate finance activities regulated under the FSMA, including advising on, and arranging deals in relation to certain types of, investments. CECP is only permitted to carry out these activities in relation to eligible counterparties and professional clients. CECP has registered a branch office in Ireland in connection with Carlyle’s investment activities in that country. CELF Advisors LLP (“CELF”), another one of our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, is also authorized and regulated by the FCA under the FSMA and has permission to engage in a number of activities regulated under the FSMA, including making arrangements with a view to transactions in investments, advising on, managing and arranging deals in relation to certain types of investments, dealing in investments as agent and arranging safeguarding and administration of assets. CELF is only permitted to carry out these activities in relation to eligible counterparties and professional clients. The FSMA and related rules govern most aspects of investment businesses, including sales, research and trading practices, provision of investment advice, corporate finance, use and safekeeping of client funds and 
24

securities, record keeping, margin practices and procedures, approval standards for individuals, anti-money laundering, periodic reporting and settlement procedures.
The FSMA says that any firm or individual which carries out a regulated activity in the United Kingdom must be authorized or regulated by the FCA, unless they are exempt. The FCA is responsible for monitoring regulated entities’ compliance with the FSMA. Violations of these requirements may result in censures, fines, imposition of additional requirements, injunctions, restitution orders, revocation or modification of permissions or registrations, the suspension or expulsion from certain “controlled functions” within the financial services industry of officers or employees performing such functions or other similar consequences.
Similar to the United States, jurisdictions outside the United States in which we operate, in particular Europe, have become subject to extensive further regulation. Governmental regulators and other authorities in Europe have proposed or implemented a number of initiatives and additional rules and regulations that could adversely affect our business. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to compliance requirements in connection with the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (the “AIFMD”), which generally became effective in countries across the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) in 2014. The AIFMD imposes significant regulatory requirements on alternative investment fund managers operating or marketing funds to investors within the EEA, as well as prescribing certain conditions with regard to regulatory standards, cooperation and transparency that must be satisfied for non-EEA fund managers to market or manage alternative investment funds into EEA jurisdictions. Authorization under the AIFMD is currently available only to EEA fund managers. One of Carlyle’s subsidiaries, AlpInvest, obtained such authorization in 2015. As such, AlpInvest is licensed as an alternative investment fund manager under the AIFMD by the Authority for Financial Markets in the Netherlands (the “AFM”). AlpInvest is also licensed by the AFM to provide investment management services under the MiFID. In early 2018 one of our subsidiaries, CIM Europe S.a.r.l. ("CIM Europe"), was authorized as an alternative investment fund manager under the AIFMD in Luxembourg to offer certain funds in Europe, however Carlyle’s Global Credit and real estate fund of funds are currently offered in the EEA in accordance with the national private placement regimes of the various EEA jurisdictions. Compliance with applicable AIFMD requirements may restrict Carlyle’s fund marketing strategy and will place additional compliance obligations in the form of remuneration policies, capital requirements, reporting requirements, leverage oversight and liquidity management. 
Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various aspects of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”). Among other things, EMIR imposes a set of requirements on European Union derivatives activities, including risk mitigation, risk management, regulatory reporting and margin and clearing requirements. Given the global scale of the derivatives activity of various Carlyle entities, the various regulatory regimes to which Carlyle is subject could result in duplication of administration and increased transaction costs related to such derivatives activities.
As outlined above, certain of our European subsidiaries must comply with the pan-European regime established by MiFID, which regulates the provision and conduct of investment services and activities throughout the EEA. MiFID sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms, regulated markets and certain other entities such as credit institutions to the extent they perform investment services or activities. It also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for transactions within scope. MiFID has been substantially amended by Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation 600/2014/EU (collectively referred to as “MiFID II”) that has been effective since January 3, 2018. MiFID II is designed to amend the functioning of financial markets in light of the financial crisis and to strengthen investor protection. MiFID II has extended the MiFID requirements in a number of areas including market structure requirements, new and extended requirements in relation to transparency and transaction reporting, revised rules on research and inducements and product governance requirements. MiFID II has therefore imposed further compliance requirements on CECP, CELF and AlpInvest.
As of May 2018, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) strengthened and unified data protection rules for individuals within the EU. GDPR also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU. The primary objectives of GDPR are to give citizens control of their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international businesses by unifying data protection regulation within the EU. As with any other organization that holds personal data of EU data subjects, we have to comply with the GDPR because, among other things, we process European individuals' personal data via our global technology systems and in connection with our business activities. The failure to comply timely and properly with the GDPR rules and to maintain ongoing compliance with such rules may subject us to enforcement proceedings and significant fines and costs.
The impact of the United Kingdom's anticipated withdrawal from the EU ("Brexit") on our business operations in the United Kingdom and the EU is unknown, and will vary depending on the final terms of the impending withdrawal agreement or in a "no deal" scenario. Ongoing changes in the EU's regulatory framework applicable to our operations, including the impact

of Brexit as well as any other changes in the composition of the EU's member states, are expected to add complexity to our global operations, particularly as it relates to regulatory licensing for certain activities (e.g. investment advisory services, fundraising, etc.) See "Item 1A, Risk Factors" below for further detail on Brexit.
Other Jurisdictions
Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to registration and compliance with laws and regulations of non-U.S. governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to, among other things, investment advisory services and the marketing of investment products, and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or damage our reputation. Certain of our private funds are also required to comply with the trading and disclosure rules and regulations of non-U.S. securities regulators.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the “OECD”) has developed Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) rules for the automatic exchange of FATCA-like financial account information amongst OECD member states. Like FATCA, CRS imposes certain due diligence, documentation and reporting requirements on various Carlyle entities. While CRS does not contain a potential withholding requirement, non-compliance could subject Carlyle to certain reputational harm.

In November 2018, TC Group Cayman Investment Holdings, L.P. acquired a 19.9% stake in Fortitude Re, a Bermuda company registered as a Class 4 and Class E insurer.  Fortitude Re is subject to regulation and supervision by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the “BMA”) and compliance with all applicable Bermuda law and Bermuda insurance statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the Insurance Act of 1978 (Bermuda) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the “Bermuda Insurance Act”).  In addition, as a result of the acquisition, TC Group Cayman Investment Holdings, L.P. is subject to certain insurance laws and regulations in Bermuda as a “controller” of Fortitude Re under the Bermuda Insurance Act.  These laws and regulations include certain notice requirements for any person that has become, or as a result of a disposition ceased to be, a shareholder controller of a registered insurer, and failure to comply with such requirements is an offense punishable by law.  
In addition, we and/or our affiliates and subsidiaries may become subject to additional regulatory demands in the future to the extent we expand our investment advisory business in existing and new jurisdictions. There are also a number of pending or recently enacted legislative and regulatory initiatives in the United States and around the world that could significantly impact our business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Company- Extensive regulation in the United States and abroad affects our activities, increases the cost of doing business and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties,” “-Financial regulatory changes in the United States could adversely affect our business and the possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens and expenses on our business” and “-Regulatory initiatives in jurisdictions outside the United States could adversely affect our business.”
Our businesses have operated for many years within a framework that requires our being able to monitor and comply with a broad range of legal and regulatory developments that affect our activities and we take our obligation to comply with all such laws, regulations and internal policies seriously. Our reputation depends on the integrity and business judgment of our employees and we strive to maintain a culture of compliance throughout the firm. We have developed, and adhere to, compliance policies and procedures such as codes of conduct, compliance systems, education and communication of compliance matters. These policies focus on matters such as insider trading, anti-corruption, document retention, conflicts of interest and other matters. Our legal and compliance team monitors our compliance with all of the legal and regulatory requirements to which we are subject and manages our compliance policies and procedures. Our legal and compliance team also monitors the information barriers that we maintain to restrict the flow of confidential information, including material, nonpublic information, across our business. Our enterprise risk management function analyzes our operations and investment strategies to identify key risks facing the firm and works closely with the legal and compliance team to address them. The firm also has an independent and objective internal audit department that employs a risk-based audit approach that focuses on Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, enterprise risk management functions and other areas of perceived risk and aims to give management and the Board of Directors of our general partner reasonable assurance that our risks are well managed and controls are appropriate and effective.
