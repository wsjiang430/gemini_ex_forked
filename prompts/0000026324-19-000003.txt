Item 1. Business.
BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
Curtiss-Wright Corporation and its subsidiaries (we, the Corporation, or the Company) is a global, diversified manufacturing and service company that designs, manufactures, and overhauls precision components and provides highly engineered products and services to the aerospace, defense, general industrial, and power generation markets. We were formed in 1929 by the merger of companies founded by the Wright brothers and Glenn Curtiss, who were aviation pioneers. We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and headquartered in Davidson, North Carolina. We list our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and trade under the symbol CW.
We expect that the diversification and breadth of our portfolio should mitigate the impact of business cycle volatility and allow us to drive growth in new products and markets. We seek to leverage and build upon our critical mass to expand our global manufacturing capabilities, sales channels, and customer relationships. We strive for consistent organic sales growth, operating margin expansion, and free cash flow generation, while maintaining a disciplined capital deployment strategy in order to drive long-term shareholder value.
We are well positioned on high-performance platforms and critical applications that require our technical sophistication and benefit from decades of engineering expertise. Our technologies are relied upon to improve safety, operating efficiency, and reliability, while meeting demanding performance requirements. Our ability to provide these advanced technologies on a cost-effective basis is fundamental to our strategy to drive increased value to our customers. We compete globally, primarily based on technology and pricing. 
Business Segments
We manage and evaluate our operations based on the products and services we offer and the different markets we serve. Based on this approach, we operate through three segments: Commercial/Industrial, Defense, and Power.
Our principal domestic manufacturing facilities are located in Arizona, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and internationally in Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. 
Commercial / Industrial 
Sales in the Commercial/Industrial segment are primarily to the general industrial and commercial aerospace markets and, to a lesser extent, the defense and power generation markets. The businesses in this segment provide a diversified offering of highly engineered products and services including: industrial vehicle products such as electronic throttle control devices, joysticks and transmission shifters; sensors, controls and electro-mechanical actuation components and utility systems used on commercial aircraft; valves to both the industrial and naval defense markets; and surface technology services such as shot peening, laser peening, coatings, and advanced analytical testing. The industrial businesses within our Commercial/Industrial segment are impacted primarily by general economic conditions which may include consumer consumption or commercial construction rates, as the nature of their products and services primarily support global industrial, oil and gas, commercial vehicles, medical, and transportation industries. The commercial aerospace business, in particular, is impacted by OEM production rates of new aircraft, while the defense business is impacted by government funding and spending on shipbuilding programs, primarily driven by the U.S. Government. As commercial industrial businesses, production and service processes rest primarily within material modification, machining, assembly, and testing and inspection at commercial grade specifications. The businesses distribute products through commercial sales and marketing channels.
Defense
Sales in the Defense segment are primarily to the defense markets and, to a lesser extent, to the commercial aerospace market. The businesses in this segment provide a diversified offering of products including: Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) embedded computing board-level modules, data acquisition and flight test instrumentation equipment, integrated subsystems, instrumentation and control systems, turret aiming and stabilization products, and weapons handling systems. The businesses within our Defense segment are impacted primarily by government funding and spending, driven primarily by the U.S. Government. Our products typically support government entities in the aerospace defense, ground defense, and naval defense industries. As a result, we have varying degrees of content on most fighter jets, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), helicopters, ground vehicle platforms, and naval vessels. Additionally, we provide avionics and electronics, flight test equipment, and aircraft data management solutions to the commercial aerospace market. Our defense businesses supporting government contractors typically utilize more advanced and ruggedized production and service processes compared to our commercial 
5

businesses and have more stringent specifications and performance requirements. The businesses in this segment typically market and distribute products through regulated government contracting channels.
Power 
Sales in the Power segment are primarily to the commercial nuclear power generation and naval defense markets. For the commercial markets, we provide a diversified offering of products for commercial nuclear power plants and nuclear equipment manufacturers, including hardware, pumps, valves, fastening systems, specialized containment doors, airlock hatches, and spent fuel management products. We also provide Reactor Coolant Pumps (RCPs) and control rod drive mechanisms for commercial nuclear power plants, most notably to support the Westinghouse AP1000 reactor design. The businesses are dependent upon the need for ongoing maintenance, repair and overhaul of existing operating power plants, typically to U.S. customers, as well as the construction of new power plants globally. The businesses distribute products through commercial sales and marketing channels and are impacted by pricing and demand for various forms of energy (e.g. coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear) and also subject to changes in regulation which may impact demand, consumption, and underlying supply. For the defense markets, our products principally support the naval defense market, where we specifically provide naval propulsion and auxiliary equipment, including main coolant pumps, power-dense compact motors, generators, steam turbines, valves and secondary propulsion systems, primarily to the U.S. Navy. We also provide ship repair and maintenance for the U.S. Navy’s Atlantic and Pacific fleets through three service centers. The defense businesses in this segment are impacted by government funding and spending on shipbuilding programs, primarily driven by the U.S. Government.
OTHER INFORMATION
Certain Financial Information
For information regarding sales by geographic region, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In 2018, 2017, and 2016, our foreign operations as a percentage of pre-tax earnings were 39%, 40%, and 42%, respectively.
Government Sales
Our sales to the U.S. Government and foreign government end use represented 40%, 39%, and 38% of total net sales during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
In accordance with normal U.S. Government business practices, contracts and orders are subject to partial or complete termination at any time at the option of the customer. In the event of a termination for convenience by the government, there generally are provisions for recovery of our allowable incurred costs and a proportionate share of the profit or fee on the work completed, consistent with regulations of the U.S. Government. Fixed-price redeterminable contracts usually provide that we absorb the majority of any cost overrun. In the event that there is a cost underrun, the customer recoups a portion of the underrun based upon a formula in which the customer’s portion increases as the underrun exceeds certain established levels.
Generally, long-term contracts with the U.S. Government require us to invest in and carry significant levels of inventory. However, where allowable, we utilize progress payments and other interim billing practices on nearly all of these contracts, thus reducing working capital requirements. It is our policy to seek customary progress payments on certain contracts. Where we obtain such payments under U.S. Government prime contracts or subcontracts, the U.S. Government generally has control of the materials and work in process allocable or chargeable to the respective contracts. (See Notes 1, 5, and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
Customers
We have hundreds of customers in the various industries we serve. No commercial customer accounted for more than 10% of our total sales during 2018, 2017, or 2016.
Approximately 34% of our total net sales for 2018, 33% for 2017, and 32% for 2016 were derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S. Government. Information on our sales to the U.S. Government, including both direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor, is as follows:

Patents
We own and license a number of United States and foreign patents and patent applications, which have been obtained or filed over a period of years. We also license intellectual property to and from third parties. Specifically, the U.S. Government receives licenses to our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the technology covered by such patents for government purposes. Additionally, trade secrets, unpatented research and development, and engineering, some of which have been acquired by the company through business acquisitions, make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of our business, we do not consider the success of our business or business segments to be materially dependent upon the timing of expiration or protection of any one or group of patents, patent applications, or patent license agreements under which we now operate.
Research and Development
Company-sponsored research and development costs are expensed when incurred. Total research and development expenses amounted to $65 million, $61 million, and $59 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
