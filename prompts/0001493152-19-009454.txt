Item 1. BUSINESS
INTRODUCTION TO OUR BUSINESS
 
InnSuites Hospitality Trust (the “Trust”) is headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona and is an unincorporated Ohio real estate investment trust formed on June 21, 1971. The Trust is not a real estate investment trust for federal taxation purposes, but is taxed as a C-corporation. The Trust, with its affiliates RRF Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Partnership”), and InnSuites® Hotels, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“InnSuites Hotels”), owns interests in two hotels, operates three hotels, provides management services for three hotels, and provides trademark license services for five hotels. At January 31, 2019, and currently, the Trust owns a 74.80% sole general partner interest in the Partnership, which controls a 51.01% interest in the InnSuites hotel located in Tucson, Arizona, and a direct 20.53% interest in the InnSuites hotel located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The Tucson and Albuquerque hotels are sometimes referred to as the “Hotels”. We anticipate selling one of the Hotels in the next twelve months, and the remaining Hotel within twelve months thereafter. 
 
InnSuites Hotels LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Trust, provides management services for the two Hotels and one hotel located in Tempe, Arizona (the “Tempe Hotel”) that is owned by affiliates of James F. Wirth, the Trust’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. InnSuites Hotels also provides trademark and licensing services to the Hotels, the Tempe Hotel and two unrelated hotel properties. The Trust has approximately 100 full-time employees and approximately 20 part-time employees.
 
The two Hotels have an aggregate of 267 hotel suites and operate as moderate and full-service hotels that apply a value studio and two-room suite operating philosophy formulated in 1980 by Mr. Wirth. The Trust owns and operates hotels as studio and two-room suite hotels that offer services such as free hot breakfast buffets and complimentary afternoon social hours plus amenities, such as microwave ovens, refrigerators, and free high-speed Internet access.
 
The Trust believes that it can sustain and increase cash flows by skillfully managing operations of the Hotels and managed hotel properties for both increased occupancy and rates. The Trust’s primary business objective is to maximize returns to its shareholders through increases in asset value and long-term total returns to shareholders, and eventual profitable sale of assets. The Trust seeks to achieve this objective through participation in increased revenues from the Hotels as a result of intensive management and marketing of the InnSuites© hotels, and by selling real estste in the strong real estate market. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Future Positioning” for a more detailed discussion of the Trust’s strategic objectives.
 
The Trust has a single class of Shares of Beneficial Interest, without par value, that are traded on the NYSE AMERICAN under the symbol “IHT.” The Partnership has two outstanding classes of limited partnership interests, Class A and Class B, which are identical in all respects. However, each Class A Partnership unit is convertible, at the option of the Class A holder, into one newly-issued Share of Beneficial Interest of the Trust and each Class B Partnership unit is convertible, upon approval of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, into one newly-issued Share of Beneficial Interest of the Trust. The Partnership Agreement of the Partnership subjects both general and limited partner units to certain restrictions on transfer.
 
MANAGEMENT AND LICENSING CONTRACTS
 
The Trust directly manages the Hotels through the Trust’s wholly-owned subsidiary, InnSuites Hotels, Inc. Under the management agreements, InnSuites Hotels manages the daily operations of the two Hotels and the Tempe Hotel. All Trust managed Hotel expenses, revenues and reimbursements among the Trust, InnSuites Hotels and the Partnership have been eliminated in consolidation. The management fees for the Hotels and the Tempe Hotel are 5% of room revenue and a monthly accounting fee of $2,000 per hotel. These agreements have no expiration dates, but may be cancelled by either party with 90-days written notice, or potentially sooner in the event the property changes ownership.

The Trust also provides the use of the “InnSuites” trademark to the Hotels and the Tempe Hotel through the Trust’s wholly-owned subsidiary, InnSuites Hotels, Inc., which is included in the management fee. The InnSuites trademark expires in January 2027.
 
These revenues are included in the management and trademark fees revenues in the consolidated statement of operations of our financial statements.
 
MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTS
 
InnSuites Hotels has entered into membership agreements with Best Western International, Inc. (“Best Western”) with respect to each of the two Hotels. In exchange for use of the Best Western name, trademark and reservation system, each Hotel pays marketing and reservation fees to Best Western based on reservations received through the use of the Best Western reservation system, a marketing fee based upon the monthly room revenues, and the number of available suites at the Hotels. The agreements with Best Western are year-to-year. Best Western requires that the Hotels meet certain requirements for room quality, and the two Hotels are subject to removal from the Best Western reservation system if these requirements are not met. During the past year, the two Hotels received significant reservations through the Best Western reservation system. Under these arrangements, fees paid for membership fees and reservations were approximately $277,000 and $286,000, for fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
COMPETITION IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY
 
The hotel industry is highly competitive. We expect the major challenge for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2020 (“fiscal year 2020”) to be the continuation of competition for corporate leisure group and government business in the markets in which we operate, which may affect our ability to increase room rates while maintaining market share. Each of the Hotels, and the Tempe Hotel faces competition primarily from other mid-market hotels located in its immediate vicinity, but also competes with hotel properties located in other geographic markets, and increasingly from alternative lodging facilities, such as Airbnb. While none of the Hotels’ competitors dominate any of their geographic markets, some of those competitors may have greater marketing and financial resources than the Trust.
 
Certain additional hotel property refurbishments have recently been completed by competitors in both of the Hotels’ markets, and additional hotel property developments may be built in the future. Such hotel developments have had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on the revenue of our Hotels in their respective markets.
 
The Trust’s hotel investments are located in Arizona and New Mexico. With the completed renovations at our Tucson, Arizona and Albuquerque, New Mexico hotel properties, those hotels have seen additional demand as supply has been steady in those respective markets. Either an increase in supply or a decline in demand could result in increased competition, which could have an adverse effect on occupancy, room rates and revenues of our Hotels in their respective markets.
 
The Trust may also compete for investment opportunities with other entities that have greater financial resources. These entities also may generally accept more risk than the Trust can prudently manage. Competition may generally reduce the number of suitable future investment opportunities available to the Trust and increase the bargaining power of owners seeking to sell their properties.
 
REGULATION
 
The Trust is subject to numerous federal, state and local government laws and regulations affecting the hospitality industry, including usage, building and zoning requirements and the laws and regulations related to the preparation and sale of food and beverage such as health and liquor license laws. A violation of any of those laws and regulations or increased government regulation could require the Trust to make unplanned expenditures which may result in higher operating costs. Compliance with these laws is time intensive and costly and may reduce the Trust’s revenues and operating income.

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”), all public accommodations are required to meet certain readily achievable federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. In addition to ADA work completed to date, the Trust may be required to remove additional access barriers or make unplanned, substantial modifications to its Hotels to comply with the ADA or to comply with other changes in governmental rules and regulations, or become subject to claims, fines and damage awards, any of which could reduce the number of total available rooms, increase operating costs and have a negative impact on the Trust’s results of operations.
 
Our hotel properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws that impose liability for contamination. Under these laws, governmental entities have the authority to require us, as the current or former owner of the property, to perform or pay for the clean-up of contamination (including swimming pool chemicals or hazardous substances or biological waste) at or emanating from the property and to pay for natural resource damage arising from contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination. Such liability can be joint and several, so that each covered person can be responsible for all of the costs involved, even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination. We can also be liable to private parties for costs of remediation, personal injury, death and/or property damage resulting from contamination at or emanating from our hotel properties. Moreover, environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and, therefore, an owner’s ability to borrow funds using the property as collateral or to sell the property on favorable terms or at all. Furthermore, persons who sent waste to a waste disposal facility, such as a landfill or an incinerator, may be liable for costs associated with cleanup of that facility.
 
The Trust is also subject to laws governing our relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and work permit requirements. There are frequent proposals under consideration, at the federal and state levels, to increase the minimum wage. Additional increases to the state or federal minimum wage rate, and employee benefit costs including health care or other costs associated with employees could increase expenses and result in lower operating margins.
 
The Trust collects and maintains information relating to its guests for various business purposes, including maintaining guest preferences to enhance the Trust’s customer service and for marketing and promotional purposes. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations. Compliance with applicable privacy regulations may further increase the Trust’s operating costs and/or adversely impact its ability to service its guests and market its products, properties and services to its guests. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by the Trust (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by the Trust) could result in fines or restrictions on its use or transfer of data.
 
SEASONALITY OF THE HOTEL BUSINESS
 
The Hotels’ operations historically have been somewhat seasonal. The Tucson Hotel experiences its highest occupancy in the first fiscal quarter and, to a lesser extent, the fourth fiscal quarter. The second fiscal quarter tends to be the lowest occupancy period at the Tucson Hotel. This seasonality pattern can be expected to cause fluctuations in the Trust’s quarterly revenues. The hotel located in New Mexico historically experience their most profitable periods during the second and third fiscal quarters (the summer season), providing some balance to the general seasonality of the Trust’s hotel business.
 
The seasonal nature of the Trust’s business increases its vulnerability to risks such as labor force shortages and cash flow issues. Further, if an adverse event such as an actual or threatened terrorist attack, international conflict, data breach, regional economic downturn or poor weather conditions should occur during the first or fourth fiscal quarters, the adverse impact to the Trust’s revenues could likely be greater as a result of its seasonal business.
