Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel medicines to extend the curative power of stem cell transplant, gene therapy, genome editing and cell therapy to more patients. We completed the initial public offering of our common stock in June 2018. 
 Transplant is a well-established and often curative medical procedure, and emerging data on stem cell gene therapy, which is stem cell transplant using gene-modified stem cells, suggest the potential for meaningful benefit with this newer form of transplant. Stem cell transplant and stem cell gene therapies use the same widely-adopted decades-old transplant process. As it exists today, stem cell transplant is a large market opportunity, and improvements to the current approaches could enable better stem cell transplant and extend stem cell transplant to more patients. The ability to treat patients with a stem cell transplant is limited by the challenges of obtaining sufficient cells to perform the procedure, the inherent morbidity and mortality of current methods used to prepare patients for transplant, and complications following transplant. 
 At Magenta, we believe we are uniquely positioned to overcome these challenges and to lead a new era in transplant medicine. Our portfolio of product candidates includes biologics, small molecules and a cell therapy designed to address deficiencies in existing approaches and extend the curative power of stem cell transplant, gene therapy, genome editing and cell therapy to more patients across many diseases. Currently, only a fraction of eligible patients with these diseases receive a transplant because the risks and challenges outweigh the potential for a cure. These include diseases where stem cell transplant is a standard of care (e.g., blood cancers such as acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), diseases where transplant is performed but limited in use (e.g., hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia), and autoimmune diseases. Emerging clinical data suggest that stem cell transplant may represent a breakthrough approach with curative potential for patients with severe autoimmune diseases. For example, recent results from multiple clinical trials show that patients with autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and scleroderma, can be cured with a transplant. However, based on our epidemiology analyses, currently only approximately 1 to 2% of eligible patients with multiple sclerosis or scleroderma in the United States and Europe receive a stem cell transplant. 
 To address the major unmet medical needs in the existing stem cell transplant process, we are developing a stem cell biology discovery platform and comprehensive portfolio of novel therapeutics. Our programs will improve stem cell dose (expansion), stem cell collection (mobilization), patient preparation for transplant (conditioning) and potential post-transplant complications to address key limitations of the stem cell transplant process to allow more patients to benefit. Within our expansion program, MGTA-456 is a cell therapy used with curative intent, and it has the potential to allow more patients to have a better chance for a successful stem cell transplant. We are currently studying it in patients with inherited metabolic disorders and patients with blood cancers. Within our mobilization program, MGTA-145 is focused on enabling physicians to more easily harvest a greater number of blood stem cells, known as hematopoietic stem cells or HSCs, from patients and donors to improve patient outcomes and scale the capacity of transplant and apheresis centers. Our targeted transplant conditioning programs, which prepare the patient for transplant, are designed to selectively remove stem and/or immune cells from a patient prior to transplant, and to be far less toxic than the decades-old radiation and chemotherapy-based approaches which are still the only available options. Our post-transplant complications program is designed to target the donor immune cells within the patient that cause Graft vs. Host Disease, or GvHD, which can be a fatal complication of transplant.

 We intend to become a fully integrated discovery, development and commercial company in the field of transplant medicine. We believe that our product portfolio will offer significant commercial synergies. We are developing our products so that they can each be used individually or in combination with each other. As a result, our portfolio could be utilized in a manner tailored to the patients disease, such that a patient may receive more than one Magenta therapy as part of their individual transplant journey. 
 Our goal is to have three clinical programs moving forward in multiple indications by 2020, with a rapidly advancing portfolio and sustainable platform. 
 Background on Stem Cell Transplant 
 Bone marrow is the tissue inside the bones where HSCs are located. HSCs produce all of the cells in the blood and immune systems, including: T cells and B cells to fight infections; red blood cells to carry oxygen; and platelets to control bleeding. The bone marrow is highly active, and gives rise to billions of new cells every day. However, abnormal functioning of the system can lead to serious and sometimes fatal blood and immune diseases. The aim of stem cell transplant, also called HSC transplant or bone marrow transplant, is to replace the diseased blood and immune cells with new stem cells that will produce new blood and immune cells, thereby effectively resetting the blood and immune systems to a healthy state. Stem cell transplant is a well-established procedure with curative intent, rooted in decades of clinical experience. 
 Starting from the first procedure in 1956, more than 1 million patients with blood cancers and genetic diseases worldwide have undergone a stem cell transplant, and currently approximately 65,000 patients undergo the procedure annually. Stem cell transplant serves as the standard of care in many blood cancers, such as leukemias, lymphomas and multiple myeloma; and for rare genetic diseases such as Hurler syndrome and is the only curative option for sickle cell disease. 
 However, stem cell transplant is a complex procedure that carries significant risks, including serious complications such as infection, secondary cancers and even patient death. A majority of patients who could significantly benefit from or be cured by a transplant do not receive one primarily because of the toxicity and risks associated with the procedure. For example, primarily because of these risks, approximately two out of three eligible patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia do not receive a transplant despite it being the standard of care. For debilitating but non-life-threatening diseases, such as sickle cell disease and multiple sclerosis, even fewer patients are offered and receive a transplant because the risks of the current transplant procedure often outweigh the potential benefits. There is a clear need to improve the safety and efficacy of transplant so that we can refocus the patient and physician conversation and bring the curative power of transplant to more patients. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our mission and our culture are centered around the goal of enabling more patients with severe or life-threatening diseases to have access to the transformative benefit of a stem cell transplant. We intend to provide physicians with a tailored, multi-product treatment regimen based on the disease setting and the individual needs of each patient. Our strategic priorities are as follows: 
 Bring the curative power of stem cell transplant, gene therapy, genome editing and cell therapy to all patients who can benefit by advancing an integrated product portfolio: We believe we are the only company that is committed to addressing the major limitations and challenges of stem cell transplant and transplant-based therapies, such as stem cell gene therapy, to revolutionize this entire field of medicine. Our product engine is generating a comprehensive portfolio of therapies to optimize the stem cell transplant process. Our initial focus is on inherited genetic diseases, blood cancers and autoimmune diseases, and we also plan to address other diseases for which transplant could represent a one-time, curative treatment.

 Build on our deep expertise in stem cell biology to lead a new era in transplant medicine: We have assembled a group of world leaders and pioneers in the fields of stem cell biology, biotherapeutics and transplant medicine. With this team, we are converting recent scientific breakthroughs into a product engine for stem cell transplant therapies. 
 Create a fully integrated patient-focused biotechnology company: We are building a fully integrated biotechnology company with end-to-end capabilities in research, development and commercialization, and we believe the broad and synergistic nature of our portfolio will allow us to address many of the significant limitations of stem cell transplant and transplant-based therapies. 
 Commercialize our therapeutics to bring tailored transplant solutions to physicians and patients: We are developing our portfolio of products so that they can be used individually or in combination with each other, such that a patient may receive more than one Magenta therapy as part of their individual patient journey. Our commercial model centers around hospital-based prescribers, and this is consistent across all of the products in our portfolio. Stem cell transplants are performed in a few hundred accredited medical centers in the U.S. and Europe, with more than half of the U.S. procedures performed at the top 20% of transplant centers. We believe the synergies among our programs and the well-defined structure of the current stem cell transplant provider network will allow us to commercialize all of our own therapeutics in the U.S. and Europe through a focused, targeted commercial organization. 
 Leverage our two most advanced product candidates, MGTA-456 and MGTA-145, as clinical catalysts and commercial beachheads for our portfolio: In addition to the potential to bring meaningful clinical benefit to patients, MGTA-456 and MGTA-145 provide strategic value to Magenta by allowing us to accelerate the build-out of our clinical development infrastructure and footprint and to establish key customer relationships that will be important for future commercialization of all of our products. 
 Continue to integrate our innovative collaboration with Be The Match with our science, medicine and business approaches: Be The Match is a leading patient-focused stem cell transplant organization in the U.S. Because of our shared patient focus, we and Be The Match have established a broad, first-of-its-kind collaboration. This collaboration positions us as a partner with high-priority access to many services that will continue to enable us to establish relationships across transplant centers and with key transplant physicians. Through our partnership, we access clinical strategy support; clinical development operational support, including a unique cell supply platform that is very well established at Be The Match and which will also enable our commercialization efforts across several programs. We also have access to the Be The Match payer and policy group to inform and support our pricing and reimbursement plans across the portfolio. 
 Strategically collaborate to realize the full potential of our portfolio: We currently retain 100% of the commercial rights for our products, including all uses of MGTA-456 other than gene-modified stem cells. We will evaluate additional collaborations to: 
 

 | maximize the patient impact of our portfolio by partnering to enable gene and cell therapies, including stem cell-based gene therapies, genome editing and CAR T therapy;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | build relationships with partners to access complementary expertise and capabilities to bring our therapies as quickly as possible to all patients who can benefit; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | opportunistically bring in preclinical or clinical assets that fit with our integrated portfolio.

Stem Cell Transplant: The Process and Challenges 
 A stem cell transplant procedure utilizes a number of integrated steps, which we highlight below: stem cell sourcing and collection, patient conditioning and stem cell infusion and engraftment. All transplants are categorized as either autologous or allogeneic, depending on the source of cells for the transplant. In an 
 
7 


  autologous transplant, used for conditions such as multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and autoimmune diseases, the patients own stem cells are used. In the case of stem cell gene therapy and genome editing, once the cells are collected from the patient, they are then modified to either insert a functioning gene or correct a defective gene. 
 In an allogeneic transplant, used for conditions such as acute leukemia and genetic diseases, patients receive cells from a stem cell donor or umbilical cord blood. 
 Step 1: Stem Cell Sourcing and Collection 
 Once the patient and physician agree that stem cell transplant is the best treatment option, first the source of stem cells must be identified and then the cells are collected. There are three sources of stem cells for transplant: 

 | extraction from the bone marrow, which requires a procedure performed under general anesthesia where cells are withdrawn directly from the bone marrow with needle aspirates;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | mobilization into the peripheral blood, which currently requires several days of injections of a drug or combination of drugs to mobilize the cells, or move them from the bone marrow into the bloodstream, where they are then collected through a process called apheresis; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | harvesting from umbilical cord blood units, which are stored in cord blood banks.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Challenges 
 Finding a donor: For patients undergoing autologous transplant, the patients own cells are used for the transplant. For patients requiring an allogeneic transplant, the preferred source of stem cells is a donor from their family who has a well-matched immune system. For patients without a matched, related donor, the second option is a matched, unrelated donor identified through the bone marrow donor registry. Although there are nearly 35 million registered bone marrow donors worldwide, nearly half of all patients are unable to find a matched donor. Of the matched donors identified for patients, almost half decline to donate, which reduces the chance for finding a well-matched donor for the patient. 
 Stem cell collection: It is critical that physicians obtain enough stem cells for the transplant or gene therapy, whether from a patient or a donor, as higher cell doses are closely correlated to better patient outcomes. In some cases, multiple invasive bone marrow harvests are needed to obtain an adequate number of stem cells. The autologous transplant field has moved away from bone marrow harvest to stem cell mobilization in recent years due to the difficulty of the harvest procedure for both patients and physicians. In the case of stem cell mobilization, current treatments involve repeated injections over the course of several days and are often associated with bone pain, nausea, headache, and fatigue. Another challenge associated with current mobilization approaches is the difficulty of predicting whether mobilization will be successful, especially in heavily treated blood cancer patients. In fact, most patients require multiple days of apheresis and some patients require more than one mobilization procedure to obtain a sufficient number of cells for transplant. Additionally, mobilization failure rates for autologous transplants are as high as 40%. 
 For patients without a matched donor, other options include mismatched donors, who can either be unrelated or related; however, transplant outcomes are not optimal with these donor types. For patients without a matched, related donor, umbilical cord blood also provides a potential source of stem cells that is readily available. However, despite the utility of this approach, there are significant challenges with umbilical cord blood transplant. Even when patients find matched cord blood units, transplants are severely limited because there are often too few stem cells in the cord blood unit. Although more than 712,000 units are available in the worldwide cord blood inventory, current cell dose requirements mean that fewer than approximately 4% of these units contain enough stem cells for use in adult patients. Because so few units are suitable for use in adult patients, the patient is less likely to find a closely matched cord blood unit, leading to less than optimal transplant outcomes.

 Step 2: Conditioning 
 Once sufficient cells have been obtained, the patient is then conditioned for transplant using systemic, toxic chemotherapy and/or radiation. Depending on the disease and type of transplant, the conditioning treatment is intended to remove or deplete: 

 | existing stem cells in the bone marrow to provide space for the incoming stem cells;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | immune cells (T cells and B cells) to prevent rejection of the incoming cells or remove disease-causing autoimmune cells; and/or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | cancer cells to prevent disease relapse in patients with blood cancers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

Challenges 
 Conditioning toxicity: Stem cell transplant and gene therapy conditioning is very burdensome and risky for both pediatric and adult patients. Conditioning treatments today are typically non-targeted and involve systemic, toxic chemotherapy and/or radiation. Most of these genotoxic chemotherapy agents, including derivatives of mustard gas, were discovered more than 50 years ago and were never intended for stem cell transplant conditioning. The current treatments eradicate the stem and immune cells and diseased cells but also indiscriminately damage DNA and kill normal, healthy cells in the body, which can lead to severe infections, organ failure, infertility, secondary cancers and even death. Nearly all transplant patients experience complications as a result of current conditioning treatments, and conditioning toxicity is responsible for up to 35% of mortality following allogeneic transplants. The severe immediate and long-term side effects and mortality risk of conditioning are among the major barriers preventing stem cell transplants from being performed more widely in other diseases where they may be curative. Efforts to reduce chemotherapy doses have met with some success, but the most commonly used conditioning regimens all involve the use of genotoxic agents. 
Step 3: Stem Cell Infusion and Engraftment 
 Once conditioning is complete, the stem cells are infused into the patient via the bloodstream. The cells travel to the bone marrow and engraft there, meaning they lodge in the bone marrow and begin to make new blood and immune cells. Once the bone marrow has made enough blood cells  particularly white blood cells to fight infection  which typically takes several weeks, the patient can be discharged from the hospital. There are instances where the stem cells do not engraft or are rejected by the patients body, leading to prolonged hospitalization and the need for an additional transplant. Outcomes of additional transplants are typically very poor. 
Challenges 
 Transplant rejection: A major complication of stem cell transplant is when the infused stem cells are rejected by the patients body. Rejection is a particular problem where stem cell doses are low, for example with cord blood transplants. 
 Delayed engraftment: Depending on the dose of stem cells infused, engraftment can take between two to six weeks. During this period, patients are required to be in specialized isolation rooms at the hospital and are susceptible to infections. 
 Graft vs. Host Disease: GvHD is a reaction that commonly develops after an allogeneic stem cell transplant and is a result of the donor immune cells recognizing the patients cells as foreign and attacking them. Acute GvHD typically occurs within weeks of a patient receiving a stem cell transplant and can severely damage the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal system. GvHD accounts for approximately 10% of deaths following allogeneic transplant.

 Transplant Patient Journey 
 

Our Solutions 
 We are applying our expertise in stem cell biology and biotherapeutics discovery to bring innovative, modern medicines to the transplant field through our programs, specifically designed to address each of the key challenges of the stem cell transplant journey for patients: 

 | Conditioning (targeted conditioning programs): Our targeted transplant conditioning programs are designed to selectively eliminate stem and/or immune cells from a patient prior to transplant or gene therapy, and to be far less toxic than the current radiation and chemotherapy-based treatments. These programs focus on developing targeted products that deplete specific cell types, with an approach that is tailored to the patients disease and transplant requirements.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Stem cell mobilization (mobilization program): Our stem cell mobilization program is focused on enabling physicians to more easily collect larger numbers of high-quality HSCs from patients and donors to yield higher cell doses and better outcomes for transplant as well as gene therapy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Stem cell source and engraftment challenges (expansion programs): Our stem cell expansion programs are focused on generating higher cell doses, which have been shown to improve the speed and success of engraftment in stem cell transplant and improve disease outcomes. Our AHR antagonist, E478, uses the same mechanism used to manufacture MGTA-456 to expand gene-modified HSCs for gene therapy and genome editing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | GvHD (post-transplant complications program): Our post-transplant program is designed to target the donor immune cells within the patient that cause GvHD, potentially reducing the occurrence of GvHD without sacrificing the benefits of an allogeneic transplant, broadening access to the curative potential of transplant.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Current Programs 
 We are developing a pipeline of small molecules; biologics, including antibody drug conjugates; and a cell therapy, which we believe can meaningfully improve and expand curative stem cell transplant options for many more patients with autoimmune diseases, blood cancers and genetic diseases. Our portfolio of novel medicines for transplant has the potential to allow more patients with debilitating or life-threatening diseases to access a one-time, transformative stem cell transplant with better outcomes, less toxicity risk and less mortality risk. We 
 
10 


  are developing our product candidates so that they can each be used individually or in combination with each other, such that a patient may receive more than one Magenta therapy as part of their individual transplant journey. In addition to our first set of clinical and preclinical product candidates, we are in the process of identifying several other potential candidates from our discovery programs. Our goal is to have three distinct clinical programs in multiple indications by 2020 with a series of data read-outs. 
 Our Pipeline 
 

Our IND-Enabling and Clinical-Stage Product Candidates 
 C100, C200, C300: targeted antibody-drug conjugates for conditioning 
 We are developing a suite of novel antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs, for transplant conditioning, a step in the transplant process that is still dominated by the use of systemic chemotherapy agents and radiation. We are seeking to replace these non-targeted toxic conditioning agents with targeted ADCs. These drugs are designed for transplant and specifically deplete only the cell types required to be eliminated in order to perform a successful transplant. Certain ADCs are currently used to treat cancer by directing a toxin to specific cells using antibodies. Our programs are adapting this clinically validated modality for conditioning patients for stem cell transplant. 
 All of our conditioning programs share an ADC platform but differ in the targeted cell types. The C100 program targets HSCs, immune cells, and disease-causing cells, the C200 program targets HSCs and disease-
 
11 


  causing cells and the C300 program targets only immune cells. This is achieved by tuning the antibodies to specific cellular markers or receptors that are expressed on the particular cell types. 
 

The first conditioning program in our portfolio is C100, under which we are developing ADCs that specifically deplete host HSCs and immune cells. Within our C100 program, our lead target is CD45, an important cell surface molecule broadly expressed throughout the hematopoietic and immune systems. We plan to develop C100 for use in patients with autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and scleroderma, and patients with leukemias and lymphomas. We plan to declare a development candidate in our C100 program in 2019, then move into investigational new drug, or IND, enabling studies in 2020. 
 Our most advanced conditioning program, C200, is designed to specifically deplete HSCs and disease-causing cells. Our lead ADC product candidate targets CD117, also known as c-Kit, which is highly expressed on HSCs and leukemia cells, making it an ideal target for conditioning across broad sets of diseases. This includes blood cancers as well as hemoglobinopathies like sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, with potential applicability in both stem cell transplant and stem cell gene therapy. We have declared a development candidate in our C200 program and have moved into IND-enabling studies. We plan to file the IND, for this program in 2020. 
 Our third ADC-based conditioning program, C300, targets T cells, a type of immune cell. T cell depletion is currently performed with highly toxic, non-specific drugs which can lead to immune deficiency, infections and other complications including secondary autoimmune reactions. We are pursuing targets expressed on the surfaces of T cells with the goal of offering a safer and more optimized targeted conditioning approach through T cell depletion before CAR T therapy for blood cancers, prevention of stem cell rejection prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant or achievement of immune system reset before autologous stem cell transplant in patients with autoimmune diseases. 
 MGTA-145: CXCR2 agonist combined with plerixafor for HSC mobilization 
 Approximately 85% of stem cell transplants, or approximately 55,000 transplants per year in the U.S. and Europe, use mobilized peripheral blood from either donors or patients themselves as a source of stem cells. MGTA-145 is a novel stem cell mobilization product candidate that was developed based on our understanding of the physiological mechanisms that control stem cell mobilization. The goal of MGTA-145 is to achieve high levels of stem cell mobilization in patients and donors in the first-line setting and replace the current standard of care for mobilization, a drug known as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, or G-CSF. G-CSF is a glycoprotein that mobilizes stem cells indirectly and comes with limitations that include a prolonged treatment period of up to one week of injections, lack of efficacy in some patients, and significant bone pain. MGTA-145 is a CXCR2 agonist protein that activates neutrophils to release proteases that cause the release of HSCs into the blood. This novel mechanism of action is synergistic with and complementary to that of plerixafor, another commonly used mobilization agent marketed by Sanofi. Plerixafor acts as a small molecule CXCR4 antagonist, blocking a pathway that otherwise plays an essential role in attracting and retaining HSCs in the bone marrow.
 
12 


 We plan to start the first clinical trial of MGTA-145 in the first half of 2019. This Phase 1 trial will study MGTA-145 plus plerixafor in healthy subjects. We plan to develop MGTA-145 for mobilization first in patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and in healthy donors for allogeneic transplant. We also plan to study MGTA-145 in related and unrelated donors for allogeneic transplant; in patient populations where G-CSF can exacerbate the disease, such as autoimmune diseases; and patient populations where G-CSF is contra-indicated, such as sickle cell disease. 
 MGTA-456: cell therapy based on aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) antagonist expanded stem cells 
 MGTA-456 is a novel proprietary allogeneic stem cell therapy that was developed based on our understanding of the mechanisms that control stem cell growth. 
 Larger stem cell doses and better matched transplants are both correlated with successful transplant outcomes, reduced risk of transplant failure, and faster time to engraftment and immune recovery. The goal of MGTA-456 is to allow more patients to have a successful transplant through higher doses of cells that are well matched to the patient. 
 We have initiated a Phase 2 study of MGTA-456 in patients with inherited metabolic disorders and intend to explore other debilitating diseases where we believe MGTA-456 could bring transformative benefit to patients. Although transplant can be curative in these diseases, between approximately 20 to 30% of patients with inherited metabolic diseases treated with transplant experience engraftment failure, resulting in severe complications, including death. We believe the high number of HSCs present in MGTA-456 should speed engraftment, reduce or eliminate engraftment failure and improve patient outcomes. Early results in patients with inherited metabolic disorders treated with MGTA-456 have shown promising signs of clinical benefit. If the results from this trial are favorable, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 trial in 2020. 
 MGTA-456 originally achieved human proof-of-concept in a Phase 1/2 study in patients with blood cancers. Data from the study showed that the median expansion of stem cells from the original cord blood unit was 330-fold, and all 36 patients treated with MGTA-456 in the study successfully achieved engraftment of these expanded stem cells. We are adding to the body of data for MGTA-456 in blood cancers through an investigator-initiated Phase 2 study in blood cancers at the University of Minnesota, which was initiated in December 2018. We anticipate that this study will triple the number of patients with blood cancers undergoing myeloablative conditioning who have been treated with MGTA-456, build experience with the cryopreserved formulation of MGTA-456 and help inform the design of further Company-sponsored studies. 
 We have also explored the possibility of studying MGTA-456 in patients with sickle cell disease. After careful review of comprehensive transplant outcomes data in sickle cell disease from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, or CIBMTR, we have concluded that the current transplant process will require optimization through targeted conditioning programs before MGTA-456 could deliver maximum clinical benefit to patients with sickle cell disease. We will continue our focus on advancing our potentially transformative conditioning and mobilization programs for patients with sickle cell disease. 
 On April 11, 2018, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for MGTA-456 for the enhancement of cell engraftment in patients receiving stem cell transplant. 
 We are the sponsor of the IND for MGTA-456 in inherited metabolic diseases. The IND was originally filed by Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd, or Novartis, on November 6, 2015 and formally transferred to us on July 25, 2017. The IND is active and up to date with reporting requirements, such as annual reports. We obtained the rights to MGTA-456 through an April 2017 license agreement with Novartis granting us the sole worldwide rights to research, develop and commercialize certain AHR antagonist compounds specifically for the expansion of cord blood-derived non-gene-edited/-modified HSCs. See Licenses and Collaborations section. 
 
13 


 E478: AHR antagonist for expansion of gene-modified stem cells 
 E478 is a novel and proprietary small molecule AHR antagonist that was developed to increase the number of gene-modified HSCs ex vivo for stem cell based-gene therapy. Gene therapy, or stem cell transplant with gene-modified or genome-edited cells, is a promising treatment approach for several diseases. However, this approach is significantly limited by the inability to generate a sufficient dose of gene-modified HSCs that retain the ability to engraft in patients as well as the cost and complexity of manufacturing viral vectors for gene modification of cells. These constraints could limit the commercial viability of this approach. E478 uses the same clinically validated mechanism as MGTA-456 to expand gene-modified HSCs. In addition to addressing cell dose limitations, the ability to expand long-term repopulating HSCs ex vivo has the potential to reduce manufacturing costs for these therapies by requiring less viral vector for gene modification of the stem cells. At the ASH annual meeting in December 2017, we presented data showing that culturing gene-modified human HSCs with E478 increased the number of gene-modified stem cells that retained engraftment ability in preclinical models. We are developing E478 specifically to partner with gene therapy and genome editing companies. E478 would be integrated into our potential partners cell-based products leading to a newly defined cell therapy. 
 G100: ADC program for prevention of acute GvHD 
 We are developing a unique approach to preventing acute GvHD, a major complication and a leading cause of death in allogeneic transplantation. GvHD occurs when alloreactive T cells in the donor stem cell graft recognize the patient as foreign and attack their tissues. Current treatments for acute GvHD prevention include the prophylactic use of non-specific immune suppressive agents. The use of high doses of non-specific immune suppressive agents for GvHD treatment is correlated with an increased risk of infection and poor immune function, and despite the use of these powerful immune suppressive agents, approximately 50 to 80% of allogeneic transplant patients will experience acute GvHD. Our G100 program is designed to selectively eliminate only the components of the graft that cause acute GvHD, specifically the alloreactive T cells. This ADC therapy is intended to be dosed in vivo at the time of transplant. By specifically targeting the alloreactive T cells that arise shortly after transplant, this therapy should spare the remainder of the patients immune system to allow immune recovery and protection from infections.

 Background on Our Current Programs 
 


Targeted Conditioning Programs 
 Unmet need 
 For patients undergoing stem cell transplant, the toxicity and mortality associated with current conditioning protocols are significant challenges and prevent more patients from benefitting from a life-saving and potentially curative transplant procedure. In many diseases, physicians have needed to use the most aggressive conditioning regimens to generate the best efficacy outcomes for transplant and transplant-based therapies, such as stem cell gene therapy. 
 Conditioning treatments today are typically non-targeted and involve high doses of radiation and/or toxic chemotherapy. These chemotherapy agents, including derivatives of mustard gas, were discovered more than 50 years ago and were never intended for stem cell transplant conditioning. The current treatments eradicate the stem and immune cells and diseased cells but also indiscriminately damage the DNA and kill normal, healthy cells in the body. These conditioning regimens can cause long-term lung injury and liver toxicity, serious infections, organ failure, infertility, secondary cancers and even death. Nearly all transplant patients experience complications as a result of current conditioning treatments, and conditioning toxicity is responsible for up to 35% of mortality following allogeneic transplants. 
 Emerging clinical data have shown that we are now at a stage where autoimmune disease can be cured with an autologous stem cell transplant, with recent data in multiple sclerosis and scleroderma. However, the toxicity of the required conditioning regimens has historically led many physicians to conclude that the risks of transplant in these patient populations far outweigh the benefits. A pair of comprehensive reviews published in 2017 in Nature journals summarized the clinical transplant results in multiple sclerosis and broader rheumatic autoimmune diseases. The main conclusions from this combined experience in more than 3,000 patients during the past 20 years were that the therapeutic benefit of stem cell transplant is significant across multiple studies in 
 
15 


  severe autoimmune diseases: Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, or RRMS, (five Phase 2 trials) and systemic sclerosis (two Phase 2 trials and two randomized trials) have the most clinical evidence using stringent disease endpoints. When compared to the standard of care in RRMS, certain studies have shown that the proportion of patients with clinical benefit at two years appears to be double that of the next best treatment. Another study showed complete long-term suppression of all inflammatory activity in a cohort of patients with active and progressing multiple sclerosis who received a stem cell transplant, and a third study compared transplant to disease-modifying therapies and found that transplant resulted in prolonged time to disease progression. Given a stem cell transplants ability to durably eliminate relapses and disease activity in multiple sclerosis patients, we believe a safer transplant procedure would be a viable option for those patients with highly active disease beyond what therapeutics can manage. However, currently only approximately 1 to 2% of eligible patients with multiple sclerosis and scleroderma in the U.S. and Europe receive a stem cell transplant primarily because the risk of the procedure outweighs the benefits of a potential cure. We believe we can significantly expand the number of autoimmune patients who can benefit from transplant.

The lines continue until the latest follow-up assessment, death (cross), or censoring because the patient received a conventional, experimental, or unproven treatment (star). The lines begin at diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, inverted triangles denote a clinical relapse. 
 In January 2018, a paper was published in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrating that hematopoietic stem cell transplant with myeloablative conditioning for patients with scleroderma resulted in long-term benefit, including improved event-free and overall survival; however, these benefits came with increased toxicity due to the non-targeted myeloablative conditioning used in the study. 
 Our solution 
 We are developing a suite of novel ADCs for transplant conditioning. We are seeking to replace the current non-targeted toxic conditioning agents with targeted ADCs designed for transplant that specifically deplete only the cell types required to be eliminated in order to perform a successful transplant. While ADCs are an established treatment for certain cancers, we believe this is the first time that ADC technology has been harnessed for transplant medicine. These programs have the potential to expand the curative power of transplant to every eligible patient, as well as beyond the eligible patient populations to patients who cannot tolerate current conditioning regimens. This includes patients with autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, where the current risk-benefit of transplant is not considered favorable due to the toxicity of the existing conditioning regimens. 
 ADCs are a technology developed over the past 20 years where a monoclonal antibody specific for a cell surface protein is coupled to a drug. The ADC binds the receptor on the target cell, is internalized and degraded 
 
17 


  to release the drug into the target cell. Coupling the drug to the antibody increases the specificity of drug delivery to the target cell, reducing systemic exposure and increasing the safety and efficacy compared to delivering the drug alone or the antibody without the drug attached. Today most ADCs are directed toward treating cancer cells expressing specific target receptors enriched on tumor cells. Our programs build on this clinically validated modality and adapt it for conditioning patients for stem cell transplant. 
 

Targeted conditioning is more specific compared to traditional conditioning. Traditional conditioning is performed with total body irradiation and chemotherapy which eliminates all hematopoietic cells and nonspecifically damages other organs. Targeted conditioning with an antibody drug conjugate specifically eliminates the hematopoietic stem cells while sparing the immune system and avoiding systemic side effects. 
 In our development of ADCs for use in conditioning, we are optimizing for several key parameters: 
 

 | First, the antibody must specifically target a receptor that is expressed on the cells of interest, but not on other cell types.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Second, to comply with typical stem cell transplant conditioning timelines, the antibody must have suitable efficacy to ensure that the ADC is able to kill the target cells rapidly, in days rather than weeks or months.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Third, the antibody clearance needs to be accelerated so that it is eliminated by the time the transplanted cells are infused into the patient, typically within a week of starting conditioning. This requirement stems from the fact that the target receptor is expressed on cells present in the patient but also on the similar cell types in the transplanted cells.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Finally, the linker-drug must be able to kill non-dividing cells as most HSC and immune cells are not actively dividing. The ADC linker must be chosen to minimize damage to non-target cells.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are addressing each of these requirements through careful selection of the appropriate target receptor as well as antibody properties, including binding site, affinity, half-life and linker toxin. 
 We are developing three distinct programs for conditioning that specifically deplete the particular cells that need to be removed to make room for the incoming cells. These programs share a common platform but differ in the cell types targeted: The C100 program targets HSCs, immune cells and disease-causing cells, the C200 
 
18 


  program targets HSCs and disease-causing cells and the C300 program targets only immune cells. The lead antigen targets for C100 and C200 and potential applications for each program are listed in the table below. 
 

C100 program 
 The first conditioning program in our portfolio is C100, under which we are developing ADCs that specifically deplete host HSCs and immune cells. Within our C100 program, our lead target is CD45, an important cell surface molecule broadly expressed throughout the hematopoietic and immune system. We are currently in the lead identification stage for this program and intend to declare a development candidate in 2019, then move into IND-enabling studies in 2020. 
 C100-targeting HSC and immune cells 
For many applications of HSC transplant, it is important to eliminate both immune cells and HSCs in the patient prior to transplant. This is especially important in the allogeneic setting where host immune cells can elicit an immune-mediated rejection of the incoming foreign stem cells. In addition, immune cell depletion is a key feature of the use of autologous transplant for the treatment of severe autoimmune disease. In this case, the goal is to eliminate the pathogenic auto-reactive immune cells that perpetuate the underlying autoimmune disease. Lastly, for patients with tumors expressing CD45, there may also be a direct anti-tumor effect providing additional therapeutic benefit. For these reasons, we are developing therapeutics that simultaneously target both HSCs and immune cells. 
 Pioneering work from Magenta founding scientists demonstrates that HSCs can be successfully targeted using a CD45-ADC to facilitate syngeneic transplant and allow for transplant-mediated cure of a mouse model of sickle cell disease. Importantly, CD45-ADC-treated mice show greatly reduced levels of organ damage and faster immune cell reconstitution and infection control compared to mice conditioned using radiation.

 CD45SAP has potent cell-depletion activity and enables efficient donor-cell engraftment. (A) CD45SAP depletes HSCs in C57BL/6 mice whereas non-biotinylated CD45 antibody in the presence of streptavidin SAP does not. Data represent mean ± s.d. (n = 5 mice/group, one of two independent experiments shown). HSCs were assessed by flow cytometry (Lin-cKit+Sca1+CD48-CD150+). (B) Long-term assessment of peripheral blood chimerism following CD45.2 GFP cell transplantation 8 days post CD45SAP conditioning; all data points significant vs. control (P < 0.05). Data represent mean ± s.d. (n = 5 mice/group, assayed individually). 
 To translate these initial mouse studies into human therapeutics, we have deployed our biotherapeutics and stem cell biology platforms to discover and develop anti-human CD45 ADCs. These platforms include antibody discovery campaigns to identify high-affinity antibodies able to bind to human CD45 protein and cell lines expressing CD45. Conjugation of these candidate antibodies to select toxins and testing in functional killing assays in cell lines expressing CD45 and human HSCs growing in vitro is used to select lead antibodies for characterization in vivo. 
 We have developed CD45-amanitin ADC, an ADC using amanitin, an RNA polymerase II inhibitor capable of depleting cycling and non-cycling cells. In data presented at the Annual Meeting of the Transplant and Cellular Therapy, or TCT, in February 2019, we demonstrated that a single administration of CD45-amanitin ADC is capable of potent killing of CD34+CD90+ HSCs in vitro; depletion of human immune cells and CD34+ cells in the bone marrow of humanized NSG mice; and depletion of immune cells and CD34+ cells in the bone marrow of non-human primates.

 In additional data presented at the TCT meeting in 2019, the anti-CD45 amanitin ADC showed potent killing of human HSCs and human leukemia cell lines expressing CD45 in vitro. A single dose of CD45-amanitin ADC showed potent in vivo anti-leukemia activity in mice bearing established human leukemia cell lines. A single dose of the ADC also significantly improved the survival of mice engrafted with human leukemia cells 
 
20 


  from acute myeloid leukemia patients, including leukemias that were resistant to multiple lines of therapy including previous allogeneic stem cell transplant. 
 


Single Dose of Anti-CD45-Amanitin ADC Shows Potent Anti-Leukemia Activity in Patient-Derived Acute Myeloid Leukemia Models. 
 The CD45-amanitin ADC was well tolerated at the efficacious dose with no significant change in liver enzymes or other clinical chemistry parameters. 
 We anticipate nominating a development candidate for the C100 program in 2019, then beginning IND-enabling studies in 2020. 
 Clinical development plans 
We believe C100 has the potential to increase the number of eligible patients who receive a transplant and expand the number of patients who are eligible. Non-genotoxic conditioning with a CD45-ADC may provide a novel approach for safer conditioning prior to stem cell transplant and greatly increase the number of patients eligible for a stem cell transplant. We believe a CD45-ADC may have applications in stem cell transplant for patients with autoimmune diseases and acute leukemias. 
 Multiple sclerosis affects approximately 600,000 to 700,000 patients in the U.S. and historically at least 650,000 patients in Europe. Approximately 15,000 new patients in the U.S. and 32,000 new patients in Europe are diagnosed annually. To assess eligibility in this population, we focused on the patients with active relapsing-remitting disease and relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patients who are not adequately treated by current therapies. This population represents approximately 45,000 multiple sclerosis patients who switch therapies each year in the U.S., and we believe that a greater population of patients switch therapies each year in Europe. Many of these patients switch because their current therapy does not adequately control disease activity that causes relapses. Given stem cell transplants ability to durably eliminate relapses and disease activity in multiple sclerosis patients, we believe a safer transplant procedure would be a viable option for those patients with highly active disease beyond what therapeutics offer. Currently only approximately 1 to 2% of eligible multiple sclerosis patients in the U.S. and Europe receive a stem cell transplant because the risk of the process outweighs the benefits of a potential cure, and we believe we can significantly expand this number. 
 Scleroderma, a severe chronic connective tissue disease that is characterized by thickening of the skin and fibrosis in multiple organs, is diagnosed in approximately 6,600 patients in the U.S. and 10,900 patients in Europe annually. Approximately 35% (2,300 patients in U.S., 3,800 patients in Europe) of scleroderma patients suffer from the diffuse cutaneous form of the disease and are therefore eligible for stem cell transplant. Currently, 
 
21 


  only approximately 1% or less of eligible scleroderma patients in the U.S. and Europe receive a stem cell transplant, though the recent inclusion of stem cell transplant in the European League Against Rheumatism, or EULAR, treatment guidelines for scleroderma may increase this number. With this increased acceptance of stem cell transplant as a treatment option for scleroderma and the opportunity for a safer transplant procedure through targeted conditioning, we believe transplant could become a new standard of care for patients with severe scleroderma, who have no other therapeutic options available. 
 There are approximately 72,000 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed in the U.S. each year, of which approximately 6,500 are eligible for transplant; and in Europe there are approximately 95,000 new cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma each year, with 8,500 eligible for transplant. Of these patients, approximately 60 to 80% receive a transplant. Approximately 47,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe are diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia every year. Of those patients, about 60% achieve remission with chemotherapy agents and are eligible for transplant. However, of these, only approximately 30 to 40% actually receive a transplant. This is largely due to the toxicity risk associated with current conditioning protocols. We believe our conditioning agents would allow more patients to achieve remission and become eligible for transplant. 
 

C200 program Our most advanced conditioning program, C200, is designed to specifically deplete HSCs and disease-causing cells. Our development candidate ADC targets CD117, also known as c-Kit, which is expressed on HSCs, making it an ideal target for conditioning across broad sets of diseases. This includes blood cancers, hemoglobinopathies (sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia), and inherited metabolic diseases, with potential applicability in both stem cell transplant and HSC based gene therapy. | Based on: Nobili et.al., Long non-coding RNAs in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Oncotarget (2016).

 Initial experiments validated the concept of targeting CD117 using mouse models of HSC conditioning and transplant. In these studies, we found that a single dose of CD117-ADC was able to successfully deplete HSC in immunocompetent mice and allow successful transplant. 
 
22 


 Based on these data, we commenced antibody discovery and optimization to develop an anti-human CD117-ADC. At the TCT conference in February 2019 we presented preclinical data showing that our CD117-ADC conjugated with amanitin potently depleted human and non-human primate HSCs and progenitors in vivo. 
 


Engineered Anti-CD117-amanitin ADC Effectively Depletes HSC in Cynomolgus Monkeys. HSC numbers in the bone marrow seven days following a single dose of CD117-ADC or unconjugated CD117 antibody (CD117). The optimized CD117 amanitin ADC was able to eliminate 95% of HSCs in the bone marrow following a single dose of 0.3mg/kg. In contrast, treatment with an unconjugated CD117 antibody did not have a significant impact on HSCs. 
 In addition to dose-dependent depletion of HSCs in the bone marrow, the CD117 amanitin ADC led to transient and reversible reduction of reticulocytes in the blood, likely reflecting the fact that expression of CD117 is maintained throughout the early stages of red blood cell development. 
 The CD117 amanitin ADC was well tolerated at the efficacious dose. We observed no impact on lymphocyte levels, confirming the specificity of the CD117 amanitin ADC. The ADC led to low-level, transient, reversible elevation of liver transaminases that did not result in any adverse histopathological findings in either the liver or kidney at the effective dose. 
 Our CD117 amanitin ADC with engineered fast half-life showed potent stem cell depletion and rapid clearance in non-human primates, providing appropriate pharmacokinetics for patient preparation for stem cell transplant. 
 


The timing of ADC-mediated depletion and clearance provides a window for transplant infusion. 
 
23 


 Potent and selective depletion of stem cells with rapid clearance of a non-genotoxic ADC could provide a significant improvement over current approaches to patient preparation with an acceptable safety profile prior to stem cell transplant or gene therapy, broadening patient access to these potentially curative therapies.
 Anti-tumor activity of CD117-ADC   In addition to its expressions on HSCs, CD117 is also frequently overexpressed on tumor cells in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Thus, the CD117-ADC has the potential to reduce tumor burden in patients. In data presented at the TCT conference in February 2019, we showed that CD117-ADC was effective at killing human acute myeloid leukemia cells growing in vitro. To extend these data, we also assessed the ability of CD117-ADC to reduce tumor burden and confer a survival benefit in mice bearing a human acute myeloid leukemia cell line or patient-derived acute myeloid leukemias that were resistant to multiple lines of therapy, including previous allogeneic transplant. For these studies, mice were inoculated with a lethal dose of the acute myeloid leukemia and either left untreated or treated with CD117-ADC or unconjugated CD117 antibody. Tumor-bearing mice treated with a single dose of CD117-ADC showed significantly improved survival compared to mice left untreated or those treated with unconjugated CD117 antibody. These data suggest that CD117-ADC may have utility to treat leukemias through a direct cytotoxic effect on tumors. 
 


CD117-ADC effectively depletes human leukemic cells in NSG mice. Schematic of in vivo leukemia model. The human acute myeloid leukemia cell line Kasumi-1 (left) or patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia cells (right) were injected into NSG mice to serve as a pharmacology model of established acute myeloid leukemia. A single injection of 0.3 mg/kg CD117 amanitin ADC or unconjugated anti-CD117 antibody or isotype amanitin occurred after tumors were established. Survival curves of mice after tumor injection and treatment are shown. 
 The targeted conditioning and potential for disease control offered by CD117-ADC may extend stem cell transplant to additional leukemia patients and improve outcomes. This is especially important as acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes represent areas of high medical need. Current treatment for patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes involves chemotherapy to induce disease remission followed by allogeneic stem cell transplant. However, many patients are unable to achieve disease remission using current chemotherapy agents, rendering them ineligible for allogeneic transplant. Moreover, in the approximately 35% of eligible patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome that do receive a transplant, outcomes remain suboptimal with only 50% survival five years after transplant. In addition, many patients have co-morbidities such as increased age or decreased organ function that necessitate the use of a reduced intensity of conditioning which leads to higher rates of disease relapse. Because acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes are increasingly seen in older patients, many patients are often deemed too frail to undergo a transplant, leaving them with limited treatment options. The anti-leukemia activity of CD117-ADC has the potential to reduce disease burden and improve outcomes for patients and allow relapsed/refractory patients to have access to a stem cell transplant. 
 
24 


 We have declared a development candidate in our C200 program and have moved into IND-enabling studies. We plan to file the IND for this program in 2020. 
 Clinical development plans 
Our goal is also to investigate the ability of CD117-ADC to condition patients prior to receiving HSC-based gene therapy. Gene therapy is a promising approach to treat a variety of non-malignant diseases, including inherited metabolic disorders, sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. However, the risks and toxicity associated with current chemotherapy-based conditioning approaches may limit the utility of this approach. Our targeted CD117-ADC has the potential to provide a safe and effective approach to conditioning gene therapy patients. 
 We believe CD117-ADC has the potential to increase the number of eligible patients who receive a transplant and expand the number of patients who are eligible. 
 Given the ability of CD117-ADC to deplete HSCs and leukemia cells shown in our preclinical data, we intend to pursue a development plan for patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. 
 Approximately 47,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe are diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia every year. Of those patients, about 60% achieve remission with chemotherapy agents and are eligible for transplant. However, of these, only approximately 30 to 40% actually receive a transplant. This is largely due to the toxicity risk associated with current conditioning protocols. We believe our conditioning agents would allow more patients to achieve remission and become eligible for transplant. 
 Approximately 34,300 patients in the U.S. and Europe are diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndromes every year. Of those patients, about 30% are eligible for transplant based on high risk disease. However, of these patients, only approximately 16 to 40% actually receive a transplant. This is largely due to the toxicity risk associated with current conditioning protocols. We believe our conditioning agents would allow more patients to achieve remission and become eligible for transplant. 
 C300 program 
 Our third ADC-based conditioning program, C300, targets T cells. T cell depletion is currently performed with highly toxic non-specific drugs, which can lead to immune deficiency, infections and other complications, including secondary autoimmune reactions. We are pursuing targets expressed on the surfaces of T cells with the goal of offering a safer and more optimized targeted conditioning approach through T cell depletion before CAR T therapy for blood cancers, prevention of stem cell rejection prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant or achievement of immune system reset before autologous stem cell transplant in autoimmune disease patients. 
 Stem cell mobilization program 
 Unmet need 
 Successful stem cell transplantation requires collection of HSCs in both sufficient number and quality to allow for robust engraftment, recovery of blood cells, and lifelong maintenance of the hematopoietic system. Higher cell doses are associated with better outcomes in stem cell transplant. 
 Current methods for stem cell collection include a bone marrow harvest, a procedure performed under general anesthesia, or mobilization of stem cells from the bone marrow to blood, where they are then collected through a process called apheresis. The autologous transplant field has moved away from bone marrow harvest in recent years, due to the difficulty of the procedure for both patients and physicians, and there is a need for better HSC mobilization agents for apheresis. 
 The predominant source of HSCs for adult transplant is mobilized peripheral blood that is acquired by apheresis, or collection of donor or patient blood after several days of injections of G-CSF. G-CSF mobilizes 
 
25 


  stem cells indirectly, requiring repeated daily injections, and is often associated with bone pain, nausea, headache, and fatigue. The multi-day regimen can take up to a week and side effects can be disruptive for both patients having their cells collected for autologous transplants and for healthy volunteers donating their cells for allogeneic transplants. It is difficult to predict whether mobilization will be successful, especially in heavily treated blood cancer patients. In fact, most patients require multiple apheresis sessions and some patients require more than one stem cell collection procedure to obtain a sufficient number of cells for transplant. Mobilization failure rates are as high as 35% in patients with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. For patients who are unable to mobilize sufficient numbers of stem cells with G-CSF, physicians are then required to retreat with G-CSF and add another drug, called plerixafor. Plerixafor acts as a small molecule CXCR4 antagonist, blocking a pathway that otherwise plays an essential role in attracting and retaining HSCs in the bone marrow. It is approved for use in combination with G-CSF for patients who fail to achieve sufficient mobilization of stem cells with G-CSF alone. It can mobilize stem cells as a single agent but not to sufficient levels to be used as a standalone agent. In addition, G-CSF is also contra-indicated in some patient populations, such as patients with sickle cell disease, and it can exacerbate autoimmune diseases. 
 Our solution 
 MGTA-145 is a novel first-line stem cell mobilization product candidate that was developed based on our understanding of the physiological mechanisms that control stem cell mobilization. The goal of MGTA-145 is to achieve high levels of stem cell mobilization in patients and donors in order to offer a predictable and reliable first-line mobilization agent that enables same-day apheresis, without the need to use G-CSF, the current standard of care. MGTA-145 is a CXCR2 agonist protein that activates neutrophils to release proteases that cause the release of HSCs into the blood. This novel mechanism of action is complementary to that of plerixafor. Preclinical data have shown that the synergistic combination of MGTA-145 and plerixafor leads to robust and rapid stem cell mobilization. Further, these mobilized stem cells outperform stem cells mobilized by G-CSF in mouse transplant models. 
 Mechanism of action 
 CXCR2 is a chemokine receptor expressed on the surface of neutrophils. Binding of MGTA-145 to the receptor results in neutrophil activation. Published data from Magenta founders and scientists show that a key event for mobilization of stem cells is the MGTA-145-mediated release of proteases from activated neutrophils, which together with the actions of the CXCR4 antagonist, plerixafor, results in the rapid release of HSCs from the bone marrow into the blood. Blocking CXCR4 using plerixafor and activating neutrophils with MGTA-145 together produce an effective and synergistic untethering and release of HSCs from bone marrow into the blood, resulting in rapid and robust mobilization of HSCs. 
 


The goal of MGTA-145 is to enable single-day mobilization of high numbers of HSCs. Mobilized peripheral blood stem cells are currently the predominant source of HSCs for both autologous and allogeneic 
 
26 


  transplantation. The most common clinical HSCs mobilization protocol is five days of G-CSF. This regimen requires daily injections, has been associated with bone pain and often results in unpredictably low yields. MGTA-145, in combination with plerixafor, provides a rapid mobilization method that only requires a single treatment and has robust and predictable kinetics. The stem cells mobilized with this combination contain a higher frequency of HSCs compared to those mobilized with G-CSF, which could significantly improve transplant outcomes over the current standard of care. 
 Preclinical development 
 Research from Magenta scientific collaborators from Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital published in Cell in December 2017 demonstrates that a single administration of MGTA-145, in combination with plerixafor, resulted in rapid mobilization of robust numbers of HSCs from the bone marrow and into the blood. The cells were then harvested for transplant in mouse models. Notably, HSCs mobilized with MGTA-145 and plerixafor and subsequently transplanted into mouse models resulted in faster engraftment and higher levels of donor cells, two important factors for the success of a transplant, compared to cells obtained with the current mobilization standard of care, G-CSF.



The combination of MGTA-145 and plerixafor rapidly mobilizes mouse HSCs. Blood was assessed at various time points after administration of plerixafor (5mg/kg), MGTA-145 (2.5mg/kg) or MGTA-145 plus plerixafor combination given simultaneously. Mean ± the standard error of the mean (SEM) from n = 4 BALB/c mice/group/time point. *p < 0.01 versus MGTA-145 or plerixafor ANOVA. (Ref: Hoggatt et al., 2018, Cell 172, 114). 
 In studies in non-human primates, we showed that a single administration of MGTA-145, in combination with plerixafor, induced robust mobilization of a transplantable dose of CD34+CD90+CD45RA- HSCs within four hours of administration. CD34+CD90+CD45RA- cells are highly enriched for HSCs and are important for 
 
27 


  long-term engraftment and hematopoietic reconstitution, both of which influence patient outcomes. These data were presented at the TCT conference in February 2019. 
 


A single injection of MGTA-145 + plerixafor mobilizes higher numbers of CD34+ cells compared to a multi-day regimen of G-CSF in nonhuman primates. Rhesus macaques received a single injection of plerixafor (1 mg/kg SC) alone or MGTA-145 (450 µg/kg IV) + plerixafor or five daily injections of G-CSF (50 µg/kg SC). Treatment with MGTA-145 + plerixafor leads to robust CD34+ cell mobilization that peaks at 4-6 hours post dose administration. Data represent 3-13 animals per group and are expressed as mean +/- SEM. Statistical significance was determined by Students t test. *p<0.05 for comparisons to plerixafor.   In further studies in non-human primates, MGTA-145, used in combination with plerixafor, rapidly mobilized robust numbers of stem cells compared to G-CSF. Two of two primates were successfully mobilized with this combination, while only one of two primates was successfully mobilized with G-CSF. The cells mobilized with the MGTA-145 and plerixafor combination successfully engrafted in a non-human primate model.

 Autologous transplant of MGTA-145+ plerixafor-mobilized CD34+ cells leads to rapid neutrophil recovery in non-human primates. (A) Schematic for a non-human primate model of autologous transplantation of gene-edited CD34+ cells. Rhesus macaques were mobilized with a single injection of MGTA-145 + plerixafor or 5 daily injections of G-CSF and mobilized peripheral blood was collected by leukapheresis starting at 1-2 hours post dose administration. Mobilized CD34+ cells were isolated by positive selection and gene edited in a 48-hour culture prior to autologous transplantation back into rhesus macaques following TBI. (B) Apheresis yields and (C) time to neutrophil recovery are shown for 2 non-human primates transplanted with MGTA-145 + plerixafor-mobilized CD34+ cells compared to 1 animal transplanted with G-CSF-mobilized CD34+ cells. An additional non-human primate mobilized with G-CSF had insufficient CD34+ yield and was not transplanted due to safety concerns. All animals received daily injections of G-CSF (10 µg/kg) post transplant as supportive care to treat neutropenia until neutrophil counts passed 500/µL. The second non-human primate to receive MGTA-145 + plerixafor-mobilized CD34+ cells is at day 18 post-transplant, and the non-human primate that received G-CSF-mobilized CD34+ cells is at day 37 post-transplant. 
 Further, the combination of MGTA-145 and plerixafor mobilized a high number of a CD34dim population of monocytes with immunosuppressive properties that blocked GvHD, a significant challenge in allogeneic transplant, in a preclinical model. 
 


MGTA-145 + plerixafor mobilized higher numbers of CD34dim cells compared to G-CSF or plerixafor alone.

These data were presented at the TCT conference in February 2019. 
 
29 


 Taken together, these data suggest that MGTA-145 with plerixafor offers a more robust, safer and more practical first-line therapy alternative to G-CSF for single-day mobilization and apheresis of large numbers of stem cells for use in both autologous and allogeneic transplant. 
 Clinical development plan 
 We plan to start the first clinical trial of MGTA-145 in the first half of 2019. This Phase 1 trial will study MGTA-145 plus plerixafor in healthy subjects. We plan to develop MGTA-145 for mobilization first in patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We also plan to study MGTA-145 in related and unrelated donors for allogeneic transplant; in patient populations where G-CSF can exacerbate the disease, such as autoimmune diseases; and patient populations where G-CSF is contra-indicated, such as sickle cell disease. 
 We anticipate that the market opportunity for MGTA-145 will continue to increase as the number of transplants performed increases. 
 In the U.S. and Europe, approximately 85% of stem cell transplants performed each year use mobilized peripheral blood from either donors or patients themselves as a source of stem cells. The number of patients requiring mobilization may increase as safer transplant conditioning protocols, such as the ones we are developing, increase the number of patients eligible for transplant, including patients with autoimmune or sickle cell disease. 
 Stem cell expansion program: MGTA-456 cell therapy 
 Unmet Need 
 It is critical that patients receive a sufficiently high dose of HSCs in the transplant, as higher cell doses are closely correlated to better patient outcomes. In allogeneic transplant, up to half of the approximately 23,000 patients requiring donor cells will not find a suitable donor within their families or among the registered bone marrow donors. Long search times for unrelated donors and their frequent unavailability represent a major challenge, particularly for patients with diseases that can progress rapidly, such as certain inherited metabolic diseases and high-risk acute leukemias. Because of the urgency for these patients to undergo transplant, there is a need for new options, and the ability to quickly find a well-matched stem cell donor with sufficient cells remains one of the most significant hurdles in stem cell transplant. 
Our Solution 
 MGTA-456 is an allogeneic cell therapy that is readily available and is designed to provide patients with a higher dose of HSCs that are well matched to the patient. 
Rare Genetic Diseases 
 We are currently studying MGTA-456 in a Phase 2 trial in patients with inherited metabolic disorders. These rare genetic diseases, which include Hurler syndrome, cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, or cALD; metachromatic leukodystrophy, or MLD; and globoid cell leukodystrophy, or GLD; progress rapidly and are fatal if left untreated. Stem cell transplant is the only disease-modifying treatment option for Hurler syndrome, and the only treatment option for cALD, MLD and GLD. We believe the high number of HSCs present in MGTA-456

30 


  will speed engraftment, reduce or eliminate engraftment failure and improve patient outcomes, with the potential to deliver transformative and durable disease benefit to these patients. 
 


At the TCT conference in February 2019, we reported early data from the first five patients treated in this Phase 2 study. All five patients with inherited metabolic disorders treated with MGTA-456 as of the data cut-off met the primary endpoint of successful engraftment. Patients with Hurler syndrome showed an increase in corrected enzyme and decrease in disease-related metabolites, and patients with cALD showed resolution of brain inflammation on MRI as early as one month post-treatment. These early disease markers and brain imaging evidence, respectively, are correlated with positive long-term disease outcomes. Two treatment-related adverse events were observed: one grade 1 vomiting and one grade 3 nausea, both of which were transient.

 Two patients less than two years of age with Hurler syndrome treated with MGTA-456 in the Magenta study developed autoimmune cytopenia. Autoimmune cytopenia was also observed in one of the two patients with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy in the study. This patient was successfully treated for the cytopenia and continued to show evidence of cALD disease benefit by MRI imaging as shown above. 
 These cytopenias were determined to be unrelated to MGTA-456. Autoimmune cytopenia is a known and frequent complication of the transplant procedure, particularly in younger patients with non-malignant diseases, such as inherited metabolic disorders. In light of the elevated incidence of autoimmune cytopenias in young patients and patients with Hurler syndrome, we have voluntarily focused enrollment toward pediatric patients older than two years of age diagnosed with leukodystrophies. We plan to continue enrolling patients with leukodystrophies in the study. 
 Blood Cancers 
MGTA-456 has also shown promise in patients with blood cancers, where initial, first-in-human clinical testing of MGTA-456 was performed by Novartis between 2012 and 2016 in adult (n=15) and pediatric (n=3) patients with blood cancers conditioned with a myeloablative protocol, which means near-complete elimination of stem cells in the bone marrow. The study focused on the simultaneous transplant of two cord blood units, or double cord blood transplant, where one unit was expanded using the AHR antagonist to produce MGTA-456 and the other unit was unmanipulated. MGTA-456 successfully engrafted in all 18 patients treated in a median of 14.5 days. 
 In a subsequent Phase 1/2 study conducted at the University of Minnesota beginning in 2014, nine patients underwent a myeloablative conditioning regimen before receiving MGTA-456 as a single stem cell source, and the other nine patients underwent non-myeloablative conditioning before receiving MGTA-456.
Data from this study were presented at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, annual meeting in December 2017. MGTA-456 successfully engrafted in all 18 patients, with rapid time to neutrophil engraftment and immune recovery regardless of conditioning intensity. Under the myeloablative protocol, all patients transplanted with MGTA-456 engrafted with a median time to neutrophil recovery of 14 days. None of the patients transplanted with MGTA-456 failed to engraft. Among patients conditioned with the non-myeloablative protocol, all patients treated with MGTA-456 engrafted with a median time to neutrophil recovery of eight days. There were no early 
 
33 


  engraftment failures among patients treated with MGTA-456, and no late engraftment failures in any patient treated with MGTA-456, with a patient follow-up of more than two years for all studies. This supports the view that MGTA-456 contains HSCs that retain long-term engraftment. Overall survival at two years for patients treated with MGTA-456 was 67%. 
 Sickle Cell Disease 
 We have also explored the possibility of studying MGTA-456 in patients with sickle cell disease. After careful review of comprehensive transplant outcomes data in sickle cell disease from the CIBMTR, we have concluded that the current transplant process will require optimization through targeted conditioning programs before MGTA-456 could deliver maximum clinical benefit to patients with sickle cell disease. We will continue our focus on advancing our potentially transformative conditioning and mobilization programs for patients with sickle cell disease. 
Clinical Development Plan 
 We intend to study MGTA-456 in conditions where we believe it may bring durable and transformative benefit to patients. If the results from the Phase 2 study in IMDs are favorable, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 trial in 2020 in patients with IMDs. 
 There are approximately 400 patients diagnosed with IMDs each year in the U.S. and Europe only. 
 We plan to continue to explore MGTA-456 in patients with blood cancers who could benefit from a well-matched stem cell transplant with a high dose of cells. We are in discussions with physician groups and regulatory agencies on the ideal endpoints and comparator treatments to enable clinical trial(s), which could lead to registration. We are adding to the body of data for MGTA-456 in blood cancers through an investigator-initiated Phase 2 study in blood cancers at the University of Minnesota, which was initiated in December 2018. We anticipate that this study will triple the number of patients with blood cancers undergoing myeloablative conditioning treated with MGTA-456 as a stand-alone cell source, build experience with the cryopreserved formulation of MGTA-456 and help inform the design of further Company-sponsored studies in patients with blood cancers. 
 On April 11, 2018, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for MGTA-456 for the enhancement of cell engraftment in patients receiving stem cell transplant. In addition, we expect to focus on obtaining regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation, accelerated approval for IMDs and eventually obtain a broad allogeneic cell therapy label. 
 We obtained the rights to MGTA-456 through an April 2017 license agreement with Novartis granting us the sole worldwide rights to research, develop and commercialize certain AHR antagonist compounds specifically for the expansion of cord blood-derived non-gene-edited/-modified HSCs. 
 MGTA-456 manufacturing process 
 MGTA-456 is manufactured at a GMP-certified contract manufacturing facility, which has produced all batches of MGTA-456 used for clinical trials. The manufacturing process involves selection of CD34+ cells which contain the stem cells, from an umbilical cord blood unit matched to the patient to create a CD34-enriched cell fraction and a CD34-depleted cell fraction. The CD34-depleted fraction is cryopreserved following selection and later thawed and infused at the time of transplant. The CD34-depleted fraction contains immune cells that are important for immune recovery and provide a source of donor T cells that can recognize and kill residual tumor cells in the patient when used in patients with blood cancers. The CD34+ enriched cells are cultured for 15 days with growth factors that promote cell division and the low molecular weight AHR antagonist to produce 
 
34 


  MGTA-456. While the cells are being cultured, the patient is conditioned for transplant. The MGTA-456 manufacturing process results in a median increase in the number of CD34+ cells of 327-fold (range: 67-fold to 848-fold) across all studies. 
 


Summary of clinical manufacturing of MGTA-456, CD34+ cell numbers before and after expansion in 36 clinical manufacturing batches 
 After culture, the cells are washed, characterized, and re-suspended in human serum albumin solution. The cells then undergo quality and release testing. MGTA-456 can then be infused directly into the recipient (fresh product) or can be mixed with cryopreservation medium, cryopreserved and infused to the patient after thawing. The ability to cryopreserve MGTA-456 should allow for shipment of the product globally. The manufacturing process takes a total of 15 days from receipt of the cord blood unit to product release. The shelf life of the fresh product is 24 hours after manufacturing. The shelf life of the frozen product is up to 90 days. We are currently working with third-party GMP suppliers for our clinical manufacturing process and with commercial contract manufacturing organizations to develop a process for commercial supply.

 Schematic of the MGTA-456 manufacturing process. The cord blood unit is thawed and the CD34+ cells are selected and expanded in the presence of an AHR antagonist. Following expansion, the CD34+ cells are infused followed by the CD34-depleted fraction. The HSCs migrate to the bone marrow and rebuild the blood system. 
 The manufacturing process for MGTA-456 does not require genomic manipulation. The small molecule AHR antagonist used in the MGTA-456 manufacturing process is manufactured under GMP conditions from readily available starting materials in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes that do not require specialized equipment in the manufacturing process. 
 Stem cell expansion program: E478 
 Unmet need 
 Stem cell transplant with gene-modified HSCs, which is referred to as stem cell gene therapy or genome editing, is a promising treatment approach for a number of inherited diseases but is currently limited by the inability to generate a sufficient dose of gene-modified HSCs to achieve clinically meaningful results. 
 The ability to expand HSCs ex vivo has the potential to improve outcomes with gene therapy or genome editing by increasing the dose of genetically modified stem cells. This has been a long-term goal of the field and has the potential to reduce manufacturing costs for these therapies by requiring less viral vector for gene modification of the stem cells. Scaling up vector manufacturing in a cost-effective manner has been a significant challenge for HSC-based gene therapy companies and a significant cost driver. Such cost and capacity issues could limit the commercial viability and widespread deployment of gene therapies. This will only be a bigger challenge as more gene therapies enter the marketplace in the coming years. 
 Our solution 
 We developed the E478 program in response to an unmet technological need recognized in the field of gene therapy  the challenge of achieving sufficiently high doses of transduced or gene-modified cells. We believe that E478 could represent a key component for unlocking the full value of gene therapy by providing each patient with an optimal dose of gene-modified HSCs for rapid and successful engraftment. 
 E478 uses the same clinically validated method used to produce MGTA-456, AHR antagonism, to expand HSCs. We are developing E478 specifically to partner with gene therapy and/or genome editing companies to integrate into their manufacturing processes, leading to newly defined cell therapy products. 
 To demonstrate the utility of E478 for increasing the dose of gene-modified human HSCs that retain engraftment activity, we performed a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. We have shown that E478 can generate higher numbers of long-term engrafting cells compared to other expansion technologies. We have presented in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating successful expansion of gene-modified HSCs from both bone marrow and mobilized blood and in vivo engraftment of the expanded cells modified via lentiviral transduction, CRISPR/Cas9 and other gene-modifying approaches. 
 



36 


 In data we presented at the ASH annual meeting in December 2017, we showed that in vitro culture of HSCs with E478 resulted in up to an 8-fold increase in the number of CD34+ cells, a cell population enriched for human HSCs. Transplant of cells expanded with E478 into immune-deficient mice resulted in a 10-fold increase in the number of human cells that engrafted in vivo compared to cells cultured in the absence of E478. Importantly, the high levels of editing of the expanded cells obtained during the in vitro culture (approximately 80%) were maintained in vivo, demonstrating that the expanded and edited HSCs retain engraftment activity.

 We next performed similar experiments designed to evaluate the ability of E478 to increase HSC numbers for HSC based gene therapy. In these studies, human CD34+ cells isolated from G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood were cultured with cytokines in the presence or absence of E478 and transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) to identify cells that were effectively transduced. Inclusion of E478 increased the number of CD34+ cells and improved the level of human cell engraftment while maintaining high levels of transduction.

 Development plan 
 We are conducting additional preclinical studies to examine the ability of E478 to expand HSCs transduced with lentiviral vectors. 
 We are developing E478 specifically to partner with gene therapy and/or genome editing companies to integrate into their manufacturing processes, leading to newly defined cell therapy products. 
 Post-transplant complications programs 
 Unmet need 
 Approximately 40% of all stem cell transplants are allogeneic. GvHD, a reaction that commonly develops after an allogeneic stem cell transplant, occurs when the transplanted cells see the recipients body as foreign. The grafted cells then attack their new host. It is the result of the donor T cells not matching the recipients, and this underscores the importance of HLA matching between the donor and the recipient. If they are not well matched, the donors T cells recognize the recipients cells as foreign and attack them. Recipients who receive poorly matched stem cells are among those at the highest risk of developing this condition. However, GvHD can occur even with proper HLA matching. Acute GvHD typically occurs within the first 100 days following transplant and can severely damage the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal system. It occurs in approximately 50 to 80% of patients receiving an allogenic stem cell transplant, depending on the specific indication, and accounts for approximately 10% of deaths following an allogeneic transplant. Current treatments for acute GvHD prevention include the prophylactic use of immune suppressive agents that prevent T cell activation, such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus along with mycophenolic acid, first discovered in 1893, which inhibits DNA base synthesis which is required by proliferating T cells or steroids. Despite the use of these powerful immune suppressive agents, most allogeneic transplant patients will experience GvHD. For severe cases, patients are treated with high doses of steroids, immune ablating antibodies or chemotherapy. The use of high-dose non-specific immune suppressive agents for GvHD treatment is correlated with an increased risk of opportunistic and viral infections, poor immune function and is a leading cause of death in allogenic transplant patients. 
 Our solution 
 We are developing a unique approach to preventing acute GvHD. Our ADC-based therapeutics are designed to selectively eliminate only the components of the graft that cause acute GvHD, specifically the alloreactive T cells. This ADC therapy is intended to be dosed in vivo at the time of transplant and eliminate the activated alloreactive T cells. By specifically targeting the alloreactive T cells that arise shortly after transplant, this therapy should spare the remainder of the immune system to allow immune recovery and protection from opportunistic infections. 
 Commercialization Plan 
 We plan to establish sales, marketing, and commercial product distribution capabilities. Ahead of our first commercial launch, we are building upon relationships with transplant centers and thought leaders, furthering our understanding of the influences on the transplant decision-making process, refining our market research into reimbursement and market access, and leveraging our partnership with the National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match, or NMDP/BTM. Transplants are currently conducted in a small number of specialist sites in the U.S. and Europe. There are approximately 170 transplant centers in the U.S. that are accredited through the NMDP, of which 20% of these transplant centers collectively account for over 50% of transplant volume. In Europe, approximately 205 transplant centers are accredited through the Joint Accreditation Committee ISCT-Europe-EMBT and data suggest that 30% of transplants in Europe between 2012 and 2015 were carried out by 20 centers in France and Spain. All of our product candidates are focused on the transplant physician as the key prescriber and decision maker. 
 
38 


 As we advance our development programs in the U.S. and Europe, we will evaluate our sales and marketing resource needs. In advance of approval of our first product in the U.S. and Europe, we plan to build out a dedicated transplant-center-focused sales and marketing organization. We intend to leverage the infrastructure developed for MGTA-456 and MGTA-145 to support commercialization of any additional product candidates in our portfolio for which we gain approval. In addition, we will build upon physicians familiarity with MGTA-456 and MGTA-145 to accelerate adoption of our other stem cell transplant medicines. As additional product candidates advance through our pipeline, our commercial plans may change. In particular, some of our pipeline assets target autoimmune disease indications, which could potentially require commercial reach that captures referring physicians outside of transplant centers and clinical trial sites. 
 Our commercial strategy may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sales force or the establishment of our own commercial structure. 
 Stem cell Transplant Market Opportunity 
 Despite the risks associated with stem cell transplant, today it is a large market opportunity with approximately 65,000 procedures performed annually. However, this number represents only 40% of the patient population that is eligible for transplant. 
 At Magenta, we believe our portfolio of product candidates could not only address deficiencies in existing approaches but also extend the curative power of stem cell transplant to more patients. Each of our product candidates contributes uniquely to addressing certain unmet needs in stem cell transplant. By using multiple Magenta products, physicians would be able to tailor the transplant procedure, thereby improving patient outcomes and increasing the potential for every eligible patient to benefit from a stem cell transplant. 
 Across diseases where transplant has been shown to result in improved patient outcomes, only a small fraction of eligible patients currently receive a transplant because the risks and challenges outweigh the potential for a cure. Depending on the disease, the barriers for treatment include finding a matched donor, obtaining an adequate cell dose and the morbidity and mortality associated with current conditioning regimens. We believe that by removing the major barriers to transplant with Magentas programs, we enable transplant for all of the approximately 150,000 eligible patients. Further, by making the procedure less risky and toxic, we believe the eligible patient populations could significantly increase beyond the current numbers. This includes patients with autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, where the current risk-benefit of transplant is not considered favorable due to the toxicity of the existing conditioning regimens. 
 


Not To Scale 
 
39 


 At Magenta, we are planning to develop our suite of medicines for stem cell transplant across several indications. These include diseases where stem cell transplant is currently a standard of care (e.g., blood cancers such as acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), diseases where transplant is performed but limited in use (e.g., hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia), and diseases where the clinical promise for stem cell transplant is emerging (e.g., autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis and multiple sclerosis). The introduction of innovative medicines to the marketplace that address some of the barriers for treatment with transplant would therefore potentially enable each eligible patient across these diseases to receive a transplant, and managements growth rate assumptions, we estimate that the total number of transplants performed in these indications will be approximately 150,000 by 2028 across the U.S. and Europe. Based on this projected growth in transplant volume for these diseases, we further assessed the addressable patient population on a per program basis to estimate the potential number of treatments that could be provided on a per patient basis. This analysis, summarized in the table below, assumes demonstration of clinical outcomes that address barriers to treatment with transplant. 
 Of the approximately 150,000 estimated stem cell transplant patients in the U.S. and Europe only in approximately 10 years, each will potentially need multiple treatments using products to be developed under our programs: 
 


Autoimmune diseases: emerging data support use of stem cell transplant as a clinically promising one-time therapy, however the high morbidity and mortality associated with current conditioning regimens limit the uptake of transplant as a therapeutic option. 
 Multiple sclerosis affects approximately 600,000 to 700,000 patients in the U.S. and historically at least 650,000 patients in Europe. Approximately 15,000 new patients in the U.S. and 32,000 new patients in Europe are diagnosed annually. To assess eligibility in this population we focused on the patients with active relapsing-remitting disease and relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patients who are not adequately treated by current therapies. This population represents approximately 45,000 multiple sclerosis patients who switch therapies each year in the U.S. and we believe that a greater population of patients switch therapies each year in Europe. Many of these patients switch because their current therapy does not adequately control disease activity 
 
40 


  such as relapses. Given stem cell transplants ability to durably eliminate relapses and disease activity in multiple sclerosis patients, we believe a safer transplant procedure would be a viable option for those patients with highly active disease beyond what therapeutics can manage. Currently approximately 1 to 2% of eligible multiple sclerosis patients in the U.S. and Europe receive a stem cell transplant because the risk of the process outweighs the benefits of a potential cure and we believe we can significantly expand this number. 
 Scleroderma, a chronic connective tissue disease that is characterized by thickening of the skin, is diagnosed in approximately 6,600 patients in the U.S. and 10,900 patients in Europe annually. Approximately 35% (2,300 patients in the U.S., 3,800 patients in Europe) of scleroderma patients suffer from diffuse cutaneous disease and are therefore eligible for stem cell transplant. Currently approximately 1% or less of eligible scleroderma patients in the U.S. and Europe receive a stem cell transplant. However, with the addition of stem cell transplant into the EULAR, treatment guidelines for scleroderma and with the opportunity for a safer transplant procedure, we believe transplant would be a viable option for the severe scleroderma patient population who have no other therapeutic options available. 
 Our conditioning programs, such as C100 or a combination of C200 and C300, have the potential to provide safer, targeted conditioning for these autoimmune disease patients receiving autologous transplant. We are developing these targeted conditioning approaches to grow the use of transplant in autoimmune disease significantly. In addition, our MGTA-145 product candidate may address the difficult-to-mobilize patients who cannot receive G-CSF because of the risk of triggering autoimmune flares. 
 Blood Cancers: Stem cell transplant is a standard of care, however a significant number of eligible patients do not receive a transplant because of lack of a matched donor, poor mobilization, and the toxicity of conditioning: 
 Acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, a cancer arising from myeloid cells, an immature white blood cell found in the bone marrow, is diagnosed in approximately 20,000 patients in the U.S. and 27,000 patients in Europe annually. Approximately 60% (12,500 patients in the U.S., 16,400 patients in Europe) of newly diagnosed patients have a complete response to induction chemotherapy and become eligible for transplant for a more durable remission. However, the current challenges of stem cell transplant and patient co-morbidities limit transplant to approximately 30 to 40% of those patients who are otherwise eligible. 
 Myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, occurs when the blood-forming cells in the bone marrow become abnormal, leading to low numbers of one or more types of blood cells. It is diagnosed in approximately 21,000 patients in the U.S. and 13,300 patients in Europe annually. Approximately 30% (6,700 patients in the U.S., 4,600 patients in Europe) of newly diagnosed patients have high risk disease and are eligible for stem cell transplant. However, toxicities of stem cell transplant and patient co-morbidities limit transplant to approximately 16 to 40% of those patients who are otherwise eligible. 
 Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL, a cancer arising from lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, is diagnosed in approximately 72,000 patients in the U.S. and 95,000 patients in Europe annually. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the most common blood cancer, can be treated by autologous stem cell transplant. The largest Non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype is Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, or DLBCL, comprising approximately 33% of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. First-line chemotherapy and targeted therapies like rituximab are effective for about two-thirds of DLBCL patients. In the remaining one-third of patients with relapsed/refractory disease, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends autologous stem cell transplant as one therapeutic option. Therefore, approximately 6,500 newly diagnosed patients in the U.S. and 8,500 patients in Europe are eligible for stem cell transplant. Currently, approximately 60 to 80% of those eligible Non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients in the U.S. and Europe receive a stem cell transplant. 
 
41 


 Multiple myeloma, or MM, a cancer arising from plasma cells, is diagnosed in approximately 30,000 patients in the U.S. and 40,000 patients in Europe annually. Multiple myeloma represents the second most common blood cancer treated by autologous stem cell transplant. Approximately 50% (15,000 patients in the U.S., 20,000 patients in Europe) of newly diagnosed patients are eligible for stem cell transplant. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends stem cell transplant for patients after primary therapeutic treatment, including novel orals, injectables, and chemotherapy. This recommendation is founded on evidence that autologous stem cell transplant consistently achieves higher response rates and survival rates than primary treatment alone. However, toxicities of stem cell transplant and patient co-morbidities limit transplant to approximately 55 to 60% of those patients who are otherwise eligible. 
 Our conditioning programs, such as C100 and C200, have the potential to provide safer, targeted conditioning for these blood cancer patients who are too frail to tolerate the current conditioning regimens. Our MGTA-145 product candidate has the potential to address the difficult-to-mobilize patients who are suffering from blood cancers as well so that patients can access a robust single-day mobilization regimen. For allogeneic transplant recipients, MGTA-456 offers access to a well-matched cell therapy, with a high stem cell dose and the higher likelihood of durable clinical outcomes. 
 Hemoglobinopathies: Stem cell transplant is clinically accepted but still limited in use due to challenges identifying well-matched donors and conditioning-associated morbidity and mortality. Gene therapy is a promising treatment option but is limited by the same conditioning challenges as well as the ability to obtain a sufficient dose of gene-modified cells. 
 Sickle cell disease, or SCD, is diagnosed in approximately 1,700 patients in the U.S. and 720 patients in Europe annually. Approximately 25% (400 patients in the U.S., 180 patients in Europe) of patients with sickle cell disease have severe disease and are therefore eligible for stem cell transplant. Currently, only approximately 36 to 58% of eligible patients with sickle cell disease in the U.S. and Europe receive a stem cell transplant because it is particularly difficult to find a matched donor and the risk of the procedure often outweighs the benefits of a potential cure. 
 Beta-thalassemia is diagnosed in approximately 500 patients in the U.S. and 1,500 patients in Europe annually. Approximately 60% (340 patients in the U.S., 1,020 patients in Europe) of patients with beta-thalassemia patients have severe disease, or beta-thalassemia major, and are therefore eligible for stem cell transplant. Currently, only approximately 27% of eligible beta-thalassemia patients in the U.S. and Europe receive a stem cell transplant because they are unable to find a matched donor and/or the risk of the process outweighs the benefits of a potential cure. 
 Our conditioning programs, such as C200, have the potential to provide safer, targeted conditioning for these hemoglobinopathy patients receiving autologous gene therapy or an allogeneic transplant. Our MGTA-145 product candidate has the potential to address patients with sickle cell disease who cannot receive G-CSF because of the risk of triggering sickle cell crises. E478 uses the same clinically-validated mechanism as MGTA-456 to generate higher doses of gene-modified stem cells. 
 Our portfolio of products is designed to address several unmet needs in transplant, providing the potential opportunity for our products to be used in combination to create disease-tailored solutions for patients. Based on the projected growth in transplant volume of approximately 150,000 transplants for the U.S. and Europe above, and management assumptions, we estimate that, by 2028 the approximately 150,000 stem cell transplant patients could be treated by around 355,000 aggregate treatments per year. This estimate includes approximately 150,000 treatments under our conditioning programs, 130,000 treatments under our mobilization program, 15,000 treatments under our expansion programs, and 60,000 treatments under our post-transplant complications program, each on an annual basis. Therefore, in 2028 an estimated 1.8 products could be used on a per patient basis annually.

 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for all of our requirements of raw materials, drug substance and drug product for our preclinical research and our ongoing clinical trial of MGTA-456. We have not entered into long-term agreements with our current CMOs. We intend to continue to rely on CMOs for later-stage development and commercialization of MGTA-456, as well as the development and commercialization of any other product candidates that we may identify. Although we rely on CMOs, we have personnel and consultants with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our contract manufacturers. 
 We believe the synthesis of the AHR antagonist that we use to manufacture MGTA-456 is reliable and reproducible from readily available starting materials, and the synthetic routes are amenable to large-scale production and do not require unusual equipment or handling in the manufacturing process. We acquired data from Novartis related to the chemical synthesis of the AHR antagonist, which has been manufactured by Novartis to satisfy our immediate and near term clinical and preclinical needs. We also acquired data from Novartis related to manufacturing of MGTA-456, which is currently manufactured by a single CMO to satisfy our immediate and near term clinical and pre-commercial needs. Drug product formulation optimization work for MGTA-456 is also in progress with this CMO. We have begun to engage with a second drug product manufacturer for our commercial supply needs for MGTA-456.
Our manufacturing strategy enables us to more efficiently direct financial resources to the research, development, and commercialization of product candidates rather than diverting resources to internally develop manufacturing facilities. As our product candidates advance through development and commercialization, we expect to enter into longer-term commercial supply agreements with key suppliers and manufacturers to fulfill and secure the ongoing and planned preclinical, clinical, and, if our product candidates are approved for marketing, commercial supply needs for ourselves and our collaborators. 
 Manufacturing of any product candidate is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. We expect that all of our CMOs will manufacture MGTA-456 under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, conditions. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals to be used in humans. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology industry is extremely competitive in the race to develop new products and treatment modalities. While we believe we have significant competitive advantages with our industry-leading expertise in transplant medicine, preclinical and clinical development expertise, our comprehensive approach to patient care and intellectual property position, we may face competition for our development programs from companies focused on traditional therapeutic modalities, such as small molecules and antibodies, as well as companies developing next-generation cell therapies. Competition is likely to come from multiple sources, including larger pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and academia. For any products that we may ultimately commercialize, not only will we compete with any existing therapies and those therapies currently in development, we will have to compete with new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe we are the only company that is committed to addressing all of the major limitations and challenges of stem cell transplant to revolutionize an entire field of medicine. We are building a comprehensive portfolio of novel therapeutic development programs to address all major unmet medical needs inherent to the existing stem cell transplant process, which distinguishes us from our competition. 
 Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and product marketing than

  we currently do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.

 Licenses and Collaborations 
 Alliance with Novartis 
 In April 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd., or Novartis, pursuant to which Novartis granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to research, develop and commercialize certain licensed products that contain Novartis compounds for the expansion of cord blood derived non-Gene-Edited/-Modified HSCs. We refer to this agreement as the Novartis Agreement. The license granted to us under the Novartis Agreement is subject to certain rights retained by Novartis for internal research purposes and certain third parties for research and educational purposes. Certain of the rights licensed to us under the Novartis Agreement are also subject to any retained rights of the U.S. government in the licensed patents. The Novartis Agreement led to the establishment of MGTA-456 as one of our programs. Under the terms of the Novartis Agreement, we are responsible for all research, development, regulatory and commercialization activities related to licensed products. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products in the U.S., United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Japan. 
 Pursuant to the Novartis Agreement, we issued to Novartis 2,500,000 shares of Series A preferred stock and 643,550 shares of Series B preferred stock. We will be required to make milestone payments to Novartis upon dosing the first patient in BLA-enabling clinical trials and upon regulatory approvals of licensed products across ultra-orphan, hemoglobinopathies and other indications. For ultra-orphan indications, we may be required to pay development and regulatory milestones of up to $13.0 million for each of the first two indications, and up to $5.0 million for a third indication. For hemoglobinopathies, we may be required to pay development and regulatory milestones of up to $13.0 million per indication, for the first two indications. For all other indications that are not an ultra-orphan or hemoglobinopathy, we may be required to pay development and regulatory milestones of up to $75.0 million for the first indication and up to $45.0 million for the second indication. Across all licensed products, we may be required to pay Novartis up to $125.0 million in sales milestones, based on the first achievement of certain aggregate worldwide annual net sales thresholds. We are also required to pay tiered royalties to Novartis on worldwide net sales of licensed products by us, ranging from low single-digit percentages to up to 20% for higher net sales, which royalties are potentially subject to reduction and offset during the royalty term. Royalties are payable on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the later of (i) expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent right that covers the manufacture, use or sale of such licensed product, or the licensed compound used in the manufacture of such licensed product, in such country and (ii) ten years following the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. 
 Novartis controls the filing, prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the licensed patent rights at its expense. We have the right to assume these responsibilities should Novartis not wish to pursue them. We own all rights in any intellectual property related to the licensed compound or licensed products that we solely develop under the Novartis Agreement. The Novartis Agreement does not otherwise allocate ownership of improvements developed thereunder; however, Novartis grants us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to practice any improvements that Novartis owns under the Novartis Agreement in connection with non-gene-edited/-modified HSCs, and we grant a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to Novartis to practice any improvements that we own under the agreement outside of such field. 
 The Novartis Agreement will continue until the last-to-expire royalty term for a licensed product unless terminated earlier by either party. Each party may terminate the Novartis Agreement due to the other partys insolvency or uncured breach of a material obligation. We have the right to terminate the Novartis Agreement in its entirety or on a product-by-product or country-by-country basis for convenience upon 90 days prior written notice to Novartis. Upon termination of the Novartis Agreement by us for convenience or by Novartis for cause, the license granted to us by Novartis will terminate and we will grant a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive license to Novartis to develop and commercialize the licensed products under any intellectual property that we (i) control and used in the development, manufacture or commercialization of licensed products or (ii) developed under the agreement to develop and commercialize the licensed products.

 Collaboration with Be The Match BioTherapies 
 In November 2017, we formalized a collaboration agreement with Be The Match BioTherapies, or BTMB, which we refer to as the BTMB Agreement, to advance our relationship developed under a Memorandum of Understanding executed in April 2017. Pursuant to the BTMB Agreement, BTMB grants us priority access to subject matter experts at the National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match, or NMDP/BTM, the CIBMTR, which is an affiliation between the Medical College of Wisconsin and NMDP/BTM, and BTMB for consultation on our clinical development and commercialization needs. The parties may enter into additional riders to the BTMB Agreement from time to time to expand the services that BTMB provides thereunder. 
 We believe that, through this priority access, the partnership enables us to establish relationships across transplant centers and with transplant physicians, giving us access to clinical strategy and development operational support, and potentially supporting our eventual commercialization efforts across several programs. 
 Under the BMTB Agreement, we will make quarterly payments to BTMB of $25,000. The term of the BTMB Agreement will continue until December 31, 2020 unless terminated earlier by either party. Either party may terminate the BTMB Agreement in whole or in part (i) for convenience upon 60 days notice, (ii) for the other partys uncured material breach upon ten days notice or (iii) upon the other partys insolvency. 
 


Harvard University License Agreement 
 In November 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Harvard University, or Harvard, pursuant to which Harvard granted us the worldwide exclusive, subject to Harvards retained right solely for research and educational purposes, sublicensable, right, to research, develop and commercialize licensed products under certain conditioning-related and mobilization-related patents. The license granted to us under the Harvard Agreement is also subject to any retained rights of the U.S. government in the licensed patents. Under the terms of the agreement, which we refer to as the Harvard Agreement, we will be responsible for all research, development, regulatory and commercialization activities related to licensed products. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize at least two licensed products under the Harvard Agreement, including one for conditioning and one for mobilization. The license from the Harvard Agreement relates to our C100, C200 and mobilization programs. 
 
46 


 Pursuant to the Harvard Agreement, we made an upfront payment to Harvard of $85,000 and issued to Harvard and the other co-owners of the licensed patent rights (The General Hospital Corporation d/b/a Massachusetts General Hospital, and Childrens Medical Center Corporation) 385,063 shares of our common stock. In addition, we reimbursed Harvard for approximately $300,000 in expenses incurred by Harvard in connection with the licensed patent rights. Harvard is also entitled to receive an annual license maintenance fee of $25,000 for each calendar year through 2019 and $50,000 for each calendar year thereafter until expiration or termination of the Harvard Agreement. 
 Harvard is entitled to payments upon certain development and regulatory milestones for the first two licensed products of up to $7.4 million per licensed product. In addition, we must pay Harvard low-single digit royalties on net sales of licensed products. If we or our affiliates or sublicensees under the Harvard Agreement commence a legal action to challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of any licensed patents, the royalty rate payable to Harvard will double during the pendency of such proceeding and will remain double thereafter if such action is determined in Harvards favor. Depending on the type of licensed product, royalties are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of (i) the last to expire valid claim in the applicable country covering or claiming the composition, manufacture, sale or use of such licensed product and (ii) 12 years from the date of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. 
 Harvard controls the filing, prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights at our expense. We have the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce licensed patent rights against third-party infringement. 
 The term of the Harvard Agreement will continue until the later of (i) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim under a licensed patent, and (ii) the expiration of the last royalty period Each party has the right to terminate the Harvard Agreement due to the other partys uncured material breach or insolvency. In particular, Harvard may terminate the Harvard Agreement upon our uncured failure to meet certain development and regulatory milestone deadlines set forth therein. We have the right to terminate the Harvard Agreement for convenience upon 60 days prior written notice to Harvard. Upon termination of the Harvard Agreement for any reason, the license granted to us by Harvard will terminate. 
 Research, Development Option and License Agreement with Heidelberg Pharma Research GmbH 
 In March 2018, we entered into an exclusive research, development option and license agreement with Heidelberg Pharma Research GmbH, or Heidelberg Pharma. We refer to this agreement as the Heidelberg Agreement. Heidelberg Pharma has developed a proprietary antibody targeted amanitin conjugates platform. This collaboration enables our research and development efforts across several targeted conditioning programs through the combination of our proprietary antibodies and Heidelberg Pharmas antibody targeted amanitin conjugates platform. 
 Under the terms of the Heidelberg Agreement, Heidelberg Pharma has granted to us a worldwide, non-exclusive research license for a one-year period with respect to certain targets set forth in an agreed-to research plan. We have the option to extend such license for up to an additional three years. In December 2018, we exercised this option to extend such license for one year. We also have an option to obtain an exclusive target-specific research license, which would expire two years after the exercise of such option. We have exercised this option for two initial targets with signature of the Heidelberg Agreement. In addition, we will have an option to obtain a target-specific exclusive license for global development and commercialization rights to each of the product candidates resulting from the research collaboration. We may obtain such exclusive target-specific rights to up to four targets. In October 2018, we exercised one of the target-specific development options. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform our research activities under the Heidelberg Agreement and, if we exercise our right to obtain a development and commercialization license, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue development and commercialization of a product directed to the applicable target. 
 
47 


 Under the terms of the Heidelberg Agreement, we granted Heidelberg Pharma a worldwide, non-exclusive license under all of our patents and know-how, and any improvements of the foregoing developed under the Heidelberg Agreement, that are reasonably necessary or useful for Heidelberg Pharma to perform its research activities under the Heidelberg Agreement. In addition, we grant Heidelberg Pharma a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license under all joint improvements developed under the Heidelberg Agreement for non-clinical research purposes only. 
 Payment terms to Heidelberg Pharma include an upfront technology access fee, research exclusivity fees with respect to the two initial targets, and payments for research support. Heidelberg Pharma is entitled to additional fees of between $50,000 and $1.1 million in the aggregate if we extend the initial research license or if we exercise our research exclusivity options with respect to additional targets. Upon our exercise of an option for an exclusive development and commercialization license, with respect to a target, we are required to make a low single digit million-dollar payment to Heidelberg Pharma for each exercised option. In addition, on a per target basis, we may be required to pay development, regulatory and commercial milestones totaling up to approximately $83.5 million per target. We will pay Heidelberg Pharma mid-single digit royalties on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, on worldwide net product sales of licensed products. Royalties are payable on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the later of (i) expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent right that covers the use, import, offering for sale, or sale of such licensed product in such country, and (ii) ten years following the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. We have the option to buy-down royalties at certain points during the development path of each product. 
 Heidelberg Pharma will own all improvements solely related to the intellectual property rights Heidelberg Pharma licensed to us under the Heidelberg Agreement. We will own all improvements solely related to the intellectual property rights that we licensed to Heidelberg Pharma and all other intellectual property rights developed under the Heidelberg Agreement for which ownership is not otherwise allocated. 
 Heidelberg Pharma controls the filing, prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the intellectual property that it licenses to us under the Heidelberg Agreement. We have the right to enforce such licensed intellectual property against infringement if the infringement is competitive with our licensed products and Heidelberg Pharma does not pursue enforcement. We control the filing, prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the intellectual property we license to Heidelberg Pharma under the Heidelberg Agreement. 
 The term of the Heidelberg Agreement will continue until the last to expire royalty term unless terminated earlier by either party. Each party has the right to terminate the Heidelberg Pharma Agreement due to the other partys uncured material breach or insolvency on a product-by-product or target-by-target basis. We have the right to terminate the Heidelberg Agreement for convenience in its entirety or on a product-by-product, target-by-target or country-by-country basis upon 60 days prior written notice to Heidelberg Pharma if terminating before the first commercial sale of a product in a country or upon six months prior written notice to Heidelberg Pharma if terminating after the first commercial sale of any product directed to such target in such country. 
 Upon termination of the Heidelberg Agreement in its entirety or with respect to a product or target, all applicable licenses granted to us will terminate immediately. 
 Bachem Master Development and Manufacturing Agreement 
 In February 2018, we entered into a Master Development and Manufacturing Agreement with Bachem Americas, Inc., or Bachem. This agreement, which we refer to as the Bachem Agreement, governs several projects related to the development and manufacture of CXCR2 agonists, including MGTA-145, each pursuant to a separate project plan. The active pharmaceutical ingredient of MGTA-145 is a 69 amino acid protein. We selected Bachem as our contract manufacturer for this program based on their deep expertise in the synthesis and 
 
48 


  production of proteins. Financial terms related to this agreement will be determined on a project-by-project basis. In April 2018, we entered into an initial one-year project plan pursuant to which Bachem will be responsible for producing batches of MGTA-145 for GLP toxicology studies completed in 2018, as well as GMP material for the Phase 1 study of MGTA-145, which is expected to commence in the first half of 2019. 
 The term of the Bachem Agreement is initially five years and will be automatically renewed for one-year periods unless either party provides the other with written notice of nonrenewal at least three months prior to expiry. Each party may terminate the agreement upon a material uncured breach of the other party. During the term, Bachem will be restricted from producing a pre-defined set of agonists, including MGTA-145, for clinical or commercial use by any third party without our prior written consent, as long as Bachem remains our primary supplier of CXCR2 agonists. Each project plan may be terminated independently of the agreement as a whole. 
 Clinical Trial Agreement with University of Minnesota 
 In January 2018, we entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement with the Regents of the University of Minnesota, or UMinn, pursuant to which UMinn will undertake a Phase 2 clinical trial with MGTA-456 for the treatment of inherited metabolic diseases. Under this agreement, UMinn is also responsible for the manufacture and supply of the required quantities of MGTA-456 for the trial, subject to specified quality assurance provisions. 
 The term of the agreement will run through the course of the trial, unless earlier terminated. Each party may terminate the agreement immediately upon the other partys material failure to follow the specified protocol for the trial or upon a material uncured breach by the other party.

 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we have filed, including the U.S., the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., a patents term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted for a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, subject to certain limitations and provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. Any such patent term extension can be for no more than five years, only one patent per approved product can be extended, the extension cannot extend the total patent term beyond 14 years from approval, and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. We may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents we may obtain in the future covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each product and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents. 
 
51 


 As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our owned and licensed pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting the protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide. For more information, see the section entitled Risk FactorsRisks Related to Intellectual Property. 
 Other IP Rights 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with our collaborators and scientific advisors, and non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We have also executed agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee, however, that we have executed such agreements with all applicable counterparties, such agreements will not be breached, or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights. For more information, see the section entitled Risk FactorsRisks Related to Intellectual Property. 
Trademarks 
 We have filed and obtained trademark protection for the MAGENTA THERAPEUTICS character mark and service mark logo for pharmaceutical research and development services and biochemical research and development services. We have also filed for trademark protection for the #THECOLOROFCURE character mark for promoting public awareness of medical disorders and their treatment, promoting public awareness of bone marrow diseases, cancer, tumors, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and related diseases and disorders, providing a website featuring medical information, and providing medical information. We plan to register trademarks in connection with our future products. 
Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products, such as MGTA-456 and any future product candidates. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 
 U.S. drug development 
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations and biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their 
 
52 


  implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 MGTA-456 and any future product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either a New Drug Application, or NDA, or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an application for an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;
--+----------------------------------------


 | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the filing for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing processes, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologics identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the U.S.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for MGTA-456 and any future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. 
 Preclinical studies and IND 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and, in some cases, to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. 
 An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the 
 
53 


  FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Clinical trials 
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsors control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the U.S. may, but often need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. 
 Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap. 
 

 | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the product candidates safety and effectiveness for its intended use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. 
 
54 


 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies, animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies, must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life. 
 NDA/BLA and FDA review process 
 Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. The NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity and potency for a biologic. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a products use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDAs fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2019, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA or BLA, is $2,588,478. The sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to an annual prescription drug program fee, which for fiscal year 2019 is $309,915. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA generally makes a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the filing date to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity 
 
55 


  NDA or original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 
 Orphan drug designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. 
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, provision of a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitors product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an 
 
56 


  orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits. 
 Expedited development and review programs 
 The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the that FDA designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA or BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. 
 A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. 
 Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. 
 Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Pediatric information 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, certain NDAs and BLAs and certain supplements to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, 
 
57 


  age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. 
 Post-marketing requirements 
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations, or off-label use, and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including recall. 
 Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics 
 We believe that the success of our product candidates may depend, in part, on the development and commercialization of either a companion diagnostic or complementary diagnostic. Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA and, as such, require either clearance or 
 
58 


  approval prior to commercialization. The level of risk combined with available controls to mitigate risk determines whether a companion diagnostic device requires Premarket Approval Application, or PMA, approval or is cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process. For a novel therapeutic product for which a companion diagnostic device is essential for the safe and effective use of the product, the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or 510(k)-cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic. The use of the companion diagnostic device will be stipulated in the labeling of the therapeutic product. This is also true for a complementary diagnostic, although it is not a prerequisite for receiving the therapeutic. 
 Other regulatory matters 
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the U.S. in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. 
 Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the U.S., these laws include: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. 
 The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. 
 The federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $11,181 and $22,363 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and the potential implication of various federal criminal statutes. The government may deem manufacturers to have caused the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, as well as the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law. 
 HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters, and, as amended by the Health Information 
 
59 


  Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms and technical safeguards, with respect to maintaining the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions; 
 The Physician Payments Sunshine Act of 2010, which requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs (those paid for by a federal healthcare program) to report to CMS any payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. 
 Analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services. Such laws are generally broad and are enforced by various state agencies and private actions. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance and require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a companys attention away from the business. 
 Current and Future Legislation 
 In the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any collaborators, may receive for any approved products. 
 With the new administration and Congress, there will likely be additional administrative or legislative changes, including modification, repeal, or replacement of all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which may impact reimbursement for drugs and biologics. For example, in Congress, the U.S. House of Representatives passed ACA replacement legislation known as the American Health Care Act of 2017 in May 2017, which was not introduced in the Senate. However, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, includes 
 
60 


  a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The current administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the Texas District Court Judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace certain elements of the ACA. In addition, since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Further, the Trump administration has concluded that cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments to insurance companies required under the ACA have not received necessary appropriations from Congress and announced that it will discontinue these payments immediately until such appropriations are made. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the ACA. A bipartisan bill to appropriate funds for CSR payments was introduced in the Senate, but the future of that bill is uncertain. Several state attorneys general filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group market places, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. 
 Packaging and Distribution in the U.S. 
 If our products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our managements attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
 Other U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations 
 We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials 
 
61 


  and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. 
 We maintain workers compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us. 
 In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. 
 U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of MGTA-456 and any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the products approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

 An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, as part of the ACA. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products as compared to small molecule drugs, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 A reference biological product is granted four- and twelve-year exclusivity periods from the time of first licensure of the product. The FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and the FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. First licensure typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the U.S. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the first licensure of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a trial. 
 European Union drug development 
 In the European Union, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the U.S., medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. 
 Similar to the U.S., the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the 
 
63 


  current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. 
 The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No. 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical. 
 European Union drug marketing 
 Much like the Anti-Kickback Statue prohibition in the U.S., the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States, such as the UK Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. 
 Payments made to physicians in certain European Union Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physicians employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual European Union Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the European Union Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment. 
 European Union drug review and approval 
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union (including Norway and excluding Croatia), Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations. 
 

 | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
64 


 
potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 European Union new chemical entity exclusivity 
 In the European Union, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovators data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovators data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. 
 European Union orphan designation and exclusivity 
 In the European Union, the EMAs Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). 
 In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 European Data Collection 
 The collection and use of personal health data in the European Union is governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, and as of May 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. This directive imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive and GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive, the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduces new data protection requirements in the European Union and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. Notably, on January 21, 2019, Google was fined almost $57 million by French regulators for violating GDPR. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

 Rest of the world regulation 
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the U.S., such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Additional laws and regulations governing international operations 
 If we further expand our operations outside of the U.S., we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 
 Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions. 
 Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the U.S., or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the U.S., it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the U.S., which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs. 
 The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPAs accounting provisions. 
 Reimbursement 
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. 
 The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including 
 
66 


  price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that subject biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars and may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs. 
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturers outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for line extensions (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, creating a new methodology by which rebates owed are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. 
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. 
 For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of childrens hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. 
 As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. 
 
67 


  An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 In recent years, additional laws have resulted in direct or indirect reimbursement reductions for certain Medicare providers. 
 

 | The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislations automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reduce the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule by 2% in 2013, which served as a base for 2014 and subsequent years. In addition, effective January 1, 2014, CMS also began bundling the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the current administration released a Blueprint, or plan, to reduce the cost of drugs. The Trump administrations Blueprint contains certain measures that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is already working to implement. For example, on October 25, 2018, CMS issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or ANPRM, indicating it is considering issuing a proposed rule in the spring of 2019 on a model called the International Pricing Index, or IPI. This model would utilize a basket of other countries prices as a reference for the Medicare program to use in reimbursing for drugs covered under Part B. The ANPRM also included an updated version of the Competitive Acquisition Program as an alternative to current buy and bill payment methods for Part B drugs. Individual state legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing. Some of these measures include price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. 
 These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. 
 In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states 
 
68 


  and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of any of our product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels or if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, our revenues from sales by us or our strategic partners and the potential profitability of any of our product candidates in those countries would be negatively affected.
