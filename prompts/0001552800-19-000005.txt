 Overview
 ﻿
 The Tile Shop, LLC (“The Tile Shop”) was founded in 1985 and Tile Shop Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings,” and together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, including The Tile Shop, the “Company” or “we”) was incorporated in Delaware in June 2012. We are a specialty retailer of natural stone and man-made tiles, setting and maintenance materials, and related accessories in the United States. Our assortment includes approximately 6,000 products from around the world. Natural stone products include marble, travertine, granite, quartz, sandstone, slate, and onyx tiles. Man-made products include ceramic, porcelain, glass, cement, wood look, and metal tiles. The majority of our tile products are sold under our proprietary Rush River and Fired Earth brand names. We purchase our tile products, accessories and tools directly from our global network of suppliers. We manufacture our own setting and maintenance materials, such as thinset, grout and sealer under our Superior brand name, as well as work with other suppliers to manufacture private label products. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 140 stores in 31 states and the District of Columbia, with an average size of approximately 20,200 square feet. 
 ﻿
 We believe that our long-term vendor relationships, together with our design, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, enable us to offer a broad assortment of high-quality products to our customers, who are primarily homeowners and professionals, at competitive prices. We have invested significant resources to develop our proprietary brands and product sources and believe that we are a leading retailer of natural stone and man-made tiles, setting and maintenance materials, and related accessories in the United States.
 ﻿
 In 2018, we reported net sales and income from operations of $357.3 million and $18.1 million, respectively. Our 2017 and 2016 net sales were $344.6 million and $324.2 million, respectively, and our 2017 and 2016 income from operations was $25.8 million and $32.9 million, respectively. We opened two new stores in 2018 and intend to open five to seven new stores in 2019. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had total assets of $297.6 million and $270.7 million, respectively.

 Key elements of our 2019 strategy include:
     Best Assortment – We offer an extensive assortment of approximately 6,000 natural stone and man-made tile products, setting and maintenance materials, accessories and tools. Our assortment is tailored to provide homeowners and professional customers distinctive products. We feature unique products and partner with industry-leading designers to curate collections that are sold exclusively in our stores. Our buying team sources products from across the world to provide our customers with good, better and best options to appeal to their individual tastes and budgets. We are committed to maintaining a product assortment that meets the needs of an upscale, fashion conscious homeowner, as well as all of the professional customers who serve that homeowner. We believe our ongoing emphasis on maintaining a best-in-class assortment is a critical component of our strategy. 
     Best Service – We are committed to providing our customers a high degree of in-store service through our motivated, well-trained store team members. We continue to make investments to improve our recruitment, management and development training practices, which reduced our sales associate turnover and increased our average manager tenure. The improvement in turnover and manager tenure has contributed to better product knowledge, store leadership, and overall customer experience. We also engage with our customers through our website (TileShop.com), which provides inspiration, enhanced product information, and research and design tools that support product selection. Our exceptional customer service gives customers the ability to design with confidence.
     Best Presentation – We bring our products to life in our stores by showcasing a broad array of the items we offer in up to 50 different vignettes of bathrooms, kitchens, fireplaces, foyers and other distinct spaces. We also showcase our products on our website. We are committed to maintaining our reputation as a destination store where customers find inspiration.
     Reaccelerate Store Growth – We plan to increase our existing store base by five to seven stores in 2019. All stores we intend to open in 2019 will be located in existing markets where we will be able to leverage economies of scale in marketing, distribution and store talent. Longer term, we believe we have exceptional opportunities to continue to add stores in existing markets and expand into new markets. Additionally, we will continue to focus on strategies to further enhance the return on our new store investments by selecting retail spaces that provide us the opportunity to reduce the initial investment to build a new store and, in some cases, the ongoing occupancy costs.
 ﻿
 Sales Model
 ﻿
 We principally sell our products directly to homeowners and professionals. With regard to individual customers, we believe that due to the average cost and relative infrequency of a tile purchase, many of our individual customers conduct extensive research using multiple channels before making a purchase decision. Our sales strategy emphasizes customer service by providing comprehensive and convenient educational tools on our website and in our stores for our customers to learn about our products and the tile installation process. Our website contains a broad range of information regarding our tile products, setting and maintenance materials, and accessories. Customers can order samples, view catalogs, or purchase products from our stores. Customers can choose to have their purchases delivered or picked up at one of our stores. We believe this strategy also positions us well with professional customers who are influenced by the preferences of individual homeowners.
 ﻿
 Our stores are designed to emphasize our products in a visually appealing showroom format. Our average store is approximately 20,200 square feet, with a majority of the square footage devoted to the showroom. Several thousand square feet is used for warehouse space, which is used primarily to hold customer orders waiting to be picked up or delivered. Our stores are typically accessible from major roadways and have significant visibility to passing traffic. We can adapt to a range of existing buildings, whether free-standing or in shopping centers. All of our stores are leased.
 ﻿
 Unlike many of our competitors, we devote a substantial portion of our store space to showrooms, including samples of our approximately 6,000 products and up to 50 different vignettes of bathrooms, kitchens, fireplaces, foyers, and other distinct spaces that showcase our products. Our showrooms are designed to provide our customers with a better understanding of how to integrate various types of tile in order to create an attractive presentation in their homes. Many stores are also equipped with a training center designed to teach customers how to properly install tile.

A staffing model for a typical store consists of a manager, an assistant manager, sales associates, and a warehouse leader. Our store managers are responsible for store operations and for overseeing our customers’ shopping experience. We offer financing to customers through a branded credit card provided by a third-party consumer finance company. 
 ﻿
 Marketing
 ﻿
 We utilize a variety of marketing strategies and programs to acquire and retain customers, including both consumers and trade professionals. Our advertising primarily consists of digital media, direct marketing, including email and postal mail, in store events, and mobile and traditional media vehicles, including newspaper circular/print ads, radio, video and out-of-home advertising. We continually test and learn from new media and adjust our programs based on performance.
 ﻿
 Our website, TileShop.com, supports desktop, tablet, and mobile devices and is designed for consumers, trade professionals and industry stakeholders to learn about our brand, our value propositions, and our product assortment and installation techniques, and to look up our store locations and account information. It hosts our Design Studio, a collaborative platform that enables the creation of customized 3D design renderings to scale, allowing customers to bring their ideas to life. On social media, #TheTileShop provides current and prospective customers a high level of brand engagement and enables customers to share their finished projects in our inspiration gallery. 
 ﻿

Natural stone products include marble, travertine, granite, quartz, sandstone, slate, and onyx tiles. Man-made products include ceramic, porcelain, glass, cement, wood look, and metal tiles. Our wide assortment of accessories, including trim pieces, mosaics, pencils, listellos, and other unique products encourages our customers to make a fashion statement with their tile project and helps us to deliver a high level of customer satisfaction and drive repeat business. We also offer a broad range of setting and maintenance materials, such as thinset, grout, sealers, and accessories, including installation tools, shower and bath shelves, drains, and similar products. We also offer customers delivery service through third-party freight providers. We sell most of our products under our proprietary brand names, including Superior Adhesives & Chemicals, Superior Tools & Supplies, Rush River, and Fired Earth.

  Suppliers
 ﻿
 We have long-standing relationships with our suppliers throughout the world and work with them to design and manufacture products exclusively for us. We believe that these direct relationships differentiate us from our competitors. 
 ﻿
 We currently purchase tile products from approximately 250 different suppliers. Our top ten tile suppliers accounted for 49% of our tile purchases in 2018. Our largest supplier accounted for approximately 14% of our total purchases in 2018. We believe that alternative and competitive suppliers are available for many of our products.

Distribution and Order Fulfillment
 ﻿
 We take possession of our products in the country of origin and arrange for transportation to our five distribution centers located in Michigan, Oklahoma, New Jersey, Virginia and Wisconsin. We also manufacture many of our setting and maintenance materials in Michigan, Oklahoma, Virginia, and Wisconsin. We maintain a large inventory of products in order to quickly fulfill customer orders. 
 ﻿
 We fulfill customer orders primarily by shipping our products to our stores where customers can either pick them up or arrange for home delivery. We continue to evaluate logistics alternatives to best serve our store base and our customers. We believe that our existing distribution facilities will continue to play an integral role in our growth strategy, and we expect to establish one or more additional distribution centers to support geographic expansion of our store base and to support our store growth plans.
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 The retail tile market is highly-fragmented. We compete directly with regional and local specialty retailers of tile, factory-direct stores, a large number of privately-owned, single-site stores, and online-only competitors. In addition, we complete with large national home improvement centers that offer a wide range of home improvement products, including flooring. We also compete indirectly with companies that sell other types of floor coverings, including wood floors, carpet, and vinyl. The barriers of entry into the retail tile industry are relatively low and new or existing tile retailers could enter our markets and increase the competition that we face. Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more varied product offerings, and greater financial, technical, and other resources.
 ﻿
 We believe that the key competitive factors in the retail tile industry include:

· | product assortment;
--+--------------------


· | product presentation;
--+----------------------


· | customer service;
--+------------------


· | store location;
--+----------------


· | availability of inventory; and
--+-------------------------------


· | price.
--+-------

  ﻿
 We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors by providing a highly diverse selection of products to our customers, at an attractive value, in appealing and convenient store locations, with exceptional customer service and on-site instructional opportunities. Further, while some larger factory-direct competitors manufacture their own products, many of our competitors do not maintain their own inventory and instead purchase their tile from domestic manufacturers or distributors when they receive an order from a customer. We also believe that we offer a broader range of products and stronger in-store customer support than these competitors.
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,738 employees, 1,626 of whom were full-time and none of whom were represented by a union. Of these employees, 1,340 work in our stores, 87 work in corporate, store support, infrastructure or similar functions, and 311 work in distribution and manufacturing facilities. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
 ﻿
 Property and Trademarks
 ﻿
 We have registered and unregistered trademarks for all of our brands, including 24 registered trademarks. We regard our intellectual property as having significant value and our brands are an important factor in the marketing of our products. Accordingly, we have taken, and continue to take, appropriate steps to protect our intellectual property.
 ﻿
 Government Regulation
 ﻿
 We are subject to extensive and varied federal, state and local government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees, public health and safety, zoning, and fire codes. We operate each of our stores, offices, and distribution and manufacturing facilities in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws, codes, and regulations.
 ﻿
 Our operations and properties are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, treatment, emission, release, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, substances, and wastes and relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, including off-site disposal locations.
