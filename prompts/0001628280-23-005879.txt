Item 1. Business
Overview
Forward Air Corporation (“Forward”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is a leading asset-light freight and logistics company. We provide less-than-truckload (“LTL”), final mile, truckload and intermodal drayage services across the United States and in Canada. We offer premium services that typically require precision execution, such as expedited transit, delivery during tight time windows and special handling. We utilize an asset-light strategy to minimize our investments in equipment and facilities and to reduce our capital expenditures. Forward Air was formed as a corporation under the laws of the State of Tennessee on October 23, 1981. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “FWRD”.
Discontinued Operation
On April 23, 2020, the Company made a decision to divest of Pool and the sale was completed on February 12, 2021. As a result, the results of Pool were classified to “Loss from discontinued operation, net of tax” in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2021. Certain corporate overhead and other costs previously allocated to Pool for segment reporting purposes did not qualify for classification within discontinued operation and were allocated to continuing operations. 
Services Provided
Our services are classified into two reportable segments: Expedited Freight and Intermodal. For financial information relating to each of our business segments, see Note 12, Segment Reporting to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
Expedited Freight. We operate a comprehensive national network that provides expedited regional, inter-regional and national LTL services. Expedited Freight offers customers local pick-up and delivery and other services including final mile, truckload, shipment consolidation and deconsolidation, warehousing, customs brokerage and other handling services. We have, and plan to continue to grow our LTL and final mile geographic footprints through greenfield start-ups as well as acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Expedited Freight accounted for 78.7% of our consolidated revenue.
Intermodal. We provide first- and last-mile high value intermodal container drayage services both to and from seaports and railheads. Intermodal also offers dedicated contract and Container Freight Station (“CFS”) warehouse and handling services. Intermodal operates primarily in the Midwest and Southeast, with a smaller operational presence in the Southwest, Mid-Atlantic, and West Coast. We have, and plan to grow Intermodal’s geographic footprint through greenfield start-ups where we do not have an acceptable acquisition target, as well as acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Intermodal accounted for 21.3% of our consolidated revenue.
Strategy
Our strategy is to take advantage of our core competencies in precision execution to provide asset-light freight and logistics services to profitably grow in the premium segments of the markets we serve. Principal components of our efforts include:
•Expand Service Offerings and Terminal Footprint. A key part of our growth strategy is to offer new and enhanced services that address our customers’ premium transportation needs. Over the past few years, we added or enhanced LTL pickup and delivery, final mile solutions, expedited truckload, temperature-controlled shipments, warehousing, drayage, customs brokerage and shipment consolidation and handling services. These services benefit our existing customers and increase our ability to attract new customers. Another part of our key growth strategy is to pursue geographic expansion in under penetrated markets to better meet the current and future needs of customers. As a result, we plan to invest in new terminals, in our trailer fleet and technology to enable us to efficiently handle the increased freight in the new markets.
•Manage Pricing and Freight Characteristics. Our business strategy involves managing both the price we charge for our services and the mix of freight we transport to operate our LTL network efficiently and more profitably. Over the past several years, we have implemented initiatives to improve the freight characteristics in our LTL network that has allowed us to increase our yield and revenue per shipment.
•Continue to Focus on Delivering Best-in-Class Service. The foundation of our growth strategy is our commitment to provide our customers with the most reliable and damage-free alternative for their shipments. Commitment to precision execution service is valued by customers and allows us to charge fair compensation for our services and positions us to improve market share.
•Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We continue to evaluate and pursue acquisitions that help expand geographic reach while gaining the business base of the acquired entity. In 2014 we created the foundation for what is our Intermodal segment by acquiring Central States Trucking Co. (“CST”). Since the acquisition of CST, we have completed fifteen additional intermodal acquisitions. In order to enhance our final mile footprint, we acquired FSA Network, Inc. (“FSA”) in April 2019, Linn Star Holdings, Inc., Linn Star Transfer, Inc. and Linn Star Logistics, LLC (collectively, “Linn Star”) in January 2020 and CLW Delivery, Inc. (“CLW”) in October 2020. In May 2021, we acquired J&P Hall Express Delivery (“J&P”) to expand the expedited LTL footprint across the Southeast. 
•Enhance Information Systems. We are committed to the development and enhancement of our information systems to provide competitive service advantages and increased productivity. We believe our information systems have and will assist us in capitalizing on new business opportunities with existing and new customers.
Operations
The following describes in more detail the operations of each of our reportable segments: Expedited Freight and Intermodal.
Expedited Freight
Overview
Our Expedited Freight segment provides expedited regional, inter-regional and national LTL, final mile and truckload services. We market our Expedited Freight services primarily to freight and logistics intermediaries (such as freight forwarders and third-party logistics companies), airlines (such as integrated air cargo carriers, and passenger and cargo airlines) and retailers (such as retailers of heavy bulky appliances). We offer our customers a high level of service with a focus on on-time, damage-free deliveries. Our Expedited Freight network encompasses approximately 92% of all continental U.S. zip codes, with service in Canada and Mexico.
Shipments
During 2022, approximately 28% of the freight handled by our LTL network was for overnight delivery, approximately 59% was for delivery within two to three days and the balance was for delivery in four or more days.
The average weekly volume of freight moving through our LTL network was approximately 54.8 million pounds per week and our average shipment weighed approximately 764 pounds in 2022. Although we impose no significant size or weight restrictions, we focus our marketing and price structure on shipments of 200 pounds or more.
Expedited Freight markets its services primarily to freight and logistics intermediaries; however, it may at times, provide such services to shippers if the opportunity is consistent with Expedited Freight’s strategy. Also, because Expedited Freight does not place significant size or weight restrictions on shipments, we generally do not compete directly with integrated air cargo carriers such as United Parcel Service and FedEx Corporation in the overnight delivery of small parcels.
The table below summarizes the average weekly volume of freight moving through our LTL network for each year since 2008.

 | Average Weekly 
 | Volume in Pounds
Year | (In millions) 
2008 | 34.2 
2009 | 28.5 
2010 | 32.6 
2011 | 34.0 
2012 | 34.9 
2013 | 35.4 
2014 | 37.4 
2015 | 47.2 
2016 | 46.5 
2017 | 49.5 
2018 | 50.2 
2019 | 48.6 
2020 | 46.3 
2021 | 55.4 
2022 | 54.8 

Transportation
Expedited Freight secures transportation capacity from four sources:
•independent contractors that own and lease their equipment (primarily tractors) to the Company (“Leased Capacity Providers”);
•third-party contracted motor carriers;
•capacity secured by transportation intermediaries, including freight brokers; and
•Company-owned equipment operated by employee drivers.

The majority of the transportation capacity utilized by Expedited Freight is provided by Leased Capacity Providers, with whom we seek to establish long-term relationships with to assure dependable service and availability. We believe Expedited Freight has experienced significantly higher average retention of Leased Capacity Providers compared to other over-the-road transportation providers. Expedited Freight has established specific guidelines relating to safety records, driving experience and personal evaluations that we use to select our Leased Capacity Providers. To enhance our relationship with the Leased Capacity Providers, Expedited Freight seeks to pay rates that are generally above prevailing market rates, and our Leased Capacity Providers often are able to negotiate a consistent work schedule for their drivers. Usually, Leased Capacity Providers negotiate schedules for their drivers that are between the same two cities or along a consistent route, improving quality of work life for the drivers of our Leased Capacity Providers and, in turn, increasing the retention rate of drivers and Leased Capacity Providers.
We also purchase transportation capacity supplied by third-party contracted motor carriers and transportation intermediaries. The majority of the transportation capacity utilized in our big and bulky final mile service is provided by third-party motor carriers, and we utilize capacity from both third-party motor carriers and transportation intermediaries to support other Expedited Freight service offerings in response to seasonal demands and volume surges in particular markets, to handle overflow volume. A small portion of Expedited Freight's transportation capacity is provided by employee drivers operating company-owned equipment.
Other Services
Expedited Freight provides additional value-added services that are integrated into the overall operation of its network.
Expedited Freight offers final mile services which include the delivery and installation of heavy bulky appliances such as washing machines, dryers, dishwashers and refrigerators. We significantly expanded the final mile geographic footprint and operate in over 117 locations nationwide. Expedited Freight continues to integrate these deliveries into its LTL pickup and delivery and terminal operations so as to increase network density and lower overall LTL unit costs.
Expedited Freight offers truckload services which include expedited truckload brokerage, dedicated fleet services, as well as high security and temperature-controlled logistics services.
Other Expedited Freight services allow customers to access the following services from a single source:
•customs brokerage;
•warehousing, dock and office space;
•hotshot or ad hoc ultra-expedited services; and
•shipment consolidation and handling, such as shipment build-up and break-down and reconsolidation of air or ocean pallets or containers.
Customers
Our Expedited Freight wholesale customer base is primarily comprised of freight forwarders, third-party logistics (“3PL”) companies, integrated air cargo carriers and passenger, cargo airlines, steamship lines and retailers. Expedited Freight’s freight forwarder customers vary in size from small, independent, single facility companies to large, international logistics companies. Our dependable service and wide-ranging service offerings also make Expedited Freight an attractive option for 3PL providers, which is one of the fastest growing segments in the transportation industry. Integrated air cargo carriers use our network to provide overflow capacity and other services, including shipment of bigger packages and pallet-loaded cargo. In 2022, Expedited Freight’s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 38% of its revenue and no single customer had revenue greater than 10% of Expedited Freight revenue for 2022. 
Intermodal
Overview
Our Intermodal segment provides first- and last-mile high value intermodal container drayage services both to and from seaports and railheads. Intermodal also offers dedicated contract and container freight station (“CFS”) warehouse and handling services. Intermodal also provides linehaul and local less-than-truckload service in the Midwest, as well as CFS warehousing services (e.g. devanning, unit load device build-up/tear-down, and security screening) for air and ocean import/export freight at five of its Midwest terminals. Our Intermodal service differentiators include:
•Immediate proof of delivery and signature capture capability via tablets;
•All drivers receive dispatch orders on hand-held units and are trackable via GPS; and
•Daily container visibility and per diem management reports.
Operations
Intermodal’s primary office is located in Oak Brook, Illinois. Intermodal’s network consists of 30 locations primarily in the Midwest and Southeast, with a smaller operational presence in the Southwest, Mid-Atlantic, and West Coast. 
Transportation
Intermodal utilizes a mix of Company-employed drivers, Leased Capacity Providers and third-party motor carriers. During 2022, approximately 71% of Intermodal’s direct transportation expenses were provided by Leased Capacity Providers, 24% by Company-employed drivers, and 5% by third-party motor carriers.
All of our Intermodal company and independent contractor tractors are equipped with computer tablets, which enable us to communicate with our drivers, plan and monitor shipment progress and monitor our drivers’ hours of service. We use the real-time global positioning data obtained from these devices to improve customer and driver service, and provide a high level of shipment visibility to our customers (including immediate proof of delivery signature capture). We believe that our technology is a key differentiator and enables us to provide a higher level of service than our competitors.
Customers
Intermodal’s customer base is primarily comprised of international freight forwarders, passenger and cargo airlines, beneficial cargo owners and steamship lines. In 2022, Intermodal’s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 33% of its operating revenue and had one customer with revenue greater than 10% of Intermodal revenue for 2022.
Competition
We compete in the North American transportation and logistics services industry, and the markets in which we operate are highly competitive, very fragmented and historically have few barriers to entry. We compete with a large number of other asset-light logistics companies, asset-based carriers, integrated logistics companies, and third-party freight brokers. To a lesser extent, we also compete with integrated air cargo carriers and passenger airlines. Our competition ranges from small operators that operate within a limited geographic area to companies with substantially greater financial and other resources, including greater freight capacity.
Our Expedited Freight segment primarily competes with other national and regional truckload carriers. Expedited Freight also competes with less-than-truckload carriers, and to a lesser extent, integrated air cargo carriers and passenger and cargo airlines. Our Intermodal segment primarily competes with national and regional drayage providers.
We believe competition in our segments is based primarily on quality of service, price, available capacity, on-time delivery, flexibility, reliability, security, transportation rates, location of facilities, and business relationships, and we believe we compete favorably with other transportation service companies in these areas. To that end, we believe our Expedited Freight segment has an advantage over other truckload and less-than-truckload carriers because Expedited Freight delivers faster, more reliable services between cities at rates that are generally significantly below the price to transport the same shipments to the same destinations by air. We believe our Intermodal segment has a competitive advantage over other drayage providers because we deliver more reliable service while offering greater shipment visibility and security. Additionally, we believe our Intermodal segment is one of the leading providers of drayage and related services in North America today. 
Marketing
We market all of our services through a sales and marketing team located in major markets of the United States. Senior leadership is also actively involved in sales and marketing to national and local accounts. We participate in trade shows and advertise our services through digital marketing channels, trade publications, and the Internet via www.tlxpedited.com, www.forwardair.com, www.forwardaircorp.com, and www.forward-intermodal.com. Our websites promote and describe our services in addition to lead generation support. The information on our websites is not part of this filing and is therefore not incorporated by reference unless such information is specifically referenced elsewhere in this report.
Seasonality
Generally, our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis with the first quarter the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have been the strongest. This seasonal pattern has been the result of numerous factors such as economic conditions, customer demand, weather, and national holidays. Additionally, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers whose business levels are impacted by trends in the economy.
Workforce
We recognize that our workforce, including our freight handlers, is our most valuable asset. Through ongoing talent development, comprehensive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health, safety and employee well-being, we strive to help our employees in all aspects of their lives so they can do their best at work. The recruitment, training and retention of qualified employees is essential to support our continued growth and to meet the service requirements of our customers.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 4,155 full-time employees, 924 of whom were freight handlers and an additional 272 part-time employees, the majority of whom were freight handlers. In 2022, none of our employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Roadway Health and Safety
We are committed to educating our employees and promoting driver health and wellness through routine communication campaigns and information designed to emphasize the importance of safe operations. Drivers of our Leased Capacity Providers complete a three-day safety orientation as part of their onboarding where they are assigned several training courses, and from time-to-time, additional safety trainings may also be assigned on an ongoing basis, dependent upon driving behaviors.
We invest in a variety of programs focused on improving and maintaining driver health and wellness. We provide drivers access to a fatigue management service with the goal of reducing fatigue-related accidents and encouraging healthy, restful sleep. We have implemented fleet safety equipment, including electronic monitoring systems, to track driver safety, well-being, and health through monitoring of speed and proper hours-of-service-required rest breaks.
We provide a quarterly safety bonus and annual vehicle giveaway to incentivize our Leased Capacity Providers to promote safe driving practices. Both initiatives celebrate drivers of our Leased Capacity Providers who have zero moving violations or accidents on a quarterly basis. Drivers who obtain four quarterly bonuses are eligible to win a new vehicle. In 2022, 209 Leased Capacity Providers as well as Company-employed drivers qualified for the vehicle giveaway. Looking ahead, we will continue to identify and promote programs that focus on the health and wellness for the drivers of our Leased Capacity Providers.
Workplace Health and Safety
We are committed to the safety of our employees and independent contractors. Our safety program focuses on risk reduction and safety management procedures that promote preventative measures.
We employ, maintain, and monitor a robust health and safety program for all of our workers to prevent workplace incidents. Policies and procedures exist to investigate accidents and monitor lessons learned, driving continuous improvement in the health and safety practices across our facilities. All of our employees are assigned to training courses as part of onboarding and employees may be assigned additional refresher trainings based on corrective action or identified risk.
Diversity
We believe that our employees’ unique and diverse capabilities positively impact our success. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with a highly skilled and diverse board. Since 2017, we added four female directors to our Board, two directors who identify as Hispanic, one director who identifies as African American and one director who identifies as Indian.

We are committed to further increase the percentage of diverse representation in our overall employee base as well as to further initiatives for compensation equity, employee engagement, development and inclusion. We believe that incorporating diversity and inclusion (“D&I”) initiatives into our everyday business practices enhances innovation and enables diversity of thought. Building upon our core values, our employees value learning from different perspectives and welcome the opportunity to work with those of diverse backgrounds. Through our D&I initiatives, employees take part in robust training, such as understanding diversity, generational awareness, and emotional intelligence. We also provide our employees with Employee Resource Groups to help foster a diverse and inclusive workplace as well as provide for the growth and development of underrepresented groups.
Compensation
We regularly review surveys of market rates for jobs to ensure our compensation practices are competitive. We are committed to providing total rewards that are market-competitive and performance-based, driving innovation and operational excellence. Our compensation programs, practices, and policies reflect our commitment to reward short- and long-term performance that aligns with, and drives shareholder value. Total direct compensation is generally positioned within a competitive range of the market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency, and performance to attract and retain key talent. In addition to salaries, our compensation programs include annual incentive bonuses, stock awards, and participation in a retirement savings plan, dependent upon the position and level of employee. We also invest in talent development initiatives to support the ongoing career development of all employees, including learning workshops that target all levels of employees.
Equipment
We manage a trailer pool that is utilized by all of our businesses to move freight through our networks. Our trailer pool includes dry van, refrigerated and roller-bed trailers, and substantially all of our trailers are 53 feet long. We own the majority of the trailers we use, but we supplement at times with leased trailers. As of December 31, 2022, we had 6,021 owned trailers in our fleet with an average age of approximately nine years. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we also had 705 leased trailers in our fleet. As of December 31, 2022, we had 273 owned tractors and straight trucks in our fleet, with an average age of approximately three years. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we also had 643 leased tractors and straight trucks in our fleet.
Corporate Sustainability
We embrace a comprehensive approach to sustainability that addresses Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) factors. 
Our integrated framework focuses on three pillars: (i) People and Communities; (ii) Customer; and (iii) Environment. After completing an ESG assessment in 2020 utilizing the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards and conducting a third-party stakeholder assessment, we identified ten ESG priority areas within these three pillars that we believe are relevant to our business and important to our employees, communities, cusotmers, investors, partners and contractors, and which form the foundation for our sustainability strategy:

• Roadway Health & Safety | • Measurement & Disclosure 
• Workplace Health & Safety | • Information Security 
• Independent Contractor Practices | • Responsible Supplier Practices 
• Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEI&B) Practices | • Green House Gas (GHG) Emissions Reduction Practices 
• Community Impact & Partnerships | • Air Quality Practices 

Since 2019, we have deployed meaningful resources to manage sustainability risks and to capitalize on related opportunities for the benefit of our stakeholders. In 2019, our Board amended the Corporate Governance and Nominating (“CG&N”) Committee Charter to give the CG&N Committee oversight over our ESG-related efforts. At least twice a year, the CG&N Committee is updated on each of these topics and provides feedback and direction that it deems appropriate. At least annually, the Chair of the CG&N Committee will provide a report on these topics to the full Board.
In 2020, Forward’s leadership created the Head of Corporate ESG role to provide oversight of Forward’s ESG vision, strategic planning, performance management, and improvement activities. 
In 2021, we published our first ESG Report and created our internal ESG Steering Committee, which oversees our company-wide ESG strategy and meets at least quarterly and on an as-needed basis.
In 2022, we streamlined our internal data collection process, completed our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory, set measurable targets and goals, and published our second ESG report through the launch of our new ESG website which we will update annually with our progress. The ESG report and new website are accessible through our investor relations site, https://ir.forwardaircorp.com/esg. The information on our website and our ESG report are not incorporated into, and are not a part of, this report.
People and Communities
We are committed to maintaining safe facilities for our employees, independent contractors, customers and partners. As part of this pillar, we focus on Roadway Health & Safety, Workplace Health & Safety, Independent Contractor Practices, and DEI&B Practices.
For instance, we employ, maintain, and monitor a robust Health and Safety program for all of our workers which establishes procedures and policies to prevent workplace incidents. As part of our assessment, we have identified improvement activities to develop a comprehensive Emergency Preparedness Plan (“EPP”) for all our facilities. The EPP is under 
development and in compliance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910 standards and FMCSA 49 CFR. When completed, we will distribute and maintain this EPPP for employees and independent contractors alike, across our facilities and corporate offices.
We also remain committed to fostering a more diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment. In 2020, we created a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEI&B) Council to promote employee inclusion and engagement. Since the creation of the DEI&B Council, among other initiatives, we have implemented paid parental leave, launched Employee Resource Groups to foster an inclusive environment and celebrated different cultures by commemorating key diversity holidays, observances, celebrations and provided floating paid holidays.
We are committed to supporting and giving back to the communities where we live and work, particularly through the support of our employee Veterans, and to the community of Veterans in North America. For instance, we continue to support our Veterans through our charitable organization, Operation: Forward Freedom, a manifestation of our ongoing commitment to Veteran-related causes. In 2022, we hosted our first annual Drive for Hope Golf tournament where we raised more than $375,000 for Hope for the Warriors. Hope for the Warriors is a 501c3 nonprofit whose mission is to care for and empower service members and military families challenged by the physical, moral and psychological effects of war. 
We also partner with non-profit organizations that positively impact our communities and our industry such as Truckers Against Trafficking, Women in Trucking and Drexel Hamilton.
Customer
We are committed to providing the industry's highest quality service in delivering on our customers' expectations. As part of this pillar, we focus on Measurement & Disclosure, Information Security, and Responsible Supplier Practices.
We remain committed to transparent and sustainable business practices. As part of this ongoing commitment, we have transformed and innovated several of our digital and cloud technologies to create more efficient and integrated processes. We deploy various programs, including Safety and Environmental Management Systems, to collect meaningful data that is communicated with all divisions and management.
We have also employed proactive measures to protect our network, computer systems and data from cyber threats, in part, by creating a robust Information Security program in early 2020. We are continuously deploying infrastructure to meet the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requirements.
As part of our Responsible Supplier program, we work to understand the ESG goals of both our suppliers and customers. By 2024, we expect to establish data tracking infrastructure and explore opportunities to grow our supplier diversity program and partnerships. We aim to establish supplier diversification goals in the coming years.
Environment
We are committed to promoting a healthier natural and built environment by striving for continuous environmental improvements in all aspects of our business. Environmental leadership requires not only our own action, but transparency and participation in the industry, including conversations about innovations and advancements that make a difference. As part of this pillar, we focus on GHG Emissions Reduction Practices and Air Quality Practices.
As a transportation company, we are conscious of the environmental effects of our operations and are committed to tracking and reducing our GHG emissions and improving our energy efficiency. We have established a preliminary goal to reduce absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions (combined) by 2030 from a 2021 base year. As part of this goal, in 2022, we partnered with carbon capture company Remora, reserving ten of its mobile devices for a pilot project tentatively scheduled for the second half of 2023. We are also aligning with industry certifications, continuing to be a SmartWay certified company. SmartWay is a certification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) verifying company compliance with EPA regulations, including fuel efficiency ranges and emission standards.

The information in our ESG report is not incorporated into, and is not a part of, this report. We are committed to making our results count and will continue to update our future disclosures accordingly.
Risk Management and Litigation
Under DOT regulations, we are liable for bodily injury and property damage caused by Leased Capacity Providers and employee drivers while they are operating equipment under our various motor carrier authorities. The potential liability associated with any accident can be severe and occurrences are unpredictable. 
For vehicle liability, we retain a portion of the risk. Below is a summary of our risk retention on vehicle liability insurance coverage maintained by us through $10,000 (in thousands):

 | Risk Retention | | Frequency | Layer | Policy Term 
Expedited Freight¹ | | | | | 
LTL business | $ | 5,000 | | Occurrence/Accident² | $0 to $5,000 | 10/1/2022 to 10/1/2023
Truckload business | $ | 2,000 | | Occurrence/Accident² | $0 to $2,000 | 10/1/2022 to 10/1/2023
LTL, Truckload and Intermodal businesses | $ | 5,000 | | Policy Term Aggregate³ | $5,000 to $10,000 | 10/1/2022 to 10/1/2023
Intermodal | $ | 1,000 | | Occurrence/Accident² | $0 to $1,000 | 10/1/2022 to 10/1/2023

¹ Excluding the Final Mile business, which is primarily a brokered service.
² For each and every accident/incident, we are responsible for damages and defense up to these amounts, regardless of the number of claims associated with any accident/incident.
³ During the Policy Term, we are responsible for damages and defense within the stated Layer up to the stated, aggregate amount of Risk Retention before insurance will contribute. 
Also, from time to time, when brokering freight, we may face claims for the “negligent selection” of outside, contracted carriers that are involved in accidents, and we maintain third-party liability insurance coverage with a $100 deductible per occurrence for most of our brokered services. Additionally, we maintain workers’ compensation insurance with a self-insured retention of $500 per occurrence. We cannot guarantee that our self-insurance retention levels will not increase and/or that we may have to agree to more unfavorable policy terms as a result of market conditions, poor claims experience or other factors. We could incur claims in excess of our policy limits or incur claims not covered by our insurance. Any claims beyond the limits or scope of our insurance coverage may have a material adverse effect on us. Because we do not carry “stop loss” insurance, a significant increase in the number of claims that we must cover under our self-insurance retainage could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, we may be unable to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against losses.
From time to time, we are a party to other litigation arising in the normal course of our business, most of which involve claims for personal injury, property damage related to the transportation and handling of freight, or workers’ compensation. We do not believe that any of these pending actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Regulation
We are regulated by various United States and state agencies, including the DOT. The DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), an agency within the DOT, manages a Compliance, Safety, Accountability initiative (“CSA”) which governs matters such as safety requirements and compliance, registration to engage in motor carrier operations, drivers’ hours of service (“HOS”) requirements, and certain mergers, consolidations, and acquisitions. We are also subject to laws and regulations under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which regulate safety, the supervision of hazardous materials, water discharges, air emissions, solid waste disposal and the release and cleanup of other substances. These regulatory authorities have broad powers, generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations, as well as motor carrier registration, driver hours of service, safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers, transportation of hazardous materials, certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting. The trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities, which address matters such as: increasingly stringent environmental, occupational safety and health regulations, limits on vehicle weight and size, ergonomics, port security, and hours of service. In addition, we are subject to compliance with cargo-security and transportation regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and our domestic customs brokerage operations are licensed by CBP.
We are also subject to employment laws and regulations, including the changing regulatory landscape, with the potential effects of California Assembly Bill 5 (“California AB5”), which introduced a new test for determining worker classification that is viewed as expanding the scope of employee relationships and narrowing the scope of independent contractor relationships.
Additionally, our Canada business activities are subject to similar requirements imposed by the laws and regulations of Canada, as well as its provincial laws and regulations. Regulatory requirements, and changes in regulatory requirements, may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing transportation services.

We are an electronic filer and the SEC maintains an Internet site at www.sec.gov that contains these reports and other information filed electronically. We make available free of charge through the Investor Relations portion of our website such reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Our website address is www.forwardaircorp.com. Our goal is to maintain our website as a portal through which investors can easily find or navigate to pertinent information about us. The information provided on the website is not part of this report, and is therefore not incorporated by reference unless such information is otherwise specifically referenced elsewhere in this report.
