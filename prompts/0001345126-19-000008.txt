ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Compass Diversified Holdings, a Delaware statutory trust (“Holdings”, or the “Trust”), was incorporated in Delaware on November 18, 2005. Compass Group Diversified Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability Company (the “Company”), was also formed on November 18, 2005. The Trust and the Company (collectively “CODI”) were formed to acquire and manage a group of small and middle-market businesses headquartered in North America. The Trust is the sole owner of 100% of the Trust Interests, as defined in our LLC Agreement, of the Company. Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, the Trust owns an identical number of Trust Interests in the Company as exist for the number of outstanding shares of the Trust. Accordingly, our shareholders are treated as beneficial owners of Trust Interests in the Company and, as such, are subject to tax under partnership income tax provisions.
The Company is the operating entity with a board of directors whose corporate governance responsibilities are similar to that of a Delaware corporation. The Company’s board of directors oversees the management of the Company and our businesses and the performance of Compass Group Management LLC (“CGM” or our “Manager”). Certain persons who are employees and partners of our Manager receive a profit allocation as beneficial owners of 49.0% through Sostratus LLC of the Allocation Interests in us, as defined in our LLC Agreement.
Overview
We acquire controlling interests in and actively manage businesses that we believe (i) operate in industries with long-term macroeconomic growth opportunities, (ii) have positive and stable cash flows, (iii) face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence, and (iv) have strong management teams largely in place.
Our unique public structure provides investors with an opportunity to participate in the ownership and growth of companies which have historically been owned by private equity firms, wealthy individuals or families. Through the acquisition of a diversified group of businesses with these characteristics, we believe we offer investors an opportunity to diversify their own portfolio risk while participating in the ongoing cash flows of those businesses through the receipt of quarterly distributions.
Our disciplined approach to our target market provides opportunities to methodically purchase attractive businesses at values that are accretive to our shareholders. For sellers of businesses, our unique financial structure allows us to acquire businesses efficiently with little or no third party financing contingencies and, following acquisition, to provide our businesses with substantial access to growth capital.
We believe that private company operators and corporate parents looking to sell their business units may consider us an attractive purchaser because of our ability to:

• | provide ongoing strategic and financial support for their businesses;


• | maintain a long-term outlook as to the ownership of those businesses where such an outlook is required for maximization of our shareholders’ return on investment; and


• | consummate transactions efficiently without being dependent on third-party transaction financing.

In particular, we believe that our outlook on length of ownership and active management on our part may alleviate the concern that many private company operators and parent companies may have with regard to their businesses going through multiple sale processes in a short period of time. We believe this outlook reduces both the risk that businesses may be sold at unfavorable points in the overall market cycle and enhances our ability to develop a comprehensive strategy to grow the earnings and cash flows of each of our businesses, which we expect will better enable us to meet our long-term objective of continuing to pay distributions to our shareholders while increasing shareholder value. Finally, it has been our experience, that our ability to acquire businesses without the cumbersome delays and conditions typical of third party transactional financing is appealing to sellers of businesses who are interested in confidentiality and certainty to close.
We believe our management team’s strong relationships with industry executives, accountants, attorneys, business brokers, commercial and investment bankers, and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities offer us substantial opportunities to assess small to middle market businesses available for acquisition. In addition, the flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions allows us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target.

In terms of the businesses in which we have a controlling interest as of December 31, 2018, we believe that these businesses have strong management teams, operate in strong markets with defensible market niches and maintain long-standing customer relationships. 
We categorize the businesses we own into two separate groups of businesses (i) branded consumer businesses and, (ii) niche industrial businesses. Branded consumer businesses are characterized as those businesses that we believe capitalize on a valuable brand name in their respective market sector. We believe that our branded consumer businesses are leaders in their particular product category. Niche industrial businesses are characterized as those businesses that focus on manufacturing and selling particular products and industrial services within a specific market sector. We believe that our niche industrial businesses are leaders in their specific market sector.

Our Manager
Our Manager, CGM, has been engaged to manage the day-to-day operations and affairs of the Company and to execute our strategy, as discussed below. Collectively, our management team has extensive experience in acquiring and managing small and middle market businesses. We believe our Manager is unique in the marketplace in terms of the success and experience of its employees in acquiring and managing diverse businesses of the size and general nature of our businesses. We believe this experience will provide us with an advantage in executing our overall strategy. Our management team devotes a majority of its time to the affairs of the Company.
11

We have entered into a management services agreement, (the “Management Services Agreement” or “MSA”) pursuant to which our Manager manages the day-to-day operations and affairs of the Company and oversees the management and operations of our businesses. We pay our Manager a quarterly management fee for the services it performs on our behalf. In addition, certain persons who are employees and partners of our Manager receive a profit allocation with respect to its Allocation Interests in us. All of the Allocation Interests in us are owned by Sostratus LLC. See Part III, Item 13 “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions” for further descriptions of the management fees and profit allocations.
The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are employees of our Manager and have been seconded to us. Neither the Trust nor the Company has any other employees. Although our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are employees of our Manager, they report directly to the Company’s board of directors. The management fee paid to our Manager covers all expenses related to the services performed by our Manager, including the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and other personnel providing services to us. The Company reimburses our Manager for the compensation and related costs and expenses of our Chief Financial Officer and his staff, who dedicate substantially all of their time to the affairs of the Company.
See Part III, Item 13, “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence.”
Market Opportunity
We acquire and actively manage small and middle market businesses. We characterize small to middle market businesses as those that generate annual cash flows of up to $60 million. We believe that the merger and acquisition market for small to middle market businesses is highly fragmented and provides opportunities to purchase businesses at attractive prices. We believe that the following factors contribute to lower acquisition multiples for small and middle market businesses:

• | there are fewer potential acquirers for these businesses;


• | third-party financing generally is less available for these acquisitions;


• | sellers of these businesses frequently consider non-economic factors, such as continuing board membership or the effect of the sale on their employees; and


• | these businesses are less frequently sold pursuant to an auction process.

Frequently, opportunities exist to augment existing management at such businesses and improve the performance of these businesses upon their acquisition. In the past, our management team has acquired businesses that were owned by entrepreneurs or large corporate parents. In these cases, our management team has frequently found that there have been opportunities to further build upon the management teams of acquired businesses beyond those that existed at the time of acquisition. In addition, our management team has frequently found that financial reporting and management information systems of acquired businesses may be improved, both of which can lead to improvements in earnings and cash flow. Finally, because these businesses tend to be too small to have their own corporate development efforts, opportunities frequently exist to assist these businesses as they pursue organic or external growth strategies that were often not pursued by their previous owners.
Our Strategy
We have two primary strategies that we use in order to provide distributions to our shareholders and increase shareholder value. First, we focus on growing the earnings and cash flow from our acquired businesses. We believe that the scale and scope of our businesses give us a diverse base of cash flow upon which to further build. Second, we identify, perform due diligence on, negotiate and consummate additional platform acquisitions of small to middle market businesses in attractive industry sectors in accordance with acquisition criteria established by the board of directors.
Management Strategy
Our management strategy involves the proactive financial and operational management of the businesses we own in order to increase cash flow, pay distributions to our shareholders and increase shareholder value. Our Manager oversees and supports the management teams of each of our businesses by, among other things:

• | recruiting and retaining talented managers to operate our businesses using structured incentive compensation programs, including non-controlling equity ownership, tailored to each business;

12


• | regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals;


• | assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic growth strategies;


• | identifying and working with management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities;


• | assisting management in controlling and right-sizing overhead costs; and


• | forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives.

Specifically, while our businesses have different growth opportunities and potential rates of growth, we expect our Manager to work with the management teams of each of our businesses to increase the value of, and cash generated by, each business through various initiatives, including:

• | making selective capital investments to expand geographic reach, increase capacity, or reduce manufacturing costs of our businesses;


• | investing in product research and development for new products, processes or services for customers;


• | improving and expanding existing sales and marketing programs;


• | pursuing reductions in operating costs through improved operational efficiency or outsourcing of certain processes and products; and


• | consolidating or improving management of certain overhead functions.

Our businesses typically acquire and integrate complementary businesses. We believe that complementary add-on acquisitions improve our overall financial and operational performance by allowing us to:

• | leverage manufacturing and distribution operations;


• | leverage branding and marketing programs, as well as customer relationships;


• | add experienced management or management expertise;


• | increase market share and penetrate new markets; and


• | realize cost synergies by allocating the corporate overhead expenses of our businesses across a larger number of businesses and by implementing and coordinating improved management practices.

We incur third party debt financing almost entirely at the Company level, which we use, in combination with our equity capital, to provide debt financing to each of our businesses and to acquire additional businesses. We believe this financing structure is beneficial to the financial and operational activities of each of our businesses by aligning our interests as both equity holders of, and lenders to, our businesses, in a manner that we believe is more efficient than each of our businesses borrowing from third-party lenders.
Acquisition Strategy
Our acquisition strategy involves the acquisition of businesses that we expect to produce stable and growing earnings and cash flow. In this respect, we expect to make acquisitions in industries other than those in which our businesses currently operate if we believe an acquisition presents an attractive opportunity. We believe that attractive opportunities will continue to present themselves, as private sector owners seek to monetize their interests in long-standing and privately-held businesses and large corporate parents seek to dispose of their “non-core” operations.
Our ideal acquisition candidate has the following characteristics:

• | is an established North American based company;


• | maintains a significant market share in defensible industry niche (i.e., has a “reason to exist”);


• | has a solid and proven management team with meaningful incentives;


• | has low technological and/or product obsolescence risk; and


• | maintains a diversified customer and supplier base.

We benefit from our Manager’s ability to identify potential diverse acquisition opportunities in a variety of industries. In addition, we rely upon our management team’s experience and expertise in researching and valuing prospective target businesses, as well as negotiating the ultimate acquisition of such target businesses. In particular, because there may be a lack of information available about these target businesses, which may make it more difficult to understand or appropriately value such target businesses, on our behalf, our Manager:
13


• | engages in a substantial level of internal and third-party due diligence;


• | critically evaluates the target management team;


• | identifies and assesses any financial and operational strengths and weaknesses of the target business;


• | analyzes comparable businesses to assess financial and operational performances relative to industry competitors;


• | actively researches and evaluates information on the relevant industry; and


• | thoroughly negotiates appropriate terms and conditions of any acquisition.

The process of acquiring new businesses is both time-consuming and complex. Our management team historically has taken from two to twenty-four months to perform due diligence, negotiate and close acquisitions. Although our management team is always at various stages of evaluating several transactions at any given time, there may be periods of time during which our management team does not recommend any new acquisitions to us. Even if an acquisition is recommended by our management team, our board of directors may not approve it.
A component of our acquisition financing strategy that we utilize in acquiring the businesses we own and manage is to provide both equity capital and debt capital, raised at the parent company level largely through our existing credit facility, to close acquisitions. We believe, and it has been our experience, that having the ability to finance our acquisitions with capital resources raised by us, rather than negotiating separate third party financing, provides us with an advantage in successfully acquiring attractive businesses by minimizing delay and closing conditions that are often related to acquisition-specific financings. In addition, our strategy of providing this intercompany debt financing within the capital structure of the businesses we acquire and manage allows us the ability to distribute cash to the parent company through monthly interest payments and amortization of principle on these intercompany loans.
Upon acquisition of a new business, we rely on our Manager’s experience and expertise to work efficiently and effectively with the management of the new business to jointly develop and execute a successful business plan.
We believe our financing structure, in which both equity and debt capital are raised at the Company level, allows us to acquire businesses without transaction specific financing and is conducive to our ability to consummate transactions that may be attractive in both the short and long-term.
In addition to acquiring businesses, we sell those businesses that we own from time to time when attractive opportunities arise that outweigh the future growth and value that we believe we will be able to bring such businesses consistent with our long-term investment strategy. As such, our decision to sell a business is based on our belief that doing so will increase shareholder value to a greater extent than through our continued ownership of that business. Upon the sale of a business, we may use the proceeds to retire debt or retain proceeds for acquisitions or general corporate purposes. We do not expect to make special distributions at the time of a sale of one of our businesses; instead, we expect to pay shareholder distributions over time solely through the earnings and cash flows of our businesses.
Since our inception in May 2006, we have recorded net gains on sales of our businesses of approximately $772 million. We sold Crosman Acquisition Company (“Crosman”) in January 2007, Aeroglide Company (“Aeroglide”) and Silvue Technologies Group, Inc. (“Silvue”) in June 2008, Staffmark Holdings Inc. (“Staffmark”) in October 2011, HALO Branded Solutions (“HALO”) in May 2012, CamelBak Products, LLC ("CamelBak") in August 2015, American Furniture Manufacturing, Inc. ("American Furniture") in October 2015, and Tridien Medical Inc. ("Tridien") in September 2016. In addition, we sold our Fox Factory Holding Corp. ("FOX") subsidiary through an initial public offering and secondary issuances from August 2013 through March 2017. We sold our Manitoba Harvest Business in February 2019 and anticipate recording a gain on sale during the first quarter of 2019. 
Investment in FOX
We made loans to and purchased a controlling interest in FOX on January 4, 2008, for approximately $80.4 million. In August 2013, FOX completed an initial public offering of its common stock. As a result of the initial public offering, our ownership interest in FOX was reduced to approximately 53.9%. No gain was reflected as a result of the sale of our FOX shares in the initial public offering because our majority classification of FOX did not change. FOX used a portion of their net proceeds received from the sale of their shares as well as proceeds from a new external FOX credit facility to repay $61.5 million in outstanding indebtedness to us under their existing credit facility with us. In July 2014, through a secondary offering, our ownership in FOX was lowered from approximately 53% to approximately 41%, and as a result we deconsolidated FOX as of July 10, 2014. In March and August 2016, through two more secondary offerings and a share repurchase by FOX, our ownership in the outstanding common stock of FOX was further lowered to approximately 23% as of September 30, 2016. In November 2016, through another secondary offering, our ownership 
14

in the outstanding common stock of FOX was further lowered to approximately 14%. On March 13, 2017, FOX closed on a secondary public offering of 5,108,718 shares of FOX common stock held by CODI, which represented CODI's remaining investment in FOX. CODI received $136.1 million in net proceeds as a result of the sale. We recognized total net proceeds from the sales of our FOX shares of approximately $465.1 million, and a total gain of $428.7 million.
Strategic Advantages
Based on the experience of our management team and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions, we believe we are well-positioned to acquire additional businesses. Our management team has strong relationships with business brokers, investment and commercial bankers, accountants, attorneys and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities. In addition, our management team also has a successful track record of acquiring and managing small to middle market businesses in various industries. In negotiating these acquisitions, we believe our management team has been able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions, including corporate spin-offs, transitions of family-owned businesses, management buy-outs and reorganizations.
Our management team has a large network that we estimate to be approximately 2,000 deal intermediaries who we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions. Through this network, as well as our management team’s proprietary transaction sourcing efforts, we have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets. Our management team also has a well-established network of contacts, including professional managers, attorneys, accountants and other third-party consultants and advisors, who may be available to assist us in the performance of due diligence and the negotiation of acquisitions, as well as the management and operation of our acquired businesses.
Finally, because we intend to fund acquisitions through the utilization of our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility, we expect to minimize the delays and closing conditions typically associated with transaction specific financing, as is typically the case in such acquisitions. We believe this advantage can be a powerful one, especially in a tight credit environment, and is highly unusual in the marketplace for acquisitions in which we operate.
Valuation and Due Diligence
When evaluating businesses or assets for acquisition, our management team performs a rigorous due diligence and financial evaluation process. In doing so, we evaluate the operations of the target business as well as the outlook for the industry in which the target business operates. While valuation of a business is, by definition, a subjective process, we define valuations under a variety of analyses, including:

• | discounted cash flow analyses;


• | evaluation of trading values of comparable companies;


• | expected value matrices; and


• | examination of comparable recent transactions.

One outcome of this process is a projection of the expected cash flows from the target business. A further outcome is an understanding of the types and levels of risk associated with those projections. While future performance and projections are always uncertain, we believe that with detailed due diligence, future cash flows will be better estimated and the prospects for operating the business in the future better evaluated. To assist us in identifying material risks and validating key assumptions in our financial and operational analysis, in addition to our own analysis, we engage third-party experts to review key risk areas, including legal, tax, regulatory, accounting, insurance and environmental. We also engage technical, operational or industry consultants, as necessary.
A further critical component of the evaluation of potential target businesses is the assessment of the capability of the existing management team, including recent performance, expertise, experience, culture and incentives to perform. Where necessary, and consistent with our management strategy, we actively seek to augment, supplement or replace existing members of management who we believe are not likely to execute our business plan for the target business. Similarly, we analyze and evaluate the financial and operational information systems of target businesses and, where necessary, we enhance and improve those existing systems that are deemed to be inadequate or insufficient to support our business plan for the target business.
Financing
Credit Facility
In April 2018, we entered into the 2018 Credit Facility to amend and restate the 2014 Credit Facility, originally dated as of June 6, 2014. The 2018 Credit Facility provides for (i) revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit up 
15

to a maximum aggregate amount of $600 million (the “2018 Revolving Loan Commitment”), and (ii) a $500 million term loan. 
At December 31, 2018, we had $496.3 million outstanding on the 2018 Term Loan and $228.0 million outstanding on our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. All amounts outstanding under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility will become due on April 18, 2023, which is the maturity date of loans advanced under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and the termination date of the revolving loan commitment. The 2018 Credit Facility also permits us, prior to the applicable maturity date, to increase the revolving loan commitment and/or obtain additional term loans in an aggregate amount of up to $250 million subject to certain restrictions and conditions.
The 2018 Credit Facility provides for letters of credit under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate face amount not to exceed $100 million outstanding at any time, as well as swing line loans of up to $25 million outstanding at one time. At no time may the (i) aggregate principal amount of all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, plus (ii) the aggregate amount of all outstanding letters of credit and swing line loans, exceed the borrowing availability under the 2014 Credit Facility. At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $0.3 million. The borrowing availability under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2018 was approximately $371.7 million.
The 2018 Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets of the Company, including all of its equity interests in, and loans to, its consolidated subsidiaries. (See "Note H - Debt" to the consolidated financial statements for more detail regarding our 2018 Credit Facility).
Senior Notes
On April 18, 2018, we consummated the issuance and sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes offered pursuant to a private offering to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S under the Securities Act. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay debt under our existing credit facilities in connection with a concurrent refinancing transaction described above. The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of April 18, 2018 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes will bear interest at the rate of 8.000% per annum and will mature on May 1, 2026. Interest on the Notes is payable in cash on May 1st and November 1st of each year, beginning on November 1, 2018. The Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are not guaranteed by our subsidiaries. 
We intend to finance future acquisitions through our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, cash on hand and, if necessary, additional equity and debt financings. We believe, and it has been our experience, that having the ability to finance our acquisitions with the capital resources raised by us, rather than negotiating separate third party financing specifically related to the acquisition of individual businesses, provides us with an advantage in acquiring attractive businesses by minimizing delay and closing conditions that are often related to acquisition-specific financings. In this respect, we believe that in the future, we may need to pursue additional debt or equity financings, or offer equity in Holdings or target businesses to the sellers of such target businesses, in order to fund multiple future acquisitions. 
Our Businesses
We categorize the businesses we own into two separate groups of businesses (i) branded consumer businesses, and (ii) niche industrial businesses. Branded consumer businesses are characterized as those businesses that we believe capitalize on a valuable brand name in their respective market sector. We believe that our branded consumer businesses are leaders in their particular product category. Niche industrial businesses are characterized as those businesses that focus on manufacturing and selling particular products and industrial services within a specific market sector. We believe that our niche industrial businesses are leaders in their specific market sector.
The following table represents the percentage of net revenue and operating income each of our businesses contributed to our consolidated results since the date of acquisition for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and the total assets of each of our businesses as a percentage of the consolidated total as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Branded Consumer Businesses
5.11 
Overview
5.11 is a leading provider of purpose-built tactical apparel and gear for law enforcement, firefighters, EMS, and military special operations as well as outdoor and adventure enthusiasts. 5.11 is committed to product innovation, and works directly with end users to create apparel and gear designed to enhance the safety, accuracy, speed and performance of tactical professionals and enthusiasts worldwide. Headquartered in Irvine, California, 5.11 operates sales offices and distribution centers globally. 5.11 products are widely distributed in law enforcement dealers, uniform stores, military exchanges, outdoor retail stores, company owned retail stores and online.
History of 5.11
5.11 was formed in 2003 after spinning out of outdoor apparel company, Royal Robbins®. The roots of 5.11, however, trace back to 1975, when American rock climber Royal Robbins designed the 5.11® Pant; named after the difficulty level in the Yosemite Decimal System rating scale for rock climbing. With difficulty levels ranging at the time from 5.0 (easy) to 5.10 (difficult), 5.11 was then described: “After thorough inspection, you conclude this move is impossible; however, occasionally someone actually accomplishes it.” 
A product designed for people who were pushing the limits of what was possible, the 5.11® Pant was a success among climbers and outdoor enthusiasts. In 1992, the FBI Academy, in Quantico, Virginia adopted the original 5.11® Pant as its primary training pant, forging a decades-long relationship that supports 5.11’s commitment to the public safety and the first responder communities.
In 2011, 5.11’s corporate headquarters was relocated from Modesto, California to Irvine, California. In 2012, 5.11 acquired Beyond Clothing LLC, a technical survival systems outerwear company located in Seattle, Washington. We acquired a majority interest in 5.11 on August 31, 2016.
17

Industry
5.11 participates in the global professional and consumer soft goods market for tactical gear and apparel; the addressable global soft goods market is estimated by management to be approximately $79 billion. 
The domestic professional public safety market for tactical soft goods is estimated by management to be a $1.7 billion market consisting of sales to active-duty military, law enforcement, private security, fire, corrections officers and EMS. The addressable domestic work wear and consumer wear markets are estimated by management to be $4.3 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively. 
The international professional public safety market for tactical soft goods is estimated by management to be a $11.7 billion market. The addressable international work wear and consumer wear markets are estimated by management to be $11.4 billion and $36.3 billion, respectively. 
Products and Services
5.11 offers a portfolio of unique head-to-toe tactical gear with patented functional features for both professional and consumer use. No individual product style accounts for more than 7% of total sales, and most product styles tend to have multi-year lifecycles. 5.11 focuses its product offering through six major categories: tactical apparel, bags and packs, footwear, special make ups/uniforms, accessories, and Beyond Clothing Systems (“Beyond”).
Tactical apparel represents 5.11’s largest product category. Within this category, 5.11 offers a broad assortment of men’s and women’s pants, shorts, shirts, outerwear and base layers. Apparel is offered in a variety of styles and fits intended to enhance comfort and mobility. 5.11 has historically designed and developed innovative “families” of products around proprietary fabrics that the company has created to meet the needs of its unique target market. These product “families” typically start with a pant and then expand into other products. Today, 5.11 offers five distinct pant lines, which anchor five different apparel families: the Defender Flex Pant, the Apex™ Pant, the 5.11 Stryke™ Pant, the Taclite® Pro Pant, and the 5.11® Tactical Pant.
5.11 bags and packs provide reliable, multifunctional storage options designed to excel in a wide range of operational and recreational settings. This category includes backpacks, cases, load-bearing equipment, range bags and duffels. In addition to bags/packs and apparel, 5.11 sells footwear, including boots, low-profile tactical shoes, socks and accessories, as well as special make ups or customized uniforms for public safety agencies. 5.11 also offers a wide selection of accessories including belts, hats, flashlights, gloves, knives, eyewear, watches, patches, slings and holsters.
Beyond, a wholly-owned subsidiary of 5.11, offers technical survival outerwear systems engineered specifically for missions in extreme temperatures. Products are marketed under the Beyond brand name and include base layers and briefs, pullovers, softshell jackets, wind pants, rain pants and jackets made of advanced fabrics. Virtually all Beyond products are manufactured in the United States to comply with the Berry Amendment.
5.11’s core product offerings and suggested average retail prices are listed below:

• | Pants and Shorts (Men’s and Women’s) - $49.99 to $269.99


• | Woven Tops (Men’s and Women’s) - $39.99 to $229.99


• | Outerwear (Men’s and Women’s) - $69.99 to $119.99


• | Footwear (Men’s and Women’s) - $99.99 to $149.99


• | Bags and Packs - $59.99 to $249.99


• | Accessories - $19.99 to $79.99

Competitive Strengths
Leading Brand Recognition and Market Share - 5.11 is a leader in the tactical apparel market. 5.11 enjoys strong brand awareness and affinity in the public safety market given its long history of creating high performance and innovative products for public safety operators. 5.11’s heritage of developing purpose-built clothing and gear for law enforcement, firefighters, EMS, and military special operations has imbued the 5.11 brand with unrivaled authenticity in the tactical apparel and gear markets.
Diverse Customer Base - 5.11 has direct relationships with over 12,500 governmental departments and agencies, and utilizes an established network of over 1,500 dealers in over 90 countries. 5.11 wins a significant amount of 
18

business in the public safety channel through the achievement of “specified” product in thousands of individual contracts with governmental departments and agencies, providing for a broad base of long-term relationships.
Product Breadth and “At-Once” Availability - Requirements of outfitting entire agencies or departments necessitates carrying numerous, often infrequently used, sizes and colors of a given product. These requirements, coupled with “at-once” product fulfillment demands and often poorly capitalized dealer customers carrying low levels of inventory, makes 5.11 the go-to provider of tactical gear and apparel. 5.11’s significant investment in inventory provides a competitive advantage versus its smaller less well capitalized competitors.
Business Strategies
Further Expand into Consumer Market - 5.11 is well-positioned to continue investing in retail locations throughout the United States. 5.11 currently has forty-five company-owned retail locations, and management believes that there are significant opportunities to increase this footprint. 5.11 also sells to many outdoor specialty retailers and management believes there are opportunities to expand sales through increased penetration and improved merchandising.
Continue Penetration of Domestic Professional Channel - 5.11 continues to benefit from the domestic professional public safety market, which provides a stable base of recurring growth. Going forward, 5.11 will continue to grow within the domestic professional public safety channel through (i) continued conversion of institutional contract opportunity pipeline; and (ii) market share gains from continued product innovation and improved merchandising.
International Market Expansion - The international market remains an under-penetrated opportunity for 5.11. 5.11 will continue international sales development through building country-specific sales and operations infrastructure, executing on both near and medium term large foreign government contract opportunities, and expanding consumer awareness of the 5.11 brand.
Customers and Distribution Channels
5.11 services a wide range of customers including first responders, the military, and outdoors enthusiasts in over 90 countries. The primary distribution channels can be segmented into two categories: professional and consumer. 5.11's working capital needs do not differ substantially from those of its competitors in the industry and generally reflect the need to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet the requirements of its customers.
The domestic professional channel is characterized by thousands of unique “specified” product contracts with individual public safety departments, serviced through a network of more than one-thousand local third party dealers. Public safety departments include federal, state, county, city and local law enforcement, firefighters, and EMS. Similar to the domestic professional channel, the international professional channel also consists of many unique “specified” product contracts with individual foreign governmental departments, serviced either directly by 5.11 or through a network of international dealers. Large contracts with government agencies are referred to as Direct-to-Agency (“DTA”). A typical DTA sales process is driven primarily by lengthy governmental approval processes and can take upwards of 18 to 36 months. 
Within the consumer segment, the consumer wholesale channel is comprised of (i) outdoor specialty retailers, (ii) military exchanges, and (iii) online. The consumer direct channel is comprised of (i) e-commerce sales directly through the 5.11 website, www.511tactical.com, and (ii) company-owned retail stores. At the end of 2018, 5.11 operated forty-five company-owned retail locations in twenty-two states. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, professional channel sales accounted for approximately 64% of total sales; approximately 1% of total sales were in the form of DTA sales. The consumer channel accounted for approximately 35% of total sales. 
5.11’s top 10 customers comprised approximately 21%, 26% and 27% of total sales in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Sales and Marketing
5.11’s sales organization consists of a mix of direct employees, independent contractors and sales agencies. The domestic salesforce develops direct relationships with thousands of individual public safety departments around the U.S. and participates in thousands of requests for proposal (RFP) processes annually. The salesforce works directly with over 900 local dealers to service local public safety departments once a 5.11 product receives “spec” as part of the RFP process. 
19

The international salesforce covers three primary regions: Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and Latin America. While the company does fulfill some orders directly to international customers through its 5.11 website, most sales are serviced through third party distributors and dealers in foreign jurisdictions.
5.11 has implemented a multi-pronged marketing plan including investments in (i) professional and consumer product catalogues; (ii) print media; (iii) tradeshows; (iv) shop-in-shop retail concepts; and (v) digital and social media content.
5.11 had a backlog of $17.3 million and $26.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Suppliers
5.11 operates an efficient, low-cost supply chain, sourcing most its products through contract manufacturers in the Asia Pacific region. Production from Vietnam accounted for approximately 35% of 5.11’s purchases for the year ended December 31, 2017 and represented 5.11’s largest sourcing region. No single core product is 100% sourced by any one vendor. Management believes that 5.11’s principal manufacturers have the additional capacity to accommodate future growth.
Production of Beyond products occurs primarily through domestic subcontract facilities in the U.S. and through the brand’s headquarters in Seattle, Washington. 
To ensure vendor reliability and quality, 5.11 established a sourcing office in Hong Kong. The office employs approximately 50 individuals whose primary functions include vendor management, commercialization, product development, production planning, vendor compliance, quality assurance and compliance. 
Intellectual Property 
5.11 relies on brand name recognition and a combination of trademarks and patents in order to differentiate itself from the competition. 5.11 currently has 18 utility patents and 10 design patents issued, in addition to 17 utility and 3 design patents pending registration. 5.11 currently owns 319 registered trademarks including 3 trade dress registrations. The company has in-house general counsel that manages the registration and defense of 5.11 intellectual property.
Regulatory Environment
Management is not aware of any existing, pending, or contingent liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on 5.11’s business. 5.11 is proactive regarding regulatory issues and is in compliance with all relevant regulations. Management is not aware of any potential environmental issues.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, 5.11 employed a total of 629 non-unionized, full-time employees, 47 independent contractors, and 132 temporary workers. None of 5.11’s employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Management believes that 5.11 has an excellent relationship with its employees.
Ergobaby
Overview
Ergobaby is dedicated to building a global community of confident parents with smart, ergonomic solutions that enable and encourage bonding between parents and babies. Ergobaby offers a broad range of award-winning baby carriers, blankets and swaddlers, nursing pillows, and related products that fit into families’ daily lives seamlessly, comfortably and safely.  Ergobaby is headquartered in Los Angeles, California.
History of Ergobaby
Ergobaby was founded in 2003 by Karin Frost, who designed her first baby carrier following the birth of her son. The baby carrier product line has since expanded into 3-position and 4-position carriers, with multiple style variations. In its second year of operations, Ergobaby sold 10,500 baby carriers and today sells over 1 million a year. In order to support the rapid growth, in 2007, Ergobaby made a strategic decision to establish an operating subsidiary (“EBEU”) in Hamburg, Germany. We purchased a majority interest in Ergobaby on September 16, 2010.
On May 12, 2016, Ergobaby acquired membership interests of New Baby Tula LLC (“Baby Tula”) for approximately $73.8 million, excluding a potential earn-out payment. Baby Tula designs, markets and distributes premium baby carriers and accessories and focuses its efforts on both the ergonomics and fashion of its products.
20

In 2013, Ergobaby expanded its portfolio into the sleep category. The launch of the Ergobaby Swaddler which focused on a unique method of swaddling newborns while retaining healthy hip and arm positioning, was the first significant category expansion outside of baby carriers for the Ergobaby brand. In 2016, Ergobaby expanded its offering in the sleep category with the launch of its Baby Sleeping Bag. Baby Tula is also in the sleep category with its blanket offering, focusing on limited edition fashion prints.
In 2014, Ergobaby launched the Ergobaby Four-Position 360 Baby Carrier which expanded on Ergobaby’s leadership in the baby carrier category by offering an ergonomic, outward forward facing position for the baby and comfort for the parent. The Ergobaby 360 Carrier won the 2014 JPMA Innovation award in the baby carrier category. In 2016, Ergobaby launched the 3-Position Adapt Baby Carrier that is geared for newborns to toddlers (7lbs-45lbs) and offers some unique parent comfort features including lumbar support and crossable shoulder straps, as well as the benefit of being an all-in-one carrier with no need for an infant insert accessory (for babies 7-12lbs.). In 2017, Ergobaby launched the All Position, All-in-One Omni 360 Baby Carrier that is geared for newborns to toddlers (7lbs-45lbs) and includes all of Ergobaby’s parent & baby comfort features from the 360 and Adapt Baby Carriers, as well as the same consumer benefit of no infant insert accessory needed. 
In 2018, Ergobaby entered into the stroller category with 2 new models. The first product launched was a full-size option called the 180 Reversible Stroller. This was followed later in the year by a premium compact option, the Metro Compact City Stroller.
Industry
Ergobaby competes in the large and expanding infant and juvenile products industry. The industry exhibits little seasonality and is somewhat insulated from overall economic trends, as parents view spending on children as largely non-discretionary in nature. Consequently, parents spend consistently on their children, particularly on durable items, such as car seats, strollers, baby carriers, and related items that are viewed as necessities. Further, an emotional component is often a factor in parents’ purchasing decisions, as parents’ desire to purchase the best and safest products for their children. As a result, according to the USDA’s most recent report on Expenditures on Children by Families 2013 (August 2014), parents on average, spend between $9,130 and $25,700 on their child on an annual basis for related housing, food, transportation, clothes, healthcare, daycare and other items, depending on age of the child and annual income. The amount spent by parents in the highest income group (before tax income greater than $106,540) was more than twice the amounts spent by parents in the lowest income group (before tax income of less than $61,530). On average, households spent between 14 - 25% of their before-tax income on a child. Similar patterns are seen in other counties around the world.
Demand drivers fueling the growing spending on infant and juvenile products include favorable demographic trends, such as (i) an increasing number of births worldwide; (ii) a high percentage of first time births; (iii) an increasing age of first time mothers and a large percentage of working mothers with increased disposable income; and (iv) an increasing percentage of single child households and two-family households.
In purchases of baby durables, parents often seek well-known and trusted brands that offer a sense of comfort regarding a product’s reliability and safety. As a result, brand name, comfort and safety certifications can serve as a barrier to entry for competition in the market, as well as allow well-known brands such as Ergobaby and Baby Tula to compete in a growing premium segment.
Products and Services
Baby Carriers
Ergobaby has two main baby carrier product lines: baby carriers and related carrier accessories, sold under both the Ergobaby and Tula brands. Ergobaby’s baby carrier designs supports a natural, ergonomic ("M" shaped) sitting position for babies, eliminating compression of the spine and hips that can be caused by unsupported suspension. The baby carrier also distributes the baby’s weight evenly between parents’ hips and shoulders, and alleviates physical stress for the parent. Both Ergobaby’s 3-Position and 4-Position baby carriers have been recognized by the International Hip Dysplasia Institute as being “hip healthy”. Additional accessories are provided to complement the baby carriers including the popular Infant Insert.
Within the Ergobaby Baby Carrier product line, Ergo sells 3-Position and 4-Position baby carriers in a variety of style and color variations and Baby Tula sells 3-Position, Standard, Toddler and Wrap Conversion fashion-oriented baby carriers. Baby Carrier sales were approximately $85.7 million, $96.0 million and $84.0 million in the years ended 
21

December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and represented approximately 89%, 88% and 81%, of total sales in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Within the baby carrier accessories category, the Infant Insert is the largest sales component of the accessory category. Accessory sales were $6.7 million, $8.6 million, and $10.5 million, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and represented approximately 7.0% in 2018, 8.4% in 2017 and 10% in 2016, of total sales.
Ergobaby’s core Baby Carrier product offerings with average retail prices are summarized below:
Ergo

• | 4 styles of baby carriers - $115 - $180


• | 3 styles of Infant Inserts - $25 - $38

Tula 

• | 3 styles of baby carriers - $149 - $900


• | 1 style of Infant Inserts - $40

Competitive Strengths
Ergobaby innovation - Ergobaby Carriers are known for their unsurpassed comfort. Ergobaby’s superior design results in improved comfort for both parent and baby. Parents are comfortable because baby’s weight is evenly distributed between the hips and shoulders while baby sits ergonomically in a natural ("M" shaped) sitting position. The concept of baby carrying has increased in popularity in the U.S. as parents recognize the emotional and functional benefits of carrying their baby. Consumers continually cite the comfort, design, and convenient “hands free” mobility the Ergobaby carrier offers as key purchasing criteria. Ergobaby is also recognized as an industry leader in innovation. With the launch of the Ergo 4-Position 360 Carrier in 2014, the launch of the 3-Position ADAPT carrier in 2016, and the launch of the All Position Omni 360 carrier in 2017, Ergobaby continues to innovate in the baby carrier segment on a regular basis.
Baby Tula Community - Tula enjoys an active and enthusiastic community who are vocal advocates for the brand. The Tula community acts as both an avid source of feedback on new product launches, which influence future product and patterns, as well as brand influencers to the broader new parenting community.
Business Strategies
Increase Penetration of Current U.S. Distribution Channels - Ergobaby continues to benefit from steady expansion of the market for wearable baby carriers and related accessories in the U.S. and internationally. Going forward, Ergobaby will continue to leverage and expand the awareness of its outstanding brands (both Ergobaby and Baby Tula) in order to capture additional market share in the U.S., as parents increasingly recognize the enhanced mobility, convenience, and the ability to remain close to the child that all Ergobaby carriers enable. Ergobaby currently markets its products to consumers in the U.S. through brick-and-mortar retailers, national chain stores; online retailers; and directly through Ergobaby.com and Babytula.com websites. 
International Market Expansion - Testimony to the global strength of its lifestyle brand, Ergobaby has historically derived approximately 60% of its sales from international markets. Like it has in the U.S., Ergobaby can continue to leverage the Ergo and Tula brand equity in the international markets it currently serves to aggressively drive future growth, as well as expand its international presence into new regions. The market for Ergobaby’s products abroad continues to grow rapidly, in part due to the growth in the number of births worldwide and the fact that in many parts of Europe and Asia, the concept of baby wearing is a culturally entrenched form of infant and child transport.
New Product Development - Management believes Ergobaby has an opportunity to leverage its unique, authentic lifestyle brands and expand its product line. Since its founding in 2003, Ergobaby has successfully introduced new carrier products to maintain innovation, uniqueness, and freshness within its baby carrier and travel system product lines and has become the baby carrier industry leader with the launch of the 4-Position 360 baby carrier. In addition to expanding into new product carriers like swaddling and nursing pillows, in 2018, Ergobaby entered the stroller category by introducing a new premium compact stroller (Metro Compact City Stroller) and a full-size stroller (180 Reversible Stroller).

Customers and Distribution Channels
Ergobaby primarily sells its products through brick-and-mortar retailers, national chain stores, online retailers and distributors. In Europe, Ergobaby products are sold through its German based subsidiary, which services brick-and-mortar retailers and online retailers in Germany and France; it’s United Kingdom based subsidiary; and its Tula subsidiary in Poland; as well as a network of distributors located in Finland, Russia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Spain, Denmark, Italy, Turkey and the Ukraine. Customers in Canada are predominately serviced by Ergobaby’s Canadian subsidiary. Sales to customers outside of the U.S. and European markets are predominantly serviced through distributors granted rights, though not necessarily exclusive, to sell within a specific geographic region.
Sales and Marketing
Within the U.S., Ergobaby directly employs sales professionals and utilizes independent sales representatives assigned to differing U.S. territories managed by in-house sales professionals. Independent salespeople in the U.S. are paid on a commission basis based on customer type and sales territory. In Europe, Ergobaby directly employs its salespeople and salespeople are paid a base salary and a commission on their sales, which is standard in that territory.
Ergobaby has implemented a multi-faceted marketing plan which includes (i) online marketing efforts, including online advertisement, search engine optimization and social networking efforts; (ii) increasing tradeshow attendance at consumer and medical professional shows; and (iii) increasing promotional activities.
Ergobaby had approximately $11.9 million and $9.2 million in firm backlog orders at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Competition
The infant and juvenile products market is fragmented, with a few larger manufacturers and marketers with portfolios of brands and a multitude of smaller, private companies with relatively targeted product offerings.
Within the infant and juvenile products market, Ergobaby’s baby carriers primarily compete with companies that market wearable baby carriers. Within the wearable baby carrier market, several distinct segments exist, including (i) slings and wraps; (ii) soft-structured baby carriers; and (iii) hard frame baby carriers.
The primary global competitors in this segment are BabyBjorn, Chicco, Britax and Manduca, which also market products in the premium price range. Especially in the U.S., Ergobaby brands also compete with several smaller companies that have developed wearable carriers, such as Infantino, Boba, and Lillebaby. Within the soft-structured baby carrier segment, Ergobaby benefits from strong distribution, good word of mouth, and the functionality of the design.
Suppliers
During 2018, Ergobaby sourced its Ergo carrier and carrier accessory products from Vietnam and India, and manufactured its stroller systems and accessory products in China.  Baby Tula products predominantly were produced from factories in India and Poland and were also produced in its own facility located in Poland.  In 2012, Ergobaby began sourcing carriers and accessories from a manufacturing facility in Vietnam and in 2009, Ergobaby partnered with a manufacturer located in India.  More than 50% of Ergobaby’s carriers and accessories came from Vietnam in 2018. Baby Tula sourced its carrier, accessories and blanket products from Poland, Vietnam and India, with purchases from these locations accounted for approximately 11% of total Ergobaby purchases.  Management believes its manufacturing partners have the additional capacity to accommodate Ergobaby’s projected growth.
Intellectual Property
Ergobaby maintains and defends a U.S. and international patent portfolio on some of its various products, including its 3-position and 4-position carriers.  Currently, it has 24 patents (including allowances) and 17 patents pending in the U.S. and other countries. Ergobaby also depends on brand name recognition and premium product offering to differentiate itself from competition.
Regulatory Environment
Management is not aware of any existing, pending, or contingent liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on Ergobaby’s business. Ergobaby is proactive regarding regulatory issues and is in compliance with all relevant regulations. Ergobaby maintains adequate product liability insurance coverage and to date has not incurred any losses. Management is not aware of any potential environmental issues.
23

Employees
As of December 31, 2018, Ergobaby employed 171 persons in 6 locations. None of Ergobaby’s employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that Ergobaby’s relationship with its employees is good.
Liberty Safe
Overview
Liberty Safe, headquartered in Payson, Utah and founded in 1988, is the premier designer, manufacturer, and marketer of home, gun and office safes in North America. From its over 300,000 square foot manufacturing facility, Liberty Safe produces a wide range of home, office and gun safe models in a broad assortment of sizes, features and styles ranging from an entry level product to good, better and best products. Products are marketed under the Liberty Safe brand, as well as a portfolio of licensed and private label brands, including Cabela’s, Case IH, and John Deere. Liberty Safe’s products are the market share leader and are sold through an independent dealer network (“Dealer sales”) in addition to various sporting goods, farm and fleet, and home improvement retail outlets (“Non-Dealer sales” or “National sales”). Liberty Safe has the largest independent dealer network in the industry, with more than 50% of Liberty's sales in the last two years coming from the dealer network.
History of Liberty Safe
The Liberty Safe brand and its leading market share has been built over a 30-year history of superior product quality, engineering and design innovation, and leading customer service and sales support. Liberty Safe has a long history of continuous improvement and innovative approaches to sales and marketing, product development and manufacturing processes. Significant investments over the last five years have solidified Liberty Safe’s reputation for providing substantial value to retailers and enhanced its long-standing position as the leading producer of premium home, office and gun safes.
Liberty Safe commenced operations in 1988 and in 2001 opened its current state-of-the-art facility in Payson, Utah. The new facility allowed Liberty Safe to consolidate all of its manufacturing and distribution operations to a centralized location. As the only facility in the industry utilizing significant automation and a streamlined roll-form manufacturing process, it represented a significant step forward when compared to the production capabilities of its competitors. Incremental investments following the consolidation have solidified Liberty Safe’s position as the preeminent low-cost and most efficient domestic manufacturer.
During 2011, Liberty Safe constructed a new production line that allowed Liberty to build entry level safe products in-house. This production line produces home and gun safe models that were previously completely sourced through foreign manufacturers. This investment in production capacity makes Liberty Safe one of the largest manufacturer of home, office and gun safes in the world. This added investment in capacity in the U.S. allowed Liberty Safe to provide shorter lead times and more competitive pricing to its North American customer base. 
We purchased a majority interest in Liberty Safe on March 31, 2010.
Industry
Liberty Safe competes in the broadly defined North American safe and vault industry which includes fire and document safes, media and data safes, depository safes, gun safes and cabinets, home safes and hotel safes. According to Technavio's 2016 global safes and vaults market report, the global safe market was estimated to be approximately $2.9 billion in 2015, and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.5% through 2020. Gun safes and vaults comprise approximately 16.5% of the global safe market and it is expected that percentage will remain consistent through 2020. Domestically, demand for safes depends on several key factors, including per capita disposable income since safes are largely considered a discretionary purchase in most households. The gun safe segment of the industry typically sees demand that closely correlates to the demand from guns and ammunition manufacturers. When gun sales increase, the potential market for gun safes typically also increases. Increased fears surrounding violence in the country along with political uncertainty concerning gun ownership laws play a part in changes in gun ownership and subsequently, demand for gun safes. The profitability of individual companies depends on efficient operations and effective marketing, with large companies able to take advantage of economies of scale in production and distribution, while smaller companies compete through specialty products. 
The domestic safe industry continues to see increased competition from imports, particularly those sourced from China. Imported safes were expected to comprise approximately one-third of the domestic sales in 2018, with competition 
24

from imports highest in the small safe product group, which are targeted at households. Imported safes compete on price, with foreign manufacturers passing along savings from operational efficiencies, lower cost labor and raw materials to the end consumer. The competition from imported safes may make it harder to pass increasing costs, including the cost of steel, to the end consumer. 
Products and Services
Liberty Safe offers home, office and gun safes with retail prices ranging from $400 to $8,000. Liberty Safe produces 32 home and gun safe models with the most varied assortment of sizes, feature upgrades, accessories and styling options in the industry. Liberty Safe’s premium home and gun safe product line covers sizes from 12 cu. ft. to 50 cu. ft. with smaller sizes available for its personal home safe. Liberty Safe markets its products under Company-owned brands and a portfolio of licensed and private label brands, including Cabela’s, Case IH, Colt and John Deere. Liberty Safe also sells commercial safes, vault doors, handgun vaults, and a number of accessories and options. The overwhelming majority of revenue is derived from the sales of safes.
Competitive Strengths
#1 Premium Home and Gun Safe Brand with Strong Momentum in the Market - Liberty Safe achieved the status of #1 selling safe company in America in 1994 (per statistics provided by Sargent & Greenleaf, the primary lock supplier to the industry) and maintains this prominent position today. Liberty Safe continues to gain market share from the various smaller participants who lack the distribution and sales and marketing capabilities of Liberty Safe. 
State-of-the-Art and Scalable Operations - Liberty's management has constructed a highly scalable operational platform and infrastructure that has positioned Liberty Safe for substantial sales growth and enhanced profitability in the coming years. Liberty Safe transitioned itself from a manufacturing oriented operating culture to a demand-based, sales-oriented organization. Its strategic transition required the implementation of a demand-based sales and operating platform, which included (i) new equipment to drive automation and capacity improvements; (ii) re-engineered product lines and production processes to drive efficiency through greater standardization in production; and (iii) new employee incentives tied to labor efficiency, which has improved worker performance as well as employee attitude. These initiatives are enhanced by an experienced senior executive team, a balanced sourcing and in-house manufacturing production strategy, advanced distribution capabilities and sophisticated IT systems. Liberty has combined its demand-based sales and operating initiatives with upgraded production equipment to drive multiple operational improvements. These initiatives combined with Liberty’s cumulative historical investments in operational capabilities have created a lasting competitive advantage over its smaller competitors, who utilize labor-intensive operations and lack the company’s lean manufacturing culture. For the past seventeen years, Liberty Safe has leased a manufacturing and distribution facility in Payson, Utah that management believes represents the most scalable domestic facility in the industry. Liberty Safe’s multi-faceted production capabilities allow for substantial flexibility and scalable capacity, thus assuring a level of supply chain execution far superior to any of its competitors.
Historically, Liberty Safe maintained an optimal mix of in-house and Asian-sourced manufacturing in order to improve its ability to meet customer inventory needs. Beginning in 2012, Liberty Safe began manufacturing entry level safes that were previously completely sourced from an Asian manufacturer, on its new production line. In 2018, only 4% of safes (excluding handgun safes) sold by Liberty were sourced in Asia.
Reputation for High Quality Products - Liberty Safe offers only the highest quality products on a consistent basis, which over the years has gained it an enviable reputation and a key point of differentiation from its competitors. Liberty Safe distinguishes its products through tested security and fire protection features and industry leading design focused on functionality and aesthetics. The design of its safes meet rigorous internal benchmarks for security and fire protection, with most receiving certification from Underwriters Laboratory, Inc. (“UL”), the leading product safety standard certification, for its security capabilities. Additionally, Liberty Safe’s investment in accessories and feature options have made Liberty safes the most visually appealing and functional in the industry, while providing more customized solutions for retailers and consumers. 
Trusted Supplier to National Retailer and Dealer Accounts - Liberty Safe’s comprehensive, high-quality product offering and sophisticated sales and marketing programs have made it a critical supplier to a diverse group of national accounts and dealers. Initially a key supplier primarily to the dealer channel, it has expanded its business with national accounts, such as Cabela’s and John Deere. Liberty Safe provides a superior value proposition as a supplier for its national retailers and dealers via its well-recognized brands, lifetime product warranty, tailored merchandising, category management solutions and superior supply chain execution. Further, Liberty Safe’s products generate more profitable floor-space, with both high absolute gross profit and retail margins over 30%. High retail profitability plus increased inventory turns has entrenched Liberty Safe as a key partner in customers’ success in the safe category. As a core 
25

element of building its relationships, Liberty Safe has invested significantly in making its retailers better salespeople through a proprietary suite of training tools, including in-store training, new product demonstrations, online education programs and sales strategy literature.
Business Strategies
Liberty Safe has experienced strong historical growth while executing on multiple new sales and operational initiatives, positioning it to continue to increase its scale and improve profitability. Liberty’s growth strategy is rooted in the sales and marketing and operational initiatives that have spurred its expansion into new accounts and increased penetration of existing accounts. Liberty has significant opportunity in its existing channels to continue to build upon its already strong market share. In addition to growth within its current channels, Liberty’s core competencies can be successfully applied to ventures in the broader security equipment market. Liberty has explored certain of these opportunities, but due to the prioritization of operational initiatives and expansion opportunities within existing channels, they have not been aggressively pursued. Potential near-to-medium term areas for expansion of Liberty’s platform include:

• | Expand Liberty’s product line into the broader home and office safe market through current customers or new distribution strategies;


• | Further develop international distribution by entering new countries and expanding current limited presence in Canada, Mexico and Europe;


• | Enter the residential security market through a strategic partnership with a provider of residential security service solutions to provide a more complete physical and electronic security solution;


• | Acquire businesses within the premium home and gun safe industry and/or leverage Liberty’s platform into new products or channels; and


• | Offer additional accessory products to existing distribution networks.

Research and Development
Liberty Safe is the engineering and design leader in its sector, due to a history of first-to-market features and standard-setting design improvements. Liberty’s proactive solicitation of feedback and constant interaction with consumers and retail customers across diverse channels and geographies enables Liberty Safe to stay at the forefront of customer demands. Liberty’s approach to product development increases the likelihood of market acceptance by creating products that are more relevant to consumers’ demands. Research and development costs were $0.2 million in 2018, $0.5 million in 2017, and $0.3 million in 2016.
In addition to product enhancements, new products, such as the plate-door National Security Classic, and a new, 6-SKU line of handgun vaults were launched in 2015 from Liberty’s commitment to R&D. In 2016, Liberty introduced a new 3-section “Extreme” interior design, new safe covers, new handgun vault designs, and several new safe sizes.  In 2018, Liberty introduced a new flat pin design (patent pending) in all of its large safes.  This new design provides a much higher level of security against pry-attacks. 
Customers and Distribution Channels
Liberty Safe has fostered long-term relationships with leading national retailers (National or Non-Dealer) as well as numerous Dealers, enabling Liberty Safe to achieve considerable brand awareness and channel exposure. Through significant investment in its national accounts sales and marketing efforts, Liberty Safe has also become a leading supplier to National accounts. Expansion into National accounts is part of Liberty Safe’s strategy to reach a broader customer base and more varied demographics. National account customers include sporting goods retailers, farm and fleet retailers, and home improvement retailers. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, Liberty Safe had 20, 16 and 13 Non-Dealer account customers, respectively, that are estimated to have accounted for approximately 40%, 46% and 50% of net sales, respectively.
Dealer customers include local hunting and fishing stores, hardware stores and numerous other local, independent store models. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, there were 405, 406 and 392 Dealers that accounted for 60%, 54% and 50% of net sales, respectively.
Liberty Safe’s two largest customers accounted for approximately 29.5%, 32.6% and 36.5% of net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Seasonality
Liberty Safe typically experiences its lowest earnings in the second quarter due to lower demand for safes at the onset of summer.
26

Sales and Marketing
Liberty Safe possesses robust sales and marketing capabilities in the safe industry. Liberty Safe utilizes separate sales teams for National accounts and Dealers, which enables it to provide more focused and effective strategies to manage and develop relationships within different channels. Liberty Safe has made significant recent investments in the development of a comprehensive sales and marketing program including merchandising, sales training and tools, promotions and supply chain management. Through these various initiatives, Liberty Safe offers highly adaptable programs to suit the varying needs of its retailers. This has enabled Liberty Safe to become a key supplier across diverse channels. Liberty Safe began advertising nationally on the Glenn Beck radio show in the second half of 2010. This advertising has been highly successful and Liberty has continued this advertising in each of the following years and intends on continuing this advertisement in the future. 
Liberty Safe’s comprehensive service offering makes it uniquely suited to service national retailers in a variety of channels. Liberty Safe has designed a Store-within-a-Store program and a more comprehensive Safe Category Management program to build relationships and increase its importance to retailers. Primarily utilized with sporting goods retailers, the Store-within-a-Store concept successfully integrates the effective sales strategies of its dealers for selling a high-price point, niche product into a larger store format. Centered on communicating the benefits of its products to customers, the program enables retailers to more effectively up-sell customers through a good-better-best merchandising platform, increasing margin and inventory turns for its retailers. Liberty’s Safe Category Management program builds on the Store-within-a-Store concept to provide greater sales and marketing control and more complete inventory management solutions. This program facilitates Liberty Safe becoming the sole supplier to retailers, providing large incremental expansion and stronger relationships at accounts. No other market participant has the capabilities to provide a comprehensive suite of customer service solutions to national retailers, such as customized SKU programs, a Store-within-a-Store program and a Safe Category Management program. 
Competition
Liberty Safe is the premier brand in the premium home and gun safe industry, with an estimated 34% market share in the category. Liberty is in a class by itself when it comes to manufacturing technology and efficiency and supply chain capabilities. Competitors are generally more heavily focused on either smaller, sourced safes or large, domestically produced safes. Competitive domestic manufacturers run “blacksmith” type factories that are small, inefficient and require a tremendous amount of manual labor that produces inconsistent product. In addition, many of Liberty’s competitors are directly tied to a third-party brand, such as Browning or Winchester.
Liberty competes with other safe manufacturers based on price, breadth of product line, technology, product supply chain capabilities and marketing capabilities.
Channel diversity in the premium home and gun safe industry is rare, with most companies having greater concentration in either the dealer channel or national accounts, but rarely having the supply chain capabilities or sales and marketing programs to service both channels effectively such as Liberty Safe does. Major competitors have limited sales and marketing departments and programs, making it difficult for them to expand sales and gain market share.
Suppliers
Liberty’s primary raw materials are steel, sheetrock, wood, locks, handles and fabric, for which it receives multiple shipments per week. Materials, on average, account for approximately 60% of the total cost of a safe, with steel accounting for approximately 45% of material costs. Liberty purchases its materials from a combination of domestic and foreign suppliers. Historically, Liberty Safe has been able to pass on raw material price increases to its customers.
Liberty purchased approximately 18 million pounds of steel in 2018 primarily from domestic suppliers, using contracts that lock in prices two fiscal quarters in advance. Liberty Safe purchases coiled and flat steel in gauges from four to fourteen. Liberty Safe specifies rigorous requirements related to surface and edge finish and grain direction. All steel products are checked to ASTM specification and dimensional tolerances before entering the production process.
Liberty Safe had approximately $6.0 million and $6.2 million in firm backlog orders at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Intellectual Property
Liberty Safe relies upon a combination of patents and trademarks in order to secure and protect its intellectual property rights. Liberty Safe currently owns 32 trademarks and 4 patents on proprietary technologies for safe products.
27

Regulatory Environment
Liberty Safe's management believes that Liberty Safe is in compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Liberty Safe has recently moved to a powder paint application in order to reduce hazardous VOC emissions.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, Liberty Safe had 344 full-time employees and 6 temporary employees. Liberty’s labor force is non-union. Management believes that Liberty Safe has an excellent relationship with its employees.
Manitoba Harvest
Overview
Headquartered in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Manitoba Harvest is a pioneer and leader in branded, hemp-based foods. Manitoba Harvest’s products, which Management believes are among the fastest growing in the natural foods industry, are currently carried in approximately 16,500 retail stores across the United States and Canada. Manitoba Harvest’s hemp-based, all-natural product lineup includes hemp hearts, protein powder, hemp oil, hemp milk substitute, and snacks. As the world’s largest vertically-integrated hemp food manufacturer, Manitoba Harvest is involved in every aspect of the hemp production process, from “seed-to-shelf.” All of Manitoba Harvest’s products are an excellent source of plant-based protein and essential fatty acids, including omega-3, gamma-linolenic acid and stearidonic acid. The hemp-based food market is rapidly growing as consumers become aware of the unique combination of great taste and nutritional benefits of hemp-based foods. 
We purchased a majority interest in Manitoba Harvest on July 10, 2015, and we sold Manitoba Harvest subsequent to year-end in the first quarter of 2019. 
History of Manitoba Harvest
Founded in 1998 following the legalization of industrial hemp production in Canada, Manitoba Harvest has been the industry leader in the manufacture of the highest quality hemp food products while educating people on the benefits of hemp nutrition. Manitoba Harvest initially sold the company’s raw hemp seed and oil products in natural food stores with distribution and marketing efforts focused on promotion of consumer acceptance of hemp seeds as a food product. In 2001, Manitoba Harvest began selling their products at Whole Foods and Loblaws, one of Canada’s largest supermarket chains, which allowed for expansion beyond natural food stores. As hemp food products continued to gain mainstream acceptance, Manitoba Harvest launched additional hemp-based products, including a hemp protein powder line, a hemp smoothie line and hemp-based snacks. Manitoba Harvest’s facility in Winnipeg achieved organic certification in 2004 and non-GMO verification in 2009. Manitoba Harvest has the highest level of global certification in food safety and quality and is the first and only hemp-based food company to achieve British Retail Consortium Global Food Safety Initiative (“BRC”) AA+ certification. Leveraging its proven innovation capabilities and position as an industry leader, Manitoba Harvest is currently introducing new product formats with broad appeal, and expanding its presence in retail channels, particularly grocery channels and e-commerce, to capitalize on strong demand from existing customers and to broaden its appeal to reach mainstream consumers. 
On December 15, 2015, Manitoba Harvest acquired all the outstanding stock of Hemp Oil Canada Inc. (“HOCI”). HOCI is a wholesale supplier and a private label packager of hemp food products and ingredients. With the acquisition of HOCI, Manitoba Harvest has added a leading manufacturer and supplier of hemp food products and ingredients for a global customer base.
Industry
Hemp is the distinct oilseed and fiber varieties of the plant species Cannabis sativa L., a tall fibrous plant that has been cultivated worldwide for more than 10,000 years. The hemp crop was introduced to North American in the early 1600s, and it played an integral part in North America’s early history as it was used as a material for various products including riggings and sails on naval ships, paper and fuel oil. Hemp is versatile, with diverse uses from food products to clothing, building materials, fuel and various other applications. As a food product, hemp is packed with essential nutrients such as protein, healthy fats, fiber, magnesium and all 10 essential amino acids. 
As a crop, hemp is a low impact and environmentally sustainable resource that can be grown without pesticides or agricultural chemicals. Hemp is beneficial to the agricultural supply chain, aiding in weed suppression and soil building, making it a favored rotation crop. Hemp comes from the Cannabis sativa L. subspecies sativa, which is a different 
28

subspecies from that grown to produce marijuana, subspecies indica. Hemp contains 0.001% Tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Although it is completely legal to further process and consume hemp-based food products in the U.S., until recently there have been legal restrictions against cultivation of hemp or the processing of live seeds. As a result, U.S. marketers of hemp-based products were required to import essentially all of the hemp seed, oil and fiber that they need. However, the regulatory environment in the U.S. is slowly changing. The U.S. Agriculture Act of 2014 defined industrial hemp as distinct from marijuana and authorized institutions of higher learning and state agriculture departments to grow industrial hemp for research and agricultural pilot programs, leading to certain states that have legalized hemp cultivation and have begun to authorize farmers to plant and grow hemp for experimental purposes. Further, the U.S. Farm Bill passed December 2018 fully legalized the cultivation and sale of industrial hemp at the federal level, effective January 1, 2019.
In Canada, the commercial cultivation of hemp was authorized in 1998 with the implementation of the Canadian Industrial Hemp Regulations, which governs the cultivation, processing, transportation, sale, import and export of industrial hemp. Since its legalization, hemp has garnered significant interest among Canadian farmers and the Canadian government has supported the industry through market development funding and a favorable regulatory environment. The Canadian agricultural industry views hemp as a valuable alternative crop that complements prairie crop production rotations and offers significant economic opportunity due to its numerous end uses.
Hemp-based foods are considered a superfood that are rich in healthy fats and other important minerals; furthermore, hemp seeds are an excellent dietary source of easily digestible plant-based protein. The unique nutritional profile of hemp foods appeals to a broad base of modern diet trends, ranging from paleo to vegetarian diets. Manitoba Harvest broadly competes in the Nuts & Seeds and Protein Powder categories, which Nielsen estimates to be $4.4 billion and $540 million at retail, respectively. The QYR Food and Beverages Research Center estimated hemp-based food and personal care revenue for the United States and Canada at just under USD $372 million in 2017.
Products
Manitoba Harvest is a global leader in branded, hemp-based foods. The company’s products are the fastest growing products in the hemp food market and among the fastest growing in the entire natural foods industry.

Competitive Strengths
Leading Brand Recognition & Market Share - Manitoba Harvest is an award-winning pioneer and global leader in branded, hemp-based foods. Consumer awareness of hemp-based foods and the Manitoba Harvest brand continues to grow rapidly. Manitoba Harvest has developed considerable brand equity with a growing, highly-loyal, and very passionate consumer following. Management believes that Manitoba Harvest holds more than 50% of the market share of hemp heart seed sales and hemp protein powder sales in North America.
Strong Core Consumer Base - Manitoba Harvest’s core consumers are those who generally prefer all-natural products and focus on practicing a lifestyle of health and sustainability. Among its core consumer base, hemp-based foods have a high level of awareness and Manitoba Harvest possesses a high level of brand recognition among this consumer segment. Consumers tend to be extremely loyal after incorporating Manitoba Harvest’s hemp foods into their lifestyle. Consumers develop a bond with the Manitoba Harvest brand and appreciate that Manitoba Harvest seeks to positively impact the community and the environment with its actions. Manitoba Harvest is committed to having a material positive impact on society and the environment. The company takes this commitment very seriously, and communicates this to consumers, in part, by maintaining certification as a registered “B-Corporation”. Through its actions, Manitoba Harvest inspires consumers to “live the brand” and lead happier and healthier lives.
Vertically-Integrated Supply Chain with Long-Term Relationships with Suppliers - Manitoba Harvest enjoys strong relationships with hemp producers, some dating back to their inception in 1998. Manitoba Harvest has a rigorous qualification process for its suppliers which includes an ongoing supplier scorecard and chooses to purchase hemp seeds from only the highest quality growers. With limited exception, farmers working with Manitoba Harvest are exclusive to them. In North America, hemp is only grown commercially in Canada and Manitoba Harvest accounts for more than 60% of the hemp supply, minimizing risk and ensuring quality hemp seeds for their product. The majority of Canada’s hemp supply outside of Manitoba Harvest’s business goes into ingredient and wholesale markets, making Manitoba Harvest the only vertically-integrated, branded hemp-based food company in North America. 
Business Strategies
Manitoba Harvest’s management believes it is well positioned for continued topline growth. As consumer awareness of and demand for hemp-based foods increases, Manitoba Harvest will continue to leverage its market leadership and strong brand awareness to grow through existing customers, broadened distribution, new product launches, and expanded ingredients business. 
Increasing consumer awareness - Manitoba Harvest was founded with the mission to educate consumers on the health and environmental benefits of hemp-based food products and is working to drive awareness with consumers on multiple fronts. Manitoba Harvest is driving consumer awareness through media outreach, a growing social media community, digital media and network of brand ambassadors.  Manitoba Harvest is increasing its investment in digital media, coupons, in-store displays, and product demos at key retailers in the United States and Canada.  Educating shoppers in the U.S., many of whom are unaware of the benefits of hemp foods, will continue to drive sales among shoppers and build relationships at accounts.  Manitoba Harvest is also a co-sponsor of Hemp History Week, an annual event that features hundreds of product demos and promotional events at major retailers throughout the U.S., including Whole Foods Market.
Continued growth with existing customers - Manitoba Harvest expects to grow same store sales with existing customers by expanding the presence of their products on the shelf throughout stores through the introduction of new formats, improved retail product placement and increased investment in merchandising. 
Expansion into new customers - Management believes it has significant opportunity to enter new grocery customers in the mainstream grocery channel, both in Canada and the United States. The grocery channels in both the United States and Canada have experienced significant sales growth in all-natural and organic product categories while sales in traditional product categories have been flat or decreased. Manitoba Harvest continues to invest in its sales capabilities to improve access and engagement with key retail accounts in order to capitalize on consumer demand for healthy eating.
Continued innovation and new product development - In 2018, the company introduced a new line of plant protein blends under the newly created HempYeah! Brand. In addition, all hemp protein powders were renovated under the HempYeah! Brand with clearer consumer positing and updated packaging. Management plans to continue to innovate on existing product lines through new formats and flavors as well as continued development of new product categories to broaden customer appeal and increase the number of hemp food usage occasions.
30

Expanded ingredient business - With the acquisition of HOCI in 2015, Manitoba Harvest added a leading manufacturer and supplier of hemp food products and ingredients. As hemp-based food usage continues to become more widely adopted, management believes the strategic acquisition of HOCI has positioned the company to capitalize on the growing opportunity to be the ingredient supplier of choice to other leading food manufacturers in complementary food product categories. 
Research and Development
Manitoba Harvest competes in the natural products industry, which is characterized by research and development and which yields food product innovations that contribute to human wellness and sustainable development.   The scope of research and development is focused on new product development, product enhancement, process design and improvement, packaging, and meeting the needs of the expanding international business.  Additionally, management utilizes analytics to manage the evolution of its relationships with its customers, and conducts consumer research during early stages of new product development initiatives in order to identify key success factors. Manitoba Harvest spent approximately $0.6 million, $0.7 million and $0.3 million, respectively, on research and development in 2018, 2017, and 2016. In 2018, hemp seeds, oils and protein powders received GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) status from the FDA.
Customers and Distributions Channels
Manitoba Harvest sells its products through four primary retail channels: natural foods, club, conventional grocery, and e-commerce. After initially establishing the authenticity of its brand and products in the natural channel at retailers such as Whole Foods Markets and Sprouts, Manitoba Harvest expanded into the club and grocery channel, initially in Canada, and then in the United States and internationally. In addition, the company sells their hemp food products and ingredients to value-added manufacturers to be used in hemp cereals, hemp milk, nutrition and protein bars and powders, baked goods, and salad dressings.
Manitoba Harvest's three largest customers accounted for approximately 40% of total sales in 2018, 36% of total sales in 2017, and approximately 47% of total sales during 2016. In 2018, approximately 69% of Manitoba Harvest's gross sales were to customers in the United States and approximately 28% were to customers in Canada. The remaining 3% were primarily to customers in a broad range of international locations. In 2017, approximately 57% of Manitoba Harvest's gross sales were to customers in the United Sates and approximately 38% of gross sales were to customers within Canada. The remaining 5% were primarily to customers in a broad range of international locations.
Sales and Marketing
Manitoba Harvest grows sales within existing retail partners by educating and engaging potential consumers through in-store demos, consumer events and sampling.
In addition to partnering with national natural food channel brokers, Manitoba Harvest’s sales organization consists of sales professionals with direct sales coverage of over 1,000 retail locations. The sales force is led by the Senior Vice President of Sales and consists of sales managers, territory managers and brand ambassadors dedicated to specific regions in Canada and the United States. Manitoba Harvest’s sales force is focused on the natural, club and grocery channels, through direct key account coverage and winning sales through a focus on data for category and customer management. In addition to direct sales, the company uses a network of distributors to service many of its customers. 
Manitoba Harvest focuses the majority of sales spending in three key areas: demonstrations/sampling, fixed trade spending and promotions. Successful product demonstrations within the club and grocery channels have helped drive increased sales productivity. Manitoba Harvest utilizes fixed trade spending to secure end-cap positions, ad space and off-shelf displays at various retailers. Additionally, they strategically utilize promotions to position its products in prime display space at retailers. 
Competition
The emerging hemp foods category has a limited number of participants that offer a minimal number of hemp-based products while focusing on a broader assortment of food items. While increasing, competition remains limited due to restricted raw hemp seed access in the United States. Manitoba Harvest’s strong supplier relationships, regulated access to hemp seeds and deep knowledge of the growing and harvesting of hemp afford the company with a unique competitive advantage. 
31

Manitoba Harvest has the highest level of global certification in food safety and quality and is the first and only hemp-based food company to achieve British Retail Consortium (“BRC”) AA+ Global Food Safety Initiative certification. 
Suppliers
Manitoba Harvest is strategically located near their supply of hemp in Canada. The commercial cultivation of hemp was authorized in Canada in 1998 with the implementation of the Canadian Industrial Hemp Regulations. This governs the cultivation, processing, transportation, sale, import and export of industrial hemp. Industrial hemp is viewed by the Canadian and agricultural industry as a valuable new alternative crop that complements crop production rotations and offers significant economic opportunity through numerous end uses. The prairie provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta have emerged as a leading region for growing hemp due to the ideal agricultural characteristics: a long growing season, sufficient moisture levels, and supportive local governments that view hemp as a strategic crop. The adaptability of hemp makes it ideal for areas of the provinces that have limited cropping options and where high value crops such as edible beans and sunflowers are considered high risk. 
Based on its proximity to many of its growers, Manitoba Harvest has developed long-standing relationships with hemp suppliers and currently maintains relationships that provide access to over 60% of the hemp acreage in Canada. Manitoba Harvest has a rigorous qualification process for its suppliers - maintaining an ongoing supplier scorecard and choosing to purchase hemp from high quality growers. With limited exception, farmers working with Manitoba Harvest are exclusive to them. Manitoba Harvest works with approximately 130 conventional and organic hemp growers in Western Canada and the province of Quebec, and 5 hemp seed cleaners. As early leaders of the hemp legalization movement, Manitoba Harvest’s founders have developed in-house expertise on the plant, which they share with their hemp grower partners to help them achieve optimal yield and quality harvests. 
Manitoba Harvest processes 100% of its Hemp Hearts, hemp oil and protein powder at its dedicated hemp food products manufacturing facilities. Manitoba Harvest has leveraged nearly two decades of hemp food manufacturing expertise and has worked with research scientists to develop proprietary processing technology that is specific to hemp. Their two hemp manufacturing facilities in the province of Manitoba can produce up to 65 million pounds of hemp seed annually. The Winnipeg facility is 25,700 square feet and the St. Agathe facility is 37,000 square feet.
Intellectual Property
Manitoba Harvest relies on brand name recognition and premium natural and organic offerings in the hemp food market to differentiate itself from the competition. Manitoba Harvest holds several trademark registrations in multiple jurisdictions, primarily the United States and Canada. 
Regulatory Environment
Management is not aware of any existing, pending or contingent liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on Manitoba Harvest’s business. Manitoba Harvest is proactive regarding regulatory issues and is in compliance with all relevant regulations. Management is not aware of any potential environmental issues.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, Manitoba Harvest employed approximately 157 persons. None of Manitoba Harvest's employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Manitoba Harvest believes its relationship with its employees is good.
Velocity Outdoor
Overview
Velocity Outdoor, headquartered in Bloomfield, New York, is a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of airguns, archery products, laser aiming devices and related accessories. We acquired a majority interest in Velocity Outdoor for a net purchase price of $150.4 million in June 2017. Velocity Outdoor offers its products under the highly recognizable Crosman, Benjamin, LaserMax, Ravin and CenterPoint brands that are available through national retail chains, mass merchants, dealer and distributor networks. Airguns historically represent Velocity Outdoor's largest product category. The airgun product category consists of air rifles, air pistols and a range of accessories including targets, holsters and cases. Velocity Outdoor's other primary product categories are archery, with products including CenterPoint crossbows and the Pioneer Airbow, consumables, which includes steel and plastic BBs, lead pellets and CO2 cartridges, lasers for firearms, and airsoft products. In September 2018, Velocity acquired Ravin Crossbows, a manufacturer and 
32

innovator of crossbows and accessories. Ravin primarily focuses on the higher-end segment of the crossbow market and has developed significant intellectual property related to the advancement of crossbow technology. 
History of Velocity Outdoor
Velocity was founded in 1923 as Crosman Rifle Company and was one of the first manufacturers of recreational airguns in the United States. Velocity Outdoor acquired Visible Impact Target Company in 1991 and Benjamin Sheridan Corporation in 1992. Benjamin was, and continues to be, a dominant U.S. producer of high-end pneumatic and CO2 powered airguns while Sheridan was one of the world’s foremost manufacturers of high quality paintball markers. In 2007, Velocity expanded its offerings outside the traditional airgun category with the debut of its new optics division, CenterPoint Precision Optics. In 2008, Velocity diversified further by adding Crosman Archery to its list of branded products and introduced two new hunting crossbows in addition to youth archery products. In 2016, Velocity debuted its CenterPoint line of crossbows and the Benjamin Pioneer Airbow, the first ever mass-produced air powered archery device and with the 2018 acquisition of Ravin Crossbows, Velocity expanded their archery product line into the higher-end segment of the crossbow market. In 2017, Velocity acquired the commercial product line of LaserMax, a leading designer and manufacturer of gun-mounted laser aiming devices. 
Today, Velocity Outdoor is an international designer, manufacturer and marketer of Crosman and Benjamin airguns including related ammunition and accessories, archery products including the Ravin and CenterPoint crossbows, airsoft rifles, pistols, and ammunition, laser aiming devices, and precision optics. 
Industry
Velocity Outdoor primarily competes within the airgun and archery sub-segments of the broader outdoor recreational products industry, which together management estimates constitute approximately $1.0 billion of annual retail revenue. Both categories share certain common characteristics, including consumer demand for innovation, similar sales channels, and unique regulatory frameworks. 
The airgun industry is estimated by management to constitute approximately $275 million to $325 million of annual retail revenue, excluding consumables and accessories. With a history stretching back over a century, the industry is generally considered to be a mature sector, with stable growth rates in the low single digits. Airgun products are largely sold through mass merchants and national retailers, with each accounting for roughly 40% of purchases. Independent dealers and online platforms account for approximately 9% and 8% of purchases, respectively, while the balance is purchased directly from the manufacturer. Airguns are less seasonal than archery because there is no defined hunting season, although sales spike somewhat around holidays.
The archery equipment market is estimated by management to constitute between $750 million and $850 million of annual retail sales, of which $400-$450 million is attributable to bows and $350-$400 million is attributable to related archery accessories. Vertical and compound bows are the most prolific type of bow, comprising about half of the category sales, while crossbows make up approximately 35% and youth bows account for the remaining 15%. Outdoor retailers comprise the largest sales channel, accounting for approximately 45% of consumer purchases, while independent archery stores and big box retailers constitute 25% and 13% of total purchases, respectively. E-commerce has grown to hold a 15% share, primarily at the expense of independent archery retailers and big box stores while 2% are direct from the manufacturer.
Products and Services
Velocity designs, manufacturers and markets five categories of products: (i) airguns, (ii) archery products, (iii) consumables, or pellets, BBs and CO2 cartridges, (iv) optics, and (v) airsoft. Velocity's product strategy encompasses producing high quality, feature-rich products recognized by consumers for their craftsmanship and value, and building on a rich history to introduce innovative new products. 
Airguns
Airguns represent Velocity's largest product category. The airgun product line consists of air rifles, air pistols and a range of accessories including targets, holsters and cases. Velocity's airguns are designed to be multi-purpose, multi-occasion products, for use in recreational plinking and target shooting, pest control, and hunting. Velocity offers a “good, better, best” array of airguns under the Crosman and Benjamin brands. The Crosman brand is known for high value at an accessible price, where the Benjamin brand is typically associated with premium products falling within the mid- to high-price point. Additionally, Velocity rounds out its offering with mid-level products produced under an exclusive licensing agreement with Remington for its Remington, Marlin, DPMS, and Bushmaster brands.

Archery Products
Velocity re-entered the archery market in 2016 with a product line anchored by the CenterPoint crossbow and the first-of-its-kind Pioneer Airbow. CenterPoint has grown rapidly since it was launched to become the second largest player in the crossbow category. The CenterPoint Sniper 370 is the top-selling SKU in the crossbow market, with more than twice the volume of its nearest competitor. CenterPoint acquired market share by offering features like an aluminum frame, higher shooting velocity, integrated string stops, a 4x32mm scope and shoulder sling at very competitive retail prices.
Concurrent with the launch of the CenterPoint line of crossbows, Velocity also introduced the Pioneer Airbow. The Pioneer Airbow created a new sportsman category as the first ever mass-produced air-powered archery device, effectively bridging the gap between airguns and archery. Velocity acquired Ravin Crossbows in 2018, further expanding its product line in the archery market. Ravin Crossbows is a leading designer, manufacturer and innovator of crossbows and accessories. Ravin primarily focuses on the higher-end segment of the crossbow market and has developed significant intellectual property related to the advancement of crossbow technology.
Consumables
Velocity's consumables segment consists of steel and plastic BBs, various styles of lead pellets, and single-use CO2 cartridges used to power airguns. BBs are typically used for plinking, training, or target shooting at a more affordable cost, while different pellet styles are designed either for accuracy, maximum penetration, or a combination of the two. Velocity is the world’s largest provider and only domestic manufacturer of CO2 cartridges, having first introduced the use of C02 as an airgun propellant in 1961. Consumables are produced under the Crosman, Benjamin, and Copperhead brand names. 
Optics
Launched in 2006, Velocity's line of optics products offers high-performance, value-priced optics under the CenterPoint brand. The scopes, sights, binoculars, lights, and lasers are marketed for traditional firearms, in addition to select airgun and crossbow offerings. In 2017, Velocity added to their optics product line with the acquisition of the commercial division of LaserMax. LaserMax is a global leader in hardened and miniaturized laser systems, offering a comprehensive line of premium laser sights for home defense, personal protection and training use. LaserMax’s commercial business provides laser sighting solutions and tactical lights to the firearm original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") and retail channels.  Management believes that the addition of the LaserMax products enables Velocity to reach a wider range of new customers across retail channels. 
Airsoft
Airsoft guns are a class of air, CO2, gas, or electric-powered guns that are typically made from high-impact plastics and are engineered with recreation in mind to fire safe, plastic BBs quickly and accurately. Airsoft products are most often used for recreational purposes by a younger demographic and a strong user base amongst military and law enforcement customers. Velocity offers a broad portfolio of airsoft rifles and pistols under its owned Crosman Elite and Game Face brands, as well as the licensed U.S. Marines brand. 
Competitive Conditions
Airguns
Velocity's airgun line competes with offerings from several airgun manufacturers, including Daisy Outdoor Products, Gamo Outdoor USA (which acquired Daisy in July 2016 but remains separately branded), Germany-based Umarex, and more recently Sig-Sauer, which has begun to produce its own line of airguns to complement its powdered firearms offering. The market for airguns is relatively concentrated, led by Crosman, Daisy, Gamo, and Umarex, according to Sports OneSource data. Key determinants in consumer purchasing decisions include product performance, quality, and brand loyalty.
Archery
The archery market competes within a “good, better, best” spectrum. Velocity's CenterPoint product line, as a value-for-price, entry to mid-level brand, tends to lie between the “good” and “better” segments, competing with Barnett Outdoors, Killer Instinct, and PSE technologies, among others. Consumers tend to make purchasing decisions based on brand awareness, reliability, customer service, and pricing. Although CenterPoint is a recent entry into the archery market, the brand has been able to outpace more established brands on the reliability, pricing, and service aspects to win market share. The Ravin product line has a higher price point and falls within the "best" segment for crossbows, 
34

competing with the higher end Tenpoint crossbows. Ravin entered the market in 2017 and has since become the number one selling brand as measured by retail dollars.
Business Strategies
Continued Innovation in Existing Product Categories
Velocity plans to continue to build on its successful history of bringing new, technically superior products to market through leveraging its stringent new product development process, internal manufacturing capabilities, and a flexible supply chain. The company has near-term new product launches and existing product updates planned across all categories, including the highlights below. 

◦ | Airguns - Building on the Silencing Barrel Device (SBD) technology, Velocity is introducing a line of multi-shot break-barrel models that feature a 10 shot clip that advances automatically. Velocity is also enjoying success with licensed products under the Remington, DPMS, and Bushmaster brands. 


◦ | Archery - On the heels of the successful 2016 launch of the CenterPoint crossbow line,Velocity has introduced new crossbow models at higher price point segments of the market, while continuing to build out its archery product line to include accessories and inclusive “ready-to-hunt” kits. Ravin recently introduced two new crossbow models that offer the same speed and accuracy as the current products in a lighter and shorter profile. 


◦ | Optics - In addition to the recently launched three-model CenterPoint Spectrum First Focal Plane series of scopes, the company has plans to expand the CenterPoint optics offering to include binoculars and scope adapters. Additionally, following the launch of the grip activated GripSense lasers in 2017, the company has introduced a universal rail mounted laser featuring the same activation technology. 

Expand into Adjacent Product Categories
Management believes that the company can leverage in-house manufacturing and sourcing partners to develop products in new categories that utilize Velocity's existing distribution network and brand strength. 
Further Penetration of Existing Customer Accounts
Management has identified several strategies for further penetrating its existing customer accounts. First, Velocity has identified opportunities to leverage its existing relationships with retailers to drive expanded SKU offerings across categories. Additionally, management believes the company can expand the CenterPoint brand into the dealer network due to the acquisition of Ravin. Furthermore, management believes that the company is well positioned to grow as its brick-and-mortar customers adapt to a changing retail landscape. Velocity can leverage its structured analytical sales approach and new marketing initiatives to assist retailers with enhancing their online sales, similar to the strategies it already employs working with pure e-commerce customers like Amazon and Pyramyd Air.
Consolidation Platform
With a well-developed global supply chain, refined manufacturing capabilities, sophisticated management systems infrastructure, and extensive network of relevant relationships, Velocity sees itself as a platform for consolidation within both the broader outdoor recreational goods space and the archery space specifically. Management has identified a pipeline of potential acquisition targets that would help Velocity strengthen and expand its product offering and address new market segments. 
International Growth
Velocity is exploring opportunities to grow international sales and increase market share by pursuing new international distributor relationships. Management has recently focused its efforts on key markets within Latin America. However, with a more fulsome archery product line in development, the Company is well positioned to expand into key international bowhunting markets such as Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.
New Product Development
Velocity has developed a repeatable, structured product development process that integrates all areas of the business, including sales, marketing, engineering, purchasing, production and finance. New products must pass a 6 to 18 month stage gating process designed to ensure engineering and commercial viability. Once a product idea is identified, a five-phase step-by-step process is used to either (a) refine the idea into a producible, marketable good, or (b) identify contradicting data that may warrant the project being tabled or canceled altogether. A Product Development Committee must approve the advancement of a new product from one phase to the next. To balance the company’s new product pipeline, aging and underperforming SKUs are regularly culled. This intentional focus on constant innovation and 
35

consumer feedback has helped Velocity establish a portfolio of highly-regarded brands across several product categories.
Customers
Velocity sells its products through nearly all major domestic mass merchants and sporting goods retailers, and has established a strong e-commerce platform to allow for flexibility in a changing retail environment. The four largest customers represent 44% of gross sales in 2018. Three represent the major sales channels; mass merchant, e-commerce, and regional retail, while the fourth represents the Junior Reserves Officers Training Corps (JROTC) contract award.
Seasonality
Velocity typically has higher sales in the third and fourth quarter each year, reflecting the hunting and holiday seasons, respectively. 
Sales and Marketing
Velocity's products are sold through over 425 customers across a mix of sales channels, including mass merchants, national retailers, distributors/dealers/regional chains, international distributors, and e-commerce. Over the last 5 years, Management has successfully diversified both its sales channel composition and customer mix.
Velocity sells its products through nearly all major domestic mass merchants and sporting goods retailers currently selling airguns, and has established a strong e-commerce platform to allow for flexibility in a changing retail environment. The company has been selling to many of its customers for over 20 years, maintaining close relationships with key purchasing personnel through high-touch customer service. Velocity is one of the only players in the sportsman category offering category management services, product assortment, and SKU optimization feedback typical of larger multinational consumer products companies. This data-sharing has resulted in higher retailer sell-through and margin enhancement, more accurate sales forecasting, and a 98% fulfillment rate, all of which are key components in maintaining status as a vendor of choice. 
Velocity maintains an internal sales team responsible for covering the vast majority of its customer relationships, or approximately 90% of total sales. Furthermore, Velocity supplements its in-house team with four independent sales representative organizations, providing coverage for approximate 375 additional customers across their respective geographic territories. International sales efforts are handled by Velocity-employed account executives who work through local distributors in order to ensure that products conform to local regulatory standards.
Velocity had a backlog of $3.5 million and $12.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Manufacturing and Distribution Channels
Velocity's product manufacturing is based on a dual strategy of in-house manufacturing and strategic alliances with select sub-contractors and vendors. Velocity conducts its domestic manufacturing operations in two locations. The first is a 225,000 square foot facility on a company-owned 49-acre campus located in East Bloomfield, New York, approximately 30 miles southeast of Rochester. The second is an 85,000 square foot leased facility in Superior, Wisconsin. In addition, the company utilizes approximately 144,000 square feet of leased warehouse space in nearby Farmington, New York, five miles from the East Bloomfield facility. 
Intellectual Property
Velocity Outdoor currentlyholds a global portfolio of more than 100 registered trademarks and a global patent portfolio of more than 50 issued patents with many more pending. Management considers its patent holdings, trademarked brand names, preeminent name recognition, ability to design innovative products, and technical and marketing expertise to be its primary competitive advantages.
Regulatory Environment
Airguns
Airguns enjoy a relatively unrestrictive federal regulatory framework, with most regulations determined at the state level. Although there are no federal laws regulating their transfer, possession or use, non-powder guns are subject to oversight from the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CSPC”). Therefore, airguns are subject to generalized statutory limitations involving “substantial product hazard” and articles that pose a substantial risk of injury to children, though the CSPC has not adopted specific mandatory regulations in this area. Federal law prevents states from prohibiting the sale of airguns, but allows for state-by-state restrictions on sales of airguns to minors. Thirteen states 
36

have imposed such restrictions. Historically, there have not been attempts to grandfather the regulation of airguns into that of traditional powdered firearms, as legislative efforts have largely focused on responding to and refining the existing regulatory frameworks for each respective category rather than overhauling the coordination or transfer of enforcement duties across agencies.
Archery
Crossbow hunting restrictions have become less stringent over the last ten years. Since 2006, 12 states, including populous hunting states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, have legalized crossbow hunting, while many others moved to relax restrictions through the opening of limited seasons or creation of exceptions to hunting restrictions for those with disabilities. Today, only Oregon classifies crossbows as illegal. As of 2017, nearly 90% of all hunting permits are filed in states that currently allow crossbow hunting for at least part of the season. Although continued deregulation is expected, it likely will not continue to be a large driver for the crossbow category moving forward. 
Employees
Velocity had 333 employees at December 31, 2018. Velocity’s labor force is non-union. Management believes that Velocity has an excellent relationship with its employees. 
Niche Industrial Businesses
Advanced Circuits
Overview
Advanced Circuits, headquartered in Aurora, Colorado, is a provider of small-run, quick-turn and production rigid PCBs, throughout the United States. Advanced Circuits also provides its customers with assembly services in order to meet its customers’ complete PCB needs. The small-run and quick-turn portions of the PCB industry are characterized by customers requiring high levels of responsiveness, technical support and timely delivery. Due to the critical roles that PCBs play in the research and development process of electronics, customers often place more emphasis on the turnaround time and quality of a customized PCB than on the price. Advanced Circuits meets this market need by manufacturing and delivering custom PCBs in as little as 24 hours, providing customers with over 98% error-free production and real-time customer service and product tracking 24 hours per day. 
History of Advanced Circuits
Advanced Circuits commenced operations in 1989 through the acquisition of a small Denver-based PCB manufacturer. During its first years of operations, Advanced Circuits focused exclusively on manufacturing high volume, production run PCBs with a small group of proportionately large customers. After the loss of a significant customer in the early 1990s, Advanced Circuits began focusing on developing a diverse customer base, and in particular, on meeting the demands of equipment manufacturers with low-volume, high-margin, customized small-run and quick-turn PCBs.
We purchased a controlling interest in Advanced Circuits on May 16, 2006. Since our acquisition, Advanced Circuits has completed several add-on acquisitions that expanded their customer base in various industries and sectors, including the aerospace and defense industry and the long-lead sector. Over 50% of Advanced Circuits’ sales are derived from highly profitable small-run and quick-turn production PCBs. Advanced Circuits’ success is demonstrated by its broad base of over 11,000 customers with which it does business throughout the year.
Industry
The PCB industry, which consists of both large global PCB manufacturers and small regional PCB manufacturers, is a vital component to all electronic equipment supply chains, as PCBs serve as the foundation for virtually all electronic products, including cellular telephones, appliances, personal computers, routers, switches and network servers. PCBs are used by manufacturers of these types of electronic products, as well as by persons and teams engaged in research and development of new types of equipment and technologies.
Several significant trends are present within the PCB manufacturing industry. Production of PCBs in North America has declined in recent years due to increased competition for volume production of PCBs from Asian competitors benefiting from both lower labor costs and less restrictive waste and environmental regulations. Asian based manufacturers of PCBs are capitalizing on their lower labor costs and increasing their market share of volume production PCBs, which are used in high volume consumer electronics application such as computers and cell phones. This “offshoring” of high-volume production orders has placed increased pricing pressure and margin compression on many 
37

small domestic manufacturers that are no longer operating at full capacity. Many of these small producers are choosing to cease operations, rather than operate at a loss, as their scale, plant design and customer relationships do not allow them to focus profitably on the small-run and quick-turn sectors of the market. While Asian manufacturers have made large market share gains in the PCB industry overall, small-run and quick-turn production, some of the more complex volume production, and military production have remained strong in the United States. Rapid advances in technology are significantly shortening product life-cycles and placing increased pressure on original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") to develop new products in shorter periods of time. In response to these pressures, OEMs invest heavily in research and development, which results in a demand for PCB companies that can offer engineering support and quick-turn production services to minimize the product development process. Additionally, increased complexity of electronic equipment requires maintaining the production infrastructure necessary to manufacture PCBs of increasing complexity. This often requires significant capital expenditures and has acted to reduce the competitiveness of local and regional PCB manufacturers lacking the scale to make such investments.
Both globally and domestically, the PCB market can be separated into three categories based on required lead time and order volume:

• | Small-run PCBs — These PCBs are typically manufactured for customers in research and development departments of OEMs, and academic institutions. Small-run PCBs are manufactured to the specifications of the customer, within certain manufacturing guidelines designed to increase speed and reduce production costs. Prototyping is a critical stage in the research and development of new products. These small-runs are used in the design and launch of new electronic equipment and are typically ordered in volumes of 1 to 50 PCBs. Because the small-run is used primarily in the research and development phase of a new electronic product, the life cycle is relatively short and requires accelerated delivery time frames of usually less than five days and very high, error-free quality. Order, production and delivery time, as well as responsiveness with respect to each, are key factors for customers as PCBs are indispensable to their research and development activities.


• | Quick-Turn Production PCBs — These PCBs are used for intermediate stages of testing for new products prior to full scale production. After a new product has successfully completed the small-run phase, customers undergo test marketing and other technical testing. This stage requires production of larger quantities of PCBs in a short period of time, generally 10 days or less, while it does not yet require high production volumes. This transition stage between low-volume small-run production and volume production is known as quick-turn production. Manufacturing specifications conform strictly to end product requirements and order quantities are typically in volumes of 10 to 500. Similar to small-run PCBs, response time remains crucial as the delivery of quick-turn PCBs can be a gating item in the development of electronic products. Orders for quick-turn production PCBs conform specifically to the customer’s exact end product requirements.


• | Volume Production PCBs — These PCBs, which we sometimes refer to as “long lead” and “sub-contract” are used in the full scale production of electronic equipment and specifications conform strictly to end product requirements. Volume Production PCBs are ordered in large quantities, usually over 100 units, and response time is less important, ranging between 15 days to 10 weeks or more.

These categories can be further distinguished based on board complexity, with each portion facing different competitive threats. Advanced Circuits competes largely in the small-run and quick-turn production portions of the North American market, which have not been significantly impacted by Asian-based manufacturers due to the quick response time required for these products. Management believes the North American PCB market was estimated to be approximately $3.5 billion in 2018.
Products and Services
A PCB is comprised of layers of laminate and contains patterns of electrical circuitry to connect electronic components. Advanced Circuits typically manufactures 2 to 20 layer PCBs, and has the capability to manufacture even higher layer PCBs. The level of PCB complexity is determined by several characteristics, including size, layer count, density (line width and spacing), materials and functionality. Beyond complexity, a PCB’s unit cost is determined by the quantity of identical units ordered, as engineering and production setup costs per unit decrease with order volume, and required production time, as longer times often allow increased efficiencies and better production management. Advanced Circuits primarily manufactures lower complexity PCBs.
Advanced Circuits assists its customers throughout the life-cycle of their products, from product conception through volume production. Advanced Circuits works closely with customers throughout each phase of the PCB development process, beginning with the PCB design verification stage using its unique online FreeDFM.com tool, FreeDFM.com™, which enables customers to receive a free manufacturability assessment report within minutes, resolving design problems that would prohibit manufacturability before the order process is completed and manufacturing begins. The 
38

combination of Advanced Circuits’ user-friendly website and its design verification tool reduces the amount of human labor involved in the manufacture of each order as PCBs move from Advanced Circuits’ website directly to its computer numerical control, or CNC, machines for production, saving Advanced Circuits and customers cost and time. As a result of its ability to rapidly and reliably respond to the critical customer requirements, Advanced Circuits receives a premium for their small-run and quick-turn PCBs as compared to volume production PCBs.
Advanced Circuits manufactures all high margin small-runs and quick-turn orders internally and occasionally utilizes external partners to manufacture production orders that do not fit within its capabilities or capacity constraints at a given time. As a result, Advanced Circuits constantly adjusts the portion of volume production PCBs produced internally to both maximize profitability and ensure that internal capacity is fully utilized.
The following table shows Advanced Circuits’ gross revenue by products and services for the periods indicated:

Competitive Strengths
Advanced Circuits has established itself as a leading provider of small-run and quick-turn PCBs in North America and focuses on satisfying customer demand for on-time delivery of high-quality PCBs. Advanced Circuits’ management believes the following factors differentiate it from many industry competitors:

• | Numerous Unique Orders Per Day — Advanced Circuits receives on average over 300 customer orders per day. Due to the large quantity of orders received, Advanced Circuits is able to combine multiple orders in a single panel design prior to production. Through this process, Advanced Circuits is able to reduce the number of costly, labor intensive equipment set-ups required to complete several manufacturing orders. As labor represents the single largest cost of production, management believes this capability gives Advanced Circuits a unique advantage over other industry participants.


• | Diverse Customer Base — Advanced Circuits possesses a customer base with little industry or customer concentration exposure. For each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, no customer represented more than 2% of net sales. 


• | Highly Responsive Culture and Organization — A key strength of Advanced Circuits is its ability to quickly respond to customer orders and complete the production process. In contrast to many competitors that require a day or more to offer price quotes on small-run or quick-turn production, Advanced Circuits offers its customers quotes within seconds and the ability to place or track orders any time of day. In addition, Advanced Circuits’ production facility operates three shifts per day and is able to ship a customer’s product within 24 hours of receiving its order.


• | Proprietary FreeDFM.comTM Software — Advanced Circuits offers its customers unique design verification services through its online FreeDFM.com tool. This tool enables customers to receive a free manufacturability assessment report, within minutes, resolving design problems before customers place their orders. The service is relied upon by many of Advanced Circuits’ customers to reduce design errors and minimize production costs. Beyond improved customer service, FreeDFM.comTM has the added benefit of improving the efficiency of Advanced Circuits’ engineers, as many routine design problems, which typically require an engineer’s time and attention to identify, are identified and sent back to customers automatically.


• | Established Partner Network — Advanced Circuits has established third party production relationships with PCB manufacturers in North America and Asia. Through these relationships, Advanced Circuits is able to offer its customers a complete suite of products including those outside of its core production capabilities. Additionally, these relationships allow Advanced Circuits to outsource orders for volume production and focus internal capacity on higher margin, short lead time, production and quick-turn manufacturing.

Business Strategies
Advanced Circuits’ management is focused on strategies to increase market share and further improve operating efficiencies. The following is a discussion of these strategies:
Increase Portion of Revenue from Small-run and Quick-Turn Production — Advanced Circuits’ management believes it can grow revenues and cash flow by continuing to leverage its core small-run and quick-turn capabilities. Over its history, Advanced Circuits has developed a suite of capabilities that management believes allow it to offer a combination of price and customer service unequaled in the market. Advanced Circuits intends to leverage this factor, as well as its core skill set, to increase net sales derived from higher margin small-run and quick-turn production PCBs. 
Acquire Customers from Local and Regional Competitors — Advanced Circuits’ management believes the majority of its competition for small-run and quick-turn PCB orders comes from smaller scale local and regional PCB manufacturers. Advanced Circuits continues to enter into small-run and quick-turn manufacturing relationships with several subscale local and regional PCB manufacturers. Management believes that while many of these manufacturers maintain strong, long-standing customer relationships, they are unable to produce PCBs with short turn-around times at competitive prices. As a result, Advanced Circuits sees an opportunity for growth by providing production support to these manufacturers or direct support to the customers of these manufacturers, whereby the manufacturers act more as a broker for the relationship.
Remain Committed to Customers and Employees — Advanced Circuits has remained focused on providing the highest quality products and services to its customers. Management believes this focus has allowed Advanced Circuits to achieve its outstanding delivery and quality record. Advanced Circuits’ management believes this reputation is a key competitive differentiator and is focused on maintaining and building upon it. Similarly, management believes its committed base of employees is a key differentiating factor. Management believes that Advanced Circuits’ emphasis on sharing rewards and creating a positive work environment has led to increased loyalty. Advanced Circuits plans to continue to focus on similar programs to maintain this competitive advantage.
Opportunistically Acquire Smaller PCB Manufacturers — Historically, Advanced Circuits has selectively made tuck-in acquisitions of regional PCB manufacturers. Management will continue to seek tuck-in acquisitions of smaller PCB manufacturers where sales and operational efficiencies can be realized, or strategic technical capabilities expanded.
Research and Development
Advanced Circuits engages in continual research and development activities in the ordinary course of business to update or strengthen its order processing, production and delivery systems. By engaging in these activities, Advanced Circuits expects to maintain and build upon the competitive strengths from which it benefits currently. Research and development expenses were not material in each of the last three years.
Customers and Distribution Channels
Advanced Circuits’ focus on customer service and product quality has resulted in a broad base of customers in a variety of end markets, including industrial, consumer, telecommunications, aerospace/defense, biotechnology and electronics manufacturing. These customers range in size from large, blue-chip manufacturers to small, not-for-profit university engineering departments. The following table sets forth management’s estimate of Advanced Circuits’ approximate customer breakdown by industry sector for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:
40


 | Customer Distribution | 
Industry Sector | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Electrical Equipment and Components | 25 | % | | 24 | % | 22 | %
Measuring Instruments | 3 | % | | 5 | % | 4 | %
Electronics Manufacturing Services | 21 | % | | 24 | % | 21 | %
Engineer Services | 2 | % | | 3 | % | 4 | %
Industrial and Commercial Machinery | 16 | % | | 15 | % | 12 | %
Business Services | 1 | % | | 1 | % | 2 | %
Wholesale Trade-Durable Goods | 1 | % | | 1 | % | 1 | %
Educational Institutions | 12 | % | | 10 | % | 17 | %
Transportation Equipment | 7 | % | | 8 | % | 12 | %
All Other Sectors Combined | 12 | % | | 9 | % | 5 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Management estimates that over 75% of its orders are generated from existing customers. Moreover, more than half of Advanced Circuits’ orders in each of the years 2018, 2017 and 2016 were delivered within five days (not including long-lead orders). In a typical year, no single customer represents more than 3% of Advanced Circuits’ sales.
Sales and Marketing
Advanced Circuits has established a “consumer products” marketing strategy to both acquire new customers and retain existing customers. Advanced Circuits uses initiatives such as direct mail postcards, web banners, aggressive pricing specials and proactive outbound customer call programs as part of this strategy. Advanced Circuits spends approximately 1% of net sales each year on its marketing initiatives and advertising and has employees organized geographically throughout North America dedicated to its marketing and sales efforts. The sales team takes a systematic approach to placing sales calls and receiving inquiries and, on average, will place over 200 outbound sales calls and receive approximately 140 inbound phone inquiries per day. Beyond proactive customer acquisition initiatives, management believes a substantial portion of new customers are acquired through referrals from existing customers. In addition, other customers are acquired on-line where Advanced Circuits generates over 90% of its orders from its website. Substantially all revenue is derived from sales within the United States.
Advanced Circuits, due to the volume of small-run and quick turn sales, had a negligible amount in firm backlog orders at December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Competition
There are currently an estimated 165 active domestic PCB manufacturers. Advanced Circuits’ competitors differ amongst its products and services.
Competitors in the small-run and quick-turn PCBs production industry include larger companies as well as small domestic manufacturers. The largest independent domestic small-run and quick-turn PCB manufacturer in North America is TTM Technologies, Inc. Though this company produces small-run PCBs to varying degrees, in many ways it is not a direct competitor with Advanced Circuits. In recent years, larger competitors have primarily focused on producing boards with greater complexity in response to the offshoring of low and medium layer count technology to Asia. Compared to Advanced Circuits, small-run and quick-turn PCB production accounts for much smaller portions of larger competitors revenues. Further, these competitors often have much greater customer concentrations and a greater portion of sales through large electronics manufacturing services intermediaries. Beyond large, public companies, Advanced Circuits’ competitors include numerous small, local and regional manufacturers, often with revenues under $20 million that have long-term customer relationships and typically produce both small-run and quick-turn PCBs and production PCBs for small OEMs and EMS companies. The competitive factors in small-run and quick-turn production PCBs are response time, quality, error-free production and customer service. Competitors in the long lead-time production PCBs generally include large companies, including Asian manufacturers, where price is the key competitive factor.
New market entrants into small-run and quick-turn production PCBs confront substantial barriers including significant investments in equipment, highly skilled workforce with extensive engineering knowledge and compliance with 
41

environmental regulations. Beyond these tangible barriers, Advanced Circuits’ management believes that its network of customers, established over the last two decades, would be very difficult for a competitor to replicate.
Suppliers
Advanced Circuits’ raw materials inventory is small relative to sales and must be regularly and rapidly replenished. Advanced Circuits uses a just-in-time procurement practice to maintain raw materials inventory at low levels. Additionally, Advanced Circuits has established consignment relationships with several vendors allowing it to pay for raw materials as used. Because it provides primarily lower-volume quick-turn services, this inventory policy does not hamper its ability to complete customer orders. Raw material costs constituted approximately 23%, 21% and 19% of net sales for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The primary raw materials that are used in production are core materials, such as copper clad layers of glass and chemical solutions, and copper and gold for plating operations, photographic film and carbide drill bits. Multiple suppliers and sources exist for all materials. Adequate amounts of all raw materials have been available in the past, and Advanced Circuits’ management believes this will continue in the foreseeable future. Advanced Circuits works closely with its suppliers to incorporate technological advances in the raw materials they purchase. Advanced Circuits does not believe that it has significant exposure to fluctuations in raw material prices. The fact that price is not the primary factor affecting the purchase decision of many of Advanced Circuits’ customers has allowed management to historically pass along a portion of raw material price increases to its customers. Advanced Circuits does not knowingly purchase material originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries.
Intellectual Property
Advanced Circuits seeks to protect certain proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with its employees, consultants and customers, as needed, and generally limits access to and distribution of its proprietary information and processes. Advanced Circuits’ management does not believe that patents are critical to protecting Advanced Circuits’ core intellectual property, but, rather, its effective and quick execution of fabrication techniques, its website FreeDFM.com™ and its highly skilled workforce are the primary factors in maintaining its competitive position.
Advanced Circuits uses the following brand names: FreeDFM.com™, 4pcb.com™, 4PCB.com™, 33each.com™, barebonespcb.com™ and Advanced Circuits™. These trade names have strong brand equity and are material to Advanced Circuits’ business.
Regulatory Environment
Advanced Circuits’ manufacturing operations and facilities are subject to evolving federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. These include laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharge and the storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous substances. Management believes that Advanced Circuits is in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. New requirements, more stringent application of existing requirements, or discovery of previously unknown environmental conditions may result in material environmental expenditures in the future. Advanced Circuits has been recognized three times for exemplary environmental compliance and it was awarded the Denver Metro Wastewater Reclamation District Gold Award for seven of the last ten years.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, Advanced Circuits employed 474 persons. None of Advanced Circuits’ employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Advanced Circuits believes its relationship with its employees is good.

Arnold operates 9 manufacturing facilities worldwide split under the three business units shown above but functions as one company and one team. 
History of Arnold
Arnold was founded in 1895 as the Arnold Electric Power Station Company. Arnold began producing AlNiCo permanent magnets in its Marengo, Illinois facility in the mid-1930s. In 1946, Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corporation (Allegheny) purchased Arnold, and over the next few years began production of several additional magnetic product lines under license agreement with the Western Electric Company. In 1970, Arnold acquired Ogallala Electronics, which manufactured high power coils and electromagnets.
SPS Technologies (SPS), at the time a publicly traded company, purchased Arnold Engineering Company from Allegheny in 1986. Under SPS, Arnold made a series of acquisitions and partnerships to expand its portfolio and geographic reach. In 2003, Precision Castparts, also a publicly traded company, acquired SPS. In January 2005, Audax, a Boston-based private equity firm acquired Arnold from Precision Castparts.
In February 2007, Arnold Magnetic Technologies completed the acquisition of Precision Magnetics, which expanded its geographic footprint to include operations in Sheffield, England and Lupfig, Switzerland.  In addition, Arnold’s Lupfig, Switzerland operation is a joint venture partner with a Chinese rare earth producer. The joint venture manufactures RECOMA® Samarium Cobalt blocks for select markets.
In 2016 Arnold developed and launched the world’s strongest Samarium Cobalt magnet grade, RECOMA 35E, that enables significant opportunity for increased performance in smaller packages, and at higher temperatures, with no trade off in stability. 
We purchased a majority interest in Arnold on March 5, 2012. With the support of CODI, Arnold has made significant investment to support future growth strategies. 
Industry
Permanent Magnets
There exists a broad range of permanent magnets which include Rare Earth Magnets and magnets made from specialty magnetic alloys. Magnets produced from these materials may be sliced, ground, coated and magnetized to customer requirements. Those industry players with the broadest portfolio of these magnets, such as Arnold, maintain a significant competitive advantage over competitors as they are able to offer one-stop shop capabilities to customers. Management believes that being a manufacturer of these magnets, subject to patent rights, is another critical market advantage.
Magnetic Assemblies- Arnold offers complex, customized value added magnetic assemblies. These assemblies are used in devices such as motors, generators, beam focusing arrays, sensors, and solenoid actuators. Magnetic assembly production capabilities include machined metal components, magnet fabrication, machining, encapsulation or sleeving, balancing, and field mapping.
43

Rare Earth Magnets

• | Samarium Cobalt (SmCo) - SmCo magnets are typically used in critical applications that require corrosion resistance or high temperature stability, such as motors, generators, actuators and sensors. Arnold markets its SmCo magnets under the trade name of RECOMA ®, and is DFARS (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation) compliant.


• | Neodymium (Neo) - Neo magnets offer the highest magnetic energy level of any material in the market. Applications include motors and generators, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic inspection systems, sensors and loudspeakers. 

Other Permanent Magnet Types

• | AlNiCo - The AlNiCo family of magnets remains a preferred material for many mission critical applications. Its favorable linear temperature characteristics, high magnetic flux density and good corrosion resistance are ideally suited for use in applications requiring magnetic stability. This material is manufactured by Arnold in the United States, making it a DFARS compliant material. 


• | Hard Ferrite - Hard ferrite (ceramic) magnets were developed as a low cost alternative to metallic magnets (steel and AlNiCo). Although they exhibit lower energy when compared to other materials available today and are relatively brittle, ferrite magnets have gained acceptance due to their low price per magnetic output.


• | Injection Molded - Injection molded magnets are a composite of various types of resin and magnetic powders. The physical and magnetic properties of the product depend on the raw materials, but are generally lower in magnetic strength and resemble plastics in their physical properties. However, a major benefit of the injection

44

molding process is that magnet material can be injection or over-molded, eliminating subsequent manufacturing steps.

Competitive Strengths
Competitive Landscape
The specialty magnetic systems industry is highly fragmented, creating a competitive landscape with a variety of magnetic component manufacturers. However, few have the breadth of capabilities that Arnold possesses. Manufacturers compete on the basis of technical innovation, co-development capabilities, time-to-market, quality, geographic reach and total cost of ownership. Industry competitors relevant to Arnold’s served markets range from large multinational manufacturers to small, regional participants. Given these dynamics, we believe the industry will likely favor players that are able to achieve vertical integration and a diversification of offerings across a breadth of products along with magnet engineering and design expertise. The focus will be engineering solutions together with our customers. 
Barriers to Entry

• | Low Substitution Risk – Arnold’s solutions are typically specified into its customers’ program designs through a co-development and qualification process that often takes 6-18 months. Arnold’s customers are typically contractors and component manufacturers whose products are integrated into end-customers’ applications. The high cost of failure, relatively low proportionate cost of magnets to the final product, sometimes lengthy

45

testing and qualification process, and substantial upfront co-engineering investment required, represent significant barriers to customers changing solution providers such as Arnold.

• | Equipment and Processing – Arnold’s existing base of production equipment has a significant estimated replacement cost. A new entrant could require as much as 2-3 years of lead time to match the process performance requirements, customization of equipment and material formulations necessary to effectively compete in the specialty magnet industry. Further, given the program nature of a majority Arnold’s sales, management estimates that it could take 5-10 years to build a sufficient book of business and base of institutional knowledge to generate positive cash flow out of a new manufacturing plant.

Clean Earth
Overview
Headquartered in Hatboro, Pennsylvania, Clean Earth provides environmental services for a variety of contaminated materials including soils, dredged material, and hazardous waste. Clean Earth analyzes, treats, documents and recycles waste streams generated in multiple end markets such as utilities, infrastructure, chemicals, aerospace and defense, non-public/ private development, medical, industrial and dredging. Treatment includes thermal desorption, dredged material stabilization, bioremediation, physical treatment/screening and chemical fixation. Before the company accepts contaminated materials, it identifies a third party “beneficial reuse” site such as infrastructure projects, commercial redevelopment or daily landfill cover and capping where the materials will be sent after they are treated. Clean Earth operates 29 permitted facilities in the Eastern United States. Revenues from the environmental processing facilities are generally recognized at the time of receipt.
History of Clean Earth
Clean Earth was founded in 1990 with the establishment of a contaminated material treatment facility in New Castle, Delaware focused on processing soils. The treatment of contaminated materials has diversified significantly over the years as Clean Earth now also processes hazardous waste, dredged material, coal ash and hazardous wastewater. Clean Earth has been able to grow consistently via both organic initiatives and acquisition. In 1997, the Company opened Clean Earth of Carteret, which was the first “fixed-based” bioremediation facility permitted in the State of New Jersey. In 1998, Clean Earth started offering hazardous waste treatment after acquiring S&W Waste, now Clean Earth of North Jersey, a fully permitted commercial Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) Part B Treatment, Storage & Disposal Facility (“TSDF”). That same year, Clean Earth also expanded services into the treatment of dredged material through the acquisition of Consolidated Technologies Inc. (now Clean Earth Dredging Technologies). Today, Clean Earth is one of the largest providers of contaminated materials and hazardous waste treatment in the East. In addition to diversifying the number of contaminated materials it handles, Clean Earth has also significantly expanded its geography. The Company now operates permitted facilities from New Hampshire to Florida, and with its recent acquisitions, Clean Earth has expanded its footprint of permitted facilities to Kentucky, West Virginia, Alabama, California, Virginia, Georgia, New York, Michigan, New Hampshire and North Carolina.
We purchased a majority interest in Clean Earth on August 26, 2014.
Industry
Overview 
The U.S. environmental services industry is highly fragmented, with Clean Earth most closely correlated with the contaminated materials treatment and hazardous waste management segments of the industry. Historically, growth in these sectors has been primarily driven by increasing regulations and growing volume of waste generated and is now positively affected by increases in waste disposal costs and resulting landfill avoidance trends. Other trends driving growth include increasing concern in corporate America regarding environmental liabilities and a push by companies to outsource a larger amount of environmental services to a smaller number of service providers due to increasing compliance costs.

Contaminated Materials
Contamination of soils and other materials is prevalent and often caused by the introduction of chemicals, petroleum hydrocarbons, solvents, pesticides, lead and other heavy metals into the earth. These contaminants are common in areas of industrialization and severely impact the environment as a result of inadequate containment or improper disposal. As a result of their prevalence and impact, these contaminates are subject to ever more stringent environmental regulations which now govern the handling, treatment, and disposal of these contaminants. As a result, when soil or other materials are removed from a site, they must be tested. The strong likelihood that materials will contain some level of contamination generates consistent demand for treatment and beneficial reuse solutions. Contaminated materials are routinely associated with infrastructure, commercial development, and other excavation projects, heavy industrial activity, spill clean-up or environmental remediation projects, locations with former manufactured gas plants (“MGP”), underground storage tanks (“UST”) or aboveground storage tanks, and a wide variety of increasingly regulated waste streams. 
Dredge Market
Dredging is the act of removing sediment from the bottom of waterways, both inland (rivers and canals) and ocean (floors, harbors, channels, etc.), and is performed for both navigational and environmental purposes. Like soil, most dredged material largely contains some level of contamination, particularly in current or historically industrially active areas. Accordingly, the Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") has established regulations that govern the disposal methods of dredged material, including the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (“MPRSA”), and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act.
The treatment and beneficial reuse of dredged material began in 1995, when various government entities in New Jersey and New York permitted a unique project to demonstrate the feasibility of using treated and processed dredged material to reclaim a former landfill and repurpose it for a new building project. Regulations require contaminated dredge materials to be taken upland for treatment or disposal in accordance with Title 33 as administered by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA. Once treated, dredged material is used for structural fill and development purposes. 
Hazardous Waste
The hazardous waste services industry encompasses the generation, collection, treatment, and ultimate disposal of wastes classified as hazardous by RCRA. RCRA, the primary law governing the disposal of solid and hazardous waste, was passed by Congress in 1976 to address increasing problems associated with growing volumes of municipal and industrial waste. 
In addition to hazardous waste generated by industrial activity, improper handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste, accidents, spills, and leaks have resulted in the contamination of land, water and air in the U.S. The U.S. generated 34 million tons of hazardous waste in 2015, according to the EPA. These wastes come primarily from three sources, routine business, increasingly expanding waste regulations and Superfund sites.
Increasingly complex regulations have expanded the scope of what is considered hazardous waste from non-traditional sources, such as retailers and households. For instance, environmental regulations require large quantity generators such as big box retailers to dispose of all returned or damaged products that include pesticides, aerosols, fertilizers and cleaners through a permitted hazardous waste disposal program. Similarly, household products, such as paints, oils, batteries, fluorescent light bulbs and pesticides, which contain potentially hazardous ingredients, require special treatment and disposal.
Hazardous waste is also generated during the routine course of business and manufacturing, requiring the same care of handling by a specialized treatment facility. The generation of hazardous waste is common throughout the chemicals and petrochemical, steel, general manufacturing, government, aerospace and public utilities industries. Within the U.S., the Northeast region is one of the most densely concentrated areas for generators of hazardous waste. 
In order to address these environmental hazards, the EPA established a program known as the Superfund, which allows the EPA to clean up such sites, or to compel responsible parties to perform clean-ups or reimburse the EPA for its clean-up expenses. This includes regulatory requirements that raise both the monetary and reputational costs for non-compliance. The Superfund program has identified tens of thousands of sites that require treatment over its more than 20-year history. 
50

Growing and Increasingly Regulated Waste Streams 
Federal, state and local regulators have continuously expanded legal guidelines to include additional waste streams, becoming increasingly vigilant to ensure the proper treatment and disposal of an ever-increasing number of contaminants. Two of the most prevalent increasingly regulated waste streams include hazardous waste water from natural gas drilling and coal ash, a byproduct of fossil fuel power plants. 
Services
Clean Earth provides services to a variety of customers handling numerous unique sites that often require a range of custom solutions based upon project-specific factors. Clean Earth provides its core material treatment capabilities and complementary services. In addition to its treatment offerings, Clean Earth also provides turnkey services that include proper identification of waste services, management of all transportation and logistics, appropriate testing and analytics, manifesting/documentation and environmentally compliant placement of treated materials at backend locations. 
Site Planning and Sampling
Before work commences, Clean Earth has the ability to conduct waste characterization services consisting of field sampling, contaminated material collection and laboratory analysis. Properly identifying waste contaminants upfront can be important, as misclassification leads to mishandling of the waste, which can be costly in terms of fines, penalties, reduced recycling rates (increased disposal fees), and lost project time. Results are analyzed to assess time, cost and logistics, which give Clean Earth the ability to provide customers with a disposal recommendation and a cost-effective solution. 
Testing and Analytics
Clean Earth utilizes internal and external, fully-certified and approved laboratories that perform field sampling and contaminated material collection, laboratory analysis, site sampling plans and sampling location diagrams. Laboratory testing is customizable, and Clean Earth determines appropriate testing methods to assess the quantity and type of contaminant in the material. Clean Earth analyzes the results to determine an appropriate treatment and beneficial reuse plan specific to each material. Clean Earth maintains a state-certified hazardous waste laboratory in the New York metropolitan area at its Kearny, New Jersey facility. 
Transportation and Logistics
Clean Earth operates an asset-light business model in which it arranges for transportation of the materials on behalf of its customers via pre-qualified independent hauling companies for the vast majority of its volume. Due to Clean Earth’s ability to provide year-round work for transportation companies and its consistent payment practices, it has developed very strong and long-standing relationships with its vendors, providing a large pool of available trucks to complete projects efficiently. 
Manifesting and Documentation
Clean Earth provides uniform manifests for customer projects that can be used throughout its network of facilities. These manifests provide tracking of all material moved from a customer site to its facilities and eventually to the final beneficial use site. Furthermore, these documents are maintained and submitted to regulatory agencies such as the EPA for their review. 
Treatment
Clean Earth offers several processes to treat, stabilize and/or decharacterize waste material and subsequently avoid costly landfill disposal and meet strict regulatory and site-specific requirements before being beneficially reused. 

• | Thermal Desorption


◦ | Primarily used to treat soil with high levels of volatile contaminants by heating it in a rotating dryer to volatilize and then subsequently destroy the contaminants


◦ | The treated material then enters a soil conditioner (called a pugmill), where it is cooled and rehydrated


◦ | Finally, the cooled soil is stockpiled, sampled, and tested by an independent certified laboratory to ensure effective treatment and fulfillment of reuse standards


◦ | This treatment method is primarily used for soils that contain high levels of contaminants, such as soil from manufactured gas plant sites


• | Stabilization of Dredged Material


◦ | Dredged sediments are screened to remove large objects and excess water

51


◦ | The remaining material is fed through a conveyor belt to a pugmill mixing system, where proprietary reagent admixtures are introduced


◦ | The resulting material is valued for its geotechnical properties and is beneficially reused as fill material


• | Bioremediation


◦ | Used to treat soil that is contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons


◦ | Involves inoculating the contaminated material with engineered bacteria and nutrients to break down the contaminants


◦ | The bacteria consume and process the nutrients and the hydrocarbons thereby remediating the contaminants


• | Chemical Fixation


◦ | Used for light to medium hydrocarbon and/or contaminated material impacted by light or heavy metals


◦ | Soil is screened, and paired with chemical additives to formulate a chemically stable and geotechnically desirable material


• | Physical Treatment/Screening


◦ | Special sizing and segregation processes remove unsuitable materials from inbound materials to meet site-specific geotechnical specifications


◦ | The segregated material, often rock, can be mixed with other material for reuse or crushed to create aggregate material for resale

Placement at Backend Sites
Clean Earth maintains a vast network of permitted, active backend locations owned by third parties that utilize its treated materials to achieve site specifications and/or meet regulatory obligations. Clean Earth operates a system in which before accepting any material it identifies which specific backend site will accept it and how much it will cost to treat, transport, and place. Its beneficial reuse solutions serve as an alternative to permitted landfill disposal and incineration. In order to ensure sufficient capacity for any future project, Clean Earth continuously seeks to add backend sites to its network. 
Business Strategies
Growth in Clean Earth’s business is primarily focused in five areas:
Continued participation in large and growing end markets
Within the U.S. environmental services market, Clean Earth primarily operates within the remediation and hazardous waste management segments. Growth in the industry will be driven by numerous secular trends, including an increasing national awareness and dedication to environmental stewardship, regulatory guidelines for a growing number of contaminated waste streams, and increasing prevalence of and preference for cost-effective landfill avoidance and recycling strategies. As a result of these market trends, generators or those responsible for contaminated waste streams will likely seek to utilize service providers like Clean Earth that can offer environmentally compliant and cost-effective solutions for their treatment and disposal needs.
Contaminated Materials
Clean Earth’s operations are diversified across a variety of stable end markets focused primarily in the utilities, infrastructure and industrial industries. 
Dredged Material
Clean Earth has maintained a strong position in the New York and New Jersey harbors for its dredged material management and recycling services. Demand for Clean Earth’s services has grown such that it constructed a second dredge processing facility in 2009. Outside of the New York and New Jersey harbors, increased demand for maintenance projects is expected to be driven largely by the increasing size of heavy shipping vessels and expansion of the Panama Canal. As waterways are deepened, sediment accumulates in greater volume, which must be regularly removed to maintain the new depth. 
Hazardous Waste
Clean Earth maintains unique hazardous waste operations in an active region of the United States. There is a significant number of hazardous waste generators in the U.S. that are located in New York and New Jersey and Clean Earth operates one of the two commercial RCRA Part B permitted TSDFs in the New York metro area. Clean Earth is currently 
52

able to accept hazardous liquids, solids and gasses, as well as a variety of other specialty waste classes, including lab-packs, electronic waste, universal waste, wastewater, household hazardous waste, medical waste, used oils and antifreeze. Clean Earth can also accept nonhazardous waste at this facility. In addition to its hazardous waste facility in New Jersey, Clean Earth also operates RCRA Part B facilities in Calvert City, KY, Morgantown, WV, Glencoe, AL, Doraville, GA and Charlotte, NC.
Increasing share in existing markets
Clean Earth has historically increased the volume of materials processed at its existing facilities by expanding the scope of its existing permits and developing new treatment and processing techniques. The permitting expertise of its environmental, health, and safety organization allows Clean Earth to be proactive in seeking additional waste streams and adaptable to changing contaminants found in the materials it manages, as well as in newly regulated materials. 
Numerous dynamics have made the market increasingly beneficial for Clean Earth in its core markets. These dynamics include stricter regulations, increasing levels of enforcement and a more discerning customer base. 
Accelerating participation in increasingly regulated end markets 
Within its current footprint, there are opportunities for Clean Earth to continue to expand the scope of its service offering by adding additional specialty waste streams. 
Continued tuck-in acquisition growth
Since 2011, Clean Earth has expanded its footprint and technical capabilities by launching operations in Florida (acquired), the Marcellus Shale (greenfield), Georgia (acquired), Kentucky (acquired), West Virginia (acquired), Greater Washington, D.C. region (acquired and repurposed) Connecticut (acquired), Alabama (acquired), California (acquired), Virginia (acquired), New Hampshire (acquired), upstate New York (acquired), Pennsylvania (acquired), and North Carolina (acquired) and Michigan (acquired).
The market for waste management services is highly fragmented, with many companies operating a single facility. Accordingly, there are many tuck-in acquisition opportunities in Clean Earth’s marketplace that would enable it to continue growing in existing and adjacent markets, as well as in new geographies. 
Platform expansion opportunities
While Clean Earth has historically remained focused on its core markets, many opportunities exist to diversify and augment its environmental service offering using Clean Earth as a platform. Clean Earth can acquire select competitors and industrial services companies, as well as pursue vertical integration prospects and new treatment technologies. 
Customers
Clean Earth serves approximately 1,700 customers at more than 6,300 discrete sites. The Company maintains strong relationships with customers at various levels of the decision and supply chain, including public and private corporations and property owners, as well as environmental consultants, brokers, construction firms, municipalities, and regulatory agencies, among others. 
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the top 10 customers accounted for approximately 27%, 29% and 27% of net sales, respectively. While Clean Earth works with certain customers that have recurring needs for disposal and recycling solutions, its revenue per customer changes frequently. 
Seasonality
Clean Earth typically has lower earnings in the winter months due to limits on outdoor construction due to colder weather and dredging due to environmental restrictions in certain waterways in the Northeastern United States.
Sales and Marketing
Clean Earth’s team is comprised of sales and marketing professionals that are primarily focused on direct selling to customers. Clean Earth is focused on servicing customers at various levels of the decision and supply chain, including waste generators, environmental service companies, consultants, construction and engineering firms, commercial developers, municipalities and government-sponsored organizations, and regulatory agencies, among others. Clean Earth has spent years developing direct relationships with its clients, many of whom routinely generate large volumes of waste and demand treatment and disposal solutions at various sites and locations. 
Hazardous waste treatment services are managed both directly with generators and through broker networks.
53

The large dredging contractors manage the vast majority of the dredging activity. Clean Earth has built relationships with these contractors to ensure it is well-positioned to serve as many of the large or small dredging projects in the New York/New Jersey harbor and surrounding waterways, as possible. 
Competition
Competitive Landscape
The environmental services market is highly fragmented with numerous participants. However, a majority of these companies specialize in a narrower scope of services or treatment capabilities. Industry competitors relevant to Clean Earth’s served markets range from large public companies to small, single-service participants. Competition primarily includes processors of contaminated soils, dredging companies (to a limited extent), waste treatment providers and waste management companies. In Clean Earth’s core markets, competition tends to be primarily comprised of regional services providers or single-service companies with limited scale. Given these dynamics, we believe the industry will likely favor players such as Clean Earth that have large scale and management teams with many years of experience and extensive familiarity with the regulatory landscape.
Barriers to Entry

• | Permits - Clean Earth maintains an extensive portfolio of regulatory permits, including approximately 220 active permits and 200 permit modifications. Each facility maintains various local, state, and federal authorizations for the acceptance, treatment, and beneficial reuse of a wide variety of hazardous and nonhazardous materials, as well as all necessary air and water discharge permits required for operation. These permits are extremely difficult to obtain due to the complex navigation of multiple layers of regulation, lengthy and costly public review periods and typical public NIMBY opposition. Clean Earth maintains a large team of environmental, health and safety experts that have developed trusted relationships and credibility with local, state and federal regulatory agencies over the last 25 years.


• | Extensive Network - Clean Earth’s extensive network of permitted facilities is strategically located near major waste generation centers with an abundance of regulations governing waste treatment and disposal. Given transportation costs, the proximity of Clean Earth’s facilities to key markets and convenient access to rail, barge, and trucking transportation are significant competitive advantages that drive profitability. Furthermore, its maintenance of multiple backend beneficial reuse sites provides flexibility to direct volume to the most appropriate facilities based on available processing and placement capacity.

Regulatory Environment
Clean Earth’s facility operations are subject to various local, state, and federal authorizations for the acceptance, treatment, and beneficial reuse of a wide variety of hazardous and nonhazardous materials, as well as all necessary air and water discharge permits required for operation. These permits are extremely difficult to obtain due to the complex navigation of multiple layers of regulation, lengthy and costly public review periods, and typical public NIMBY opposition. Clean Earth maintains a large team of environmental, health, and safety experts that have developed trusted relationships and credibility with local, state, and federal regulatory agencies over the last 25 years.

Foam Fabricators
Overview
Foam Fabricators, headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, is a designer and manufacturer of custom molded protective foam solutions and OEM components made from expanded polystyrene (EPS) and other expanded polymers. Foam Fabricators provides products to a variety of end-markets, including appliances and electronics, pharmaceuticals, health and wellness, automotive, building products and others. Foam Fabricators’ molded foam solutions offer shock and vibration protection, surface protection, temperature control, resistance to water absorption and vapor transmission and other protective properties critical for shipping small, delicate items, heavy equipment or temperature-sensitive goods. Foam Fabricators operates 13 molding and fabricating facilities across North America, creating a geographic footprint of strategically located manufacturing plants to efficiently serve national customer accounts.
History of Foam Fabricators
Foam Fabricators was founded in 1957 and began its operations as a single plant in St. Louis, MO, dedicated to the manufacture of rigid foam plastics. In 1959, Foam Fabricators expanded its product range to include ice chests, packaging and swim toys. In the 1970s and 1980s, Foam Fabricators expanded its geographic footprint, adding six more shape molding plants. In 1983, Texstyrene Plastics, a publicly-traded competitor and manufacturer of polystyrene products, acquired Foam Fabricators. Shortly thereafter, Foam Fabricators added three new plants to its operation.
In 1989, Texstyrene split off its various business divisions and sold Foam Fabricators to the then current management team of Texstyrene. Through the 1990s and early 2000s, Foam Fabricators grew partially through acquisitions purchasing four competitors. Foam Fabricators also opened two greenfield plants in Mexico to better serve their multinational manufacturing customers. Today, Foam Fabricators operates out of its corporate headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona and 13 manufacturing facilities across North America. 
We purchased Foam Fabricators on February 15, 2018.
Industry
Foam Fabricators competes in the broadly defined global protective packaging market which was valued at $23.5 billion in 2017. On the basis of product type, this market is segmented into rigid protective, flexible protective, and foam protective applications. Foam Fabricators primarily competes in the North American foam protective packaging market which was valued at $6.2 billion in 2017 and includes expanded polyurethane foams, loose fills, foam in place polyurethane, and molded foams products. Producers of molded foam products generally fall into two categories: block molders and shape molders. Block molders manufacture large blocks of EPS foam that are typically used as insulation in building products such as walls, roofs and floors and are closely tied to the construction market. Shape molders, such as Foam Fabricators, manufacture customized molded foam solutions for protective packaging applications, insulated shipping containers and internal parts and components for OEMs. Products made of EPS foam have broad applications across various end markets due to a unique combination of performance characteristics. The superior cushioning and barrier properties paired with insulating and hydrophobic properties make it an ideal material for protective packaging of heavy or valuable goods as well as insulated shipping containers for temperature and moisture sensitive products. 
Products and Services
Foam Fabricators designs and manufactures a broad array of custom molded protective foam solutions and OEM components serving various end markets. Foam Fabricators’ molded foam products are predominately made of expandable polystyrene (EPS), which is a rigid, closed-cell foam. EPS is comprised of polystyrene, a thermoplastic derived from the styrene monomer and benzene, and an added expansion agent, usually pentane. The final shape mold finished product is 98% air and is created in a low-pressure press which heats EPS beads that expand and fill a customer-specific mold. Foam Fabricators also uses other moldable materials including expandable polypropylene (EPP) and expandable polyethylene (EPE) depending on project and customer requirements. EPS foam is an environmentally friendly material that is fully recyclable, uses less energy to produce, generates fewer emissions and has less environmental impact than most competitive material options.
Foam Fabricators’ custom-engineered molded foam products fall into four major categories: protective packaging, insulated shipping containers, OEM parts and componentry and fabricated foam. These products are used across a variety of end markets including consumer electronics, appliances, temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals and food, automotive, home and office furnishings and building products among others. 
55

Protective Packaging - Foam Fabricators creates custom molded corner pads, edge pads, “clear-view” packages and other protective foam packaging solutions for durable goods such as large and counter-top appliances, furniture, consumer electronics and military applications. Molded foam is an ideal protective packaging choice because it can be shaped into almost any form at tight tolerances and provides lightweight yet strong cushioning during product shipment. 
Insulated Shipping Containers - Transporting healthcare and pharmaceutical products requires complex logistical processes, specific equipment, storage facilities and special handling procedures to maintain product integrity. These requirements make EPS foam an ideal material to be used in insulated shipping containers due to its thermal insulation, water impermeability and shock absorbing properties. Similar to its uses in the healthcare industry, Foam Fabricators manufactures insulated shipping containers for online grocers and meal delivery services to transport prepared meals and perishable food and beverage products that must be shipped in a temperature-controlled environment. 
OEM Parts and Componentry - Foam Fabricators manufactures a variety of internal components used by OEMs as replacements for injection molded plastic or sheet metal parts across various end-markets. Compared to traditional plastic parts, foam offers vibration protection, insulation benefits, lower tooling costs and shorter lead times. Foam Fabricators offers thin-wall molded air ducts and other internal components for household appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners. In the automotive sector, Foam Fabricators manufactures foam door panels, trunk liners, bumper components, instrument panels, center consoles, side pillars, seat components and head rests. Foam is increasingly being used in new vehicle designs because it offers equivalent impact strength and toughness to traditional chassis materials with 10 to 40% less weight. Foam Fabricators also makes products used in personal watercraft floatation and seating parts as well as recreational vehicle roof panels and core laminates that go underneath aluminum outer skins. Lastly, Foam Fabricators produces building products for the construction market including insulated concrete forms. Insulated concrete forms are hollow sections of molded foam that construction crews stack into the shape of the walls of a building and fill with concrete to create the permanent structure.
Fabricated Foam - Foam Fabricators also uses a variety of methods including die cutting, saw cutting, hot wire slicing and pressure cutting to create fabricated foam shapes as opposed to molded shapes. These products do not require tooling or dies so there is less upfront costs for the customer and are usually best suited for medium to low volume projects. Fabricated foam products represent a small portion of Foam Fabricators overall net sales.
Competitive Strengths
National Scale and Proximity to Customers - Foam Fabricators maintains a national footprint of 13 manufacturing locations across North America. Facilities are strategically located near customers’ production locations enabling Foam Fabricators to be one of only a few foam molders capable of serving large national accounts. Due to foam’s high volume-to-weight ratio, foam manufacturers generally confine product shipments to a 300-mile radius in which shipping costs are economically viable. Thus, Foam Fabricators is uniquely positioned to provide multi-facility support to its largest customers who often have multiple manufacturing or distribution locations. 
Engineering and Design Capabilities - Foam Fabricators has five coordinated design and testing centers with experienced packaging and mechanical engineers that work closely with customers to support packaging design needs. Engineering services include optimizing molds to meet customer needs and address complex design requirements, identifying pre-manufacturing challenges, solving post-manufacturing issues, improving packaging processes and laboratory testing final designs. Early customer involvement and collaboration to develop packaging solutions has resulted in increased project win rates and better visibility into product development pipelines. 
Barriers to Entry 

• | High Customer Switching Costs - The operational risk and disruption associated with switching existing molds to operate on a competitor’s press makes shifting or splitting business between different shape molders difficult and infrequent. In general, most customers pay for their own molds, which are custom built for a specific molders’ presses. The financial cost of retooling is estimated to be $5,000 - $25,000 per mold, making it cost prohibitive to change molders on existing projects.


• | Favorable Cost-to-value Proposition - The high cost of failure, relatively low proportionate cost of foam to the final product being protected, and sometimes lengthy testing and qualification process represent significant barriers to customers changing solution providers or packaging material choices.


• | Equipment and Processing Infrastructure - Foam Fabricators’ existing base of production equipment has a significant estimated replacement cost. Management estimates the cost of opening a new shape molding

facility at approximately $5 million, excluding real estate, and must meet stringent environmental standards. A new entrant could require as much as 1-2 years of lead time to match the process performance requirements, customization of equipment and material formulations necessary to effectively compete in the molded foam industry. Moreover, Foam Fabricators has a strong preventive maintenance program and in-house equipment division that is responsible for repairing and rebuilding presses. This allows Foam Fabricators to significantly extend the average useful life of its machinery and reduce the ongoing capital investment requirements, creating an advantage over competitors. 
Business Strategies
Defend Market Position - As a leading supplier of custom molded foam solutions, management believes Foam Fabricators enjoys strong brand awareness and a reputation for superior quality and service in the industry. In a market characterized by fragmented competition, Foam Fabricators will continue to focus on providing a best in class suite of products and capabilities. 
Remain Committed to Customers - Functional and error-free products are key considerations for its customers and Foam Fabricators has maintained a disciplined approach to ensure its products meet the highest standard of quality. Utilizing a balanced scorecard, Foam Fabricators has achieved a 99.0% 1st piece acceptance rate, less than 2 complaints per 1000 shipments and a less than 0.05% rejection rate. As a result of this system of checks, Foam Fabricators has had little customer attrition. 
Pursue Selective Acquisitions - Foam Fabricators views acquisitions as a potentially attractive means to expand its national footprint or broaden its current product offering. Management will continue to seek tuck-in acquisitions of regional foam molders and other packaging suppliers where sales and operational efficiencies can be realized, or to diversify into packaging products other than molded foam. 
Customers 
Foam Fabricators maintains a broad base of over 300 customers across a wide variety of end-markets, including appliances, pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, consumer electronics, automotive, furniture, building products and logistics. Foam Fabricators’ products are sold primarily direct to the customer or through third-party packaging distributors. Foam Fabricators has maintained long-standing relationships with its top customers, often averaging ten or more years. Foam Fabricators three largest customers comprised approximately 40%, 37%, 35% of sales in the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Foam Fabricators often maintains resin cost pass-through provisions with its contracted customers, allowing them to pass-through material resin price changes - resin constitutes their primary raw material cost.
The following table sets forth Foam Fabricator's customer breakdown by sector for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:

Sales and Marketing
Foam Fabricators sales and marketing efforts are decentralized and generally carried out by one or two full-time salespeople who are typically also engineers at each of the manufacturing facilities. The dedicated sales team report to regional managers and vice presidents, who are collectively responsible for driving overall sales activities in their respective markets. Key customer accounts are directly managed by senior management, who coordinate efforts between manufacturing facilities to fulfill orders.

Foam Fabricators spends less than 1% of net sales each year on traditional marketing, which consists of targeted brochure advertising and maintaining its website which new customers use to make product inquiries.
Manufacturing and Distribution
Foam Fabricators maintains 13 manufacturing facilities across North America with 11 located in the U.S. and two in Mexico, as well as one non-manufacturing corporate headquarters. Given the high volume, low density nature of foam, Foam Fabricators’ manufacturing facilities are strategically located near its largest customers’ production locations to minimize freight and logistics costs. Foam Fabricators geographic footprint covers a large portion of the continental U.S. and Mexico. Each plant has a warehouse space for raw materials, supplies and finished goods. Several plants also use third-party warehousing to store excess inventory. Foam Fabricators uses common carriers to deliver finished product and in certain cases, some customers pick up directly from the plants.
Suppliers
The primary raw materials that are used in production are plastic resins, such as expandable polystyrene (EPS), expandable polypropylene (EPP) and expandable polyethylene (EPE). In addition to plastic resins, Foam Fabricators also purchases fabricating material including blocks of EPE and EPP foam, polyethylene and urethane, as well as other packaging materials including corrugate, boxes, paperboard, tape and plastic film. Foam Fabricators purchases its materials from a combination of domestic and foreign suppliers and has maintained strong relationships with key resin suppliers for over 30 years. Adequate amounts of all raw materials have been available in the past, and Foam Fabricators’ management believes this will continue in the foreseeable future. 
Regulatory Environment
Foam Fabricators’ manufacturing operations and facilities are subject to federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. These include laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharge and the storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous materials. Management believes that Foam Fabricators is in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, Foam Fabricators employed 563 full-time employees in 14 locations. None of Foam Fabricators’ U.S.-based employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Under Mexican Federal Labor Law, 137 employees at the two Mexican manufacturing facilities are unionized. Foam Fabricators believes its relationship with its employees is good.

History of Sterno 
Sterno’s history dates back to 1893 when S. Sternau & Co. began making chafing dishes and coffee percolators in Tenafly, New Jersey. In 1914, S. Sternau & Co. introduced “canned heat” with the launch of its gelled ethanol product under the “Sterno” brand. Since then, the Sternau and Sterno names have been the most well-known names in portable food warming fuel. In 1917, S. Sternau & Co. was renamed The Sterno Corporation. During World War I, Sterno portable stoves were promoted as an essential gift for soldiers going to fight in the trenches of Europe. Sterno stoves heated water and rations, sterilized surgical instruments, and provided light and warmth in bunkers and foxholes. During World War II, Sterno produced ethanol and methanol chafing fuels under contract with the U.S. military. Sterno's production facilities were moved from New Jersey to Texarkana, Texas in the early 1980s. In 2012, Sterno merged with the Candle Lamp Company, LLC ("CandleLamp"). CandleLamp was founded in Riverside, California in 1978, focusing initially on the liquid wax candle market. Over the next several decades, CandleLamp began to supply chafing fuel in addition to lighting products. We purchased Sterno on October 10, 2014.
In January 2016, Sterno expanded their product offering with the acquisition of Northern International Inc. ("Sterno Home"). Sterno Home was formed in 1997 by its three founding partners who had been in the import and product development business since 1979. The success in the outdoor lighting an innovative use of LED technology evolved into the development of patented flameless candle product line. Sterno Home's flameless candle evolved the battery operated candle market from a functional safety oriented product into an attractive décor piece meant to enhance the beauty of consumer’s homes. 
In February 2018, Sterno acquired Rimports. Rimports is a manufacturer and distributor of branded and private label wickless candle products used for home decor and fragrance systems under the ScentSationals, Better Home & Garden, AmbiEscents, Oak & Rye, Estate and Ador brands. Rimports offers unique lines of wickless candle products including ceramic wax warmers, scented wax cubes and essential oil and diffusers. 
Today, Sterno operates out of its corporate headquarters in Corona California, two manufacturing facilities in Texarkana, Texas and Memphis, Tennessee, and the Rimports facility in Provo, Utah.
Industry 
Sterno Products competes in the broadly defined U.S. foodservice industry where restaurant, catering and hospitality sales account for approximately 67% of the market with the remainder comprised of the travel and leisure, education and healthcare related sales. The Sterno Products product offerings focus on safe, portable fire solutions for cooking and warming, as well as tabletop lighting décor. 
Sterno Home competes in the outdoor lighting and home decor industry. Sterno Home's sales are concentrated in the United States and Canada, with a small percentage of sales coming through global retailers with locations in Japan, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and Australia. Management believes that a rise in demand from high-income households and businesses will bolster growth, with consumers spending more money on the cocooning trend and specifically on beautifying their indoor and outdoor home, changing out trendy accent items more frequently and investing in more spacious and comfortable outdoor spaces with many equivalent amenities of their indoor spaces.
Rimports operates in the broad U.S. home decor space (retail) which is heavily correlated to general consumer spending. Flameless and reusable wax products have seen increased adoption by younger consumers who prioritize economical and environmentally friendly products. Within the home decor space, Rimports competes in the U.S. candle space and the U.S. home fragrance space. 
Products and Services
Sterno is a “full-line” supplier offering a broad array of portable chafing fuels, table lighting, outdoor lighting products, wickless candles and fragrance products with approximately 4000 SKUs serving the foodservice and retail markets. Sterno originally focused on chafing fuel (“canned heat”) products and later expanded its offerings to include table ambiance products such as liquid wax, wax candles and votive lamp, as well as outdoor lighting with the acquisition of Sterno Home in 2016, and wax cubes and warmer products through its acquisition of Rimports. Sterno’s products fall into six major categories: canned heat, catering equipment and butane products, table lighting, flameless candles and outdoor lighting, wickless candle and fragrance products.
Canned Heat - The canned heat product line is composed of various chafing fuels packaged in small, portable cans. The portable warming (canned heat) line is composed of wick-based and gel-based chafing fuels packaged in steel cans. These products are used by foodservice professionals in a variety of food serving and holding applications and are designed to keep food products at an optimal food-safe serving temperature of 140-165 Fahrenheit. The canned 
59

heat product line is composed of two subcategories: wick chafing fuel and gel chafing fuel. The subcategories are distinguished based on the type of chafing fuel being used; the four primary chafing fuels are diethylene glycol (“DEG”), propylene glycol, ethanol and methanol. Each fuel contains unique characteristics and properties that allow the Company to offer a broad array of configurations to suit varying user requirements.
Wick Chafing Fuel
The wick chafing fuel line (“Wick”) is composed of either DEG or propylene glycol chafing fuel. DEG and propylene glycol chafing fuels with advance wick technology have higher heat output than alternatives such as ethanol and methanol. The liquid Wick products feature a variety of wick types and burn times to meet the specific needs of the user. Wick fuels are clean burning, biodegradable, nonflammable if spilled (will not ignite without a wick) and the can stays cool to the touch when lit.
Gel Chafing Fuel
The gel chafing fuel line (“Gel”) is composed of either gelled ethanol or gelled methanol chafing fuel. Ethanol chafing fuel has a higher heat output than methanol fuel; both ethanol and methanol fuels have lower heat output than some DEG and propylene glycol products. The Gel product line tends to have shorter burn times than the Wick product.
For an Environmentally preferred chafing fuel, the Company offers a patented line of “Green” chafing fuels featuring USDA Certified Biobased Product formulas that are also endorsed by the Green Restaurant Association. The “Green Heat” and “Green Wick” products perform similar to the Wick and Gel chafing fuels, but are made from renewable resources that are biodegradable and more environmentally friendly.
Catering Equipment - Catering equipment products are designed to provide a complete commercial catering solution whether indoor or outdoor. Products include chafing dish frames and lids, wind guards and buffet sets.
Butane - Sterno produces a full line of professional quality portable butane stoves, ideal for action stations, made-to-order omelet lines, tableside and off-site cooking, outdoor events and more. Products also include select butane accessories for special culinary applications such as the culinary torch. Sterno butane fuel comes with an additional safety feature called Countersink Release Vent (CRV) Technology.
Table Lighting - Sterno sells a variety of items designed to enhance lighting and ambiance at meal settings which are critical to a customer’s experience. Products include liquid wax, traditional hard wax and flameless electronic candles, as well as votive lamps, shaded lamps and accent lamps.
Flameless Candles and Outdoor Lighting - Through Sterno Home, Sterno offers a wide selection of lighting for your home, garden, patio and yard with over 1000 SKUS available in our retail markets. Sterno Home first delved into lighting with lighting fixtures for illuminating front and backyard pathways. Sterno Home quickly expanded its line to include other types of home lighting products, most notably bollards, shepherd hook lights and line voltage powered coach lights and street lights. Sterno Home’s 20-year history of providing high quality, low cost consumer-directed lighting has cemented it as a top tier supplier in both the flameless candle and outdoor lighting categories. All of Sterno Home’s products are powered by one of the following:

• | Solar - solar panel with rechargeable power source - usually a rechargeable battery


• | Battery - battery operated


• | Plug-in - plugs directly into a regular wall socket either with 2 or 3 prong plug and with or without included and attached transformer


• | Low Voltage - part of a set which includes a stand-alone transformer. Fixtures connect through a stand-alone wire via clip connectors


• | Line Voltage - hardwired into a home's electrical circuitry


• | Rechargeable - product is recharged when empty usually through a plug in wire and an onboard rechargeable power source

Flameless Candles
The flameless candle product line is made up of various types and sizes of candles with all of them sharing the one main attribute: their glow is powered by an artificial power source, most often battery. This makes them inherently safer than traditional candles as there is no flame or even heat generated to cause any type of accidents. Although pillar type candles are the most common shape, Sterno Home also designs and manufactures votives, tealights, tapers as well as specialty molded candles. Sterno Home was also the first to introduce the timer function to their flameless candle line. Sterno Home’s candles stand out from the competition as they are the only manufacturer that offers the 
60

patented black wick. Sterno Home also developed its unique algorithm-based light circuit which gives the candle a naturally random flicker and glow.
Landscape Lighting 
The landscape lighting category was Sterno Home’s first offering. Starting with simple low voltage path lights, Sterno Home quickly expanded its offering to reflect the growing needs of the DIY and home décor consumer. Landscape lighting is lighting that promotes and accentuates elements of a consumer’s home, yard or garden so its beauty can be enjoyed both in daytime and nighttime. Another benefit of landscape lighting is added safety as it is easier to navigate around a home at night when it is reasonably well-lit. Landscape lighting was originally most commonly powered through a low voltage setup but as solar technologies have rapidly developed, many of these fixtures can achieve their lighting purposes with only a solar panel as power generation. Consumers with higher and more consistent lighting requirements most often opt for low voltage kits using wire and transformers to light their fixtures. Solar powered fixtures are advantageous for those consumers looking for cheaper and quicker to set up lighting solutions even if it often means lesser lumens and light. Another notable technology has been the development of LED lighting. LED’s more efficient power generation technology has allowed for advantageous fixture designs and a higher level of power generation which were not easy or as cost effective to achieve as with legacy lighting technologies such as incandescent or halogen. LEDs also last longer and are generally more robust than older technologies. 
Décor Lighting
Décor lighting is Sterno Home’s newest category. Décor lighting has similar functions to landscape lighting but is usually less about safety and functionality and more about accenting an area of the outside home with ornamentation of some sort. With a décor piece, the light the piece gives off and the item itself together become elements of beauty in the setting. Because these items are very trend driven, consumers are more apt to switch them out more often therefore increasing repeat purchase potential and other recurrent sales opportunities for Sterno Home. Some of the most common categories of décor lighting are lanterns and baskets and string lighting.
Wickless Candle and Fragrance Products 
WaxWarmers and Scented Wax Cubes
The wax and wax warmer line is composed of a large variety of fragrance and warmer design choices for consumers. The wax cubes are long-lasting and consistently release strong fragrance. The consumer likes the product because the scented wax cubes are an impulse item ($2~ price range) and this product makes it easy and quick for the customer to change fragrance. The flameless feature is a plus in that it is very safe. The proprietary formula and world-class fragrances add to the high quality of the domestically-made products. Ongoing research ensures consumer loyalty, superior quality, and well-rounded fragrance programs. The wax warmers are made up of quality materials including wood, metal, ceramic, and glass.
Essential Oils and Diffusers
The 100% Pure Essential Oil lines and brands consists of Peppermint, Lavender, Lemon, Eucalyptus, Sweet Orange, Grapefruit, Tea tree, Cinnamon, etc. Customers are attracted to high quality, 100 percent pure oil products with no additives or fillers. Attractively designed diffusers appeal to consumers in the Aromatherapy Home Fragrance section.
ScentCharms
ScentCharms is Rimports’ newest product category. With various interchangeable high-quality fragrance oils and plug-in designs, consumers enjoy a personalized experience. The product is designed to be no spill, no mess, clutter-free, and long-lasting.
Aromatherapy Products
The aromatherapy line consists of room sprays, liquid hand soaps, foaming hand soaps, hand sanitizers, body lotions, and body scrubs, etc. The five unique fragrance combinations - lavender and chamomile, eucalyptus and rosemary, orange and vanilla, lemon and grapefruit, and peppermint and geranium - are made with 100 percent pure essential oils.

Competitive Strengths 
Leading Brand Recognition & Market Share - Sterno Products is the market share leader in the canned chafing fuel market. Management believes Sterno Products enjoys outstanding brand awareness and a reputation for superior quality and performance with distributors, caterers, hotels and other end users. Sterno Home offers a wide variety of products to a cross section of North American retail and our diversity gives us a unique standing in this marketplace. Most of Stern Home's competitors specialize in one aspect of fulfilling the market. They either only sell to a few retailers or only actively develop few or even only one category of product. This exposes them to major financial challenges when they lose that account or when that product is beat out by a competitor or starts to wane in the marketplace. Rimports is the market share leader in fragrance systems, particularly the wickless candle market, and growing in the essential oils and diffusers and plug-in liquid fragrance markets. Rimports offers a large variety of products to retailers in North America, Canada, China, and the United Kingdom.
Low Cost versus Alternatives - Sterno Product's customers are typically caterers, hotels or restaurants who utilize canned chafing fuel to maintain prepared food at a safe and enjoyable serving temperature. The risk of ruining a dining experience and the low proportionate cost of canned chafing fuel relative to the cost of a catered event represent significant barriers to customers switching out of Sterno’s canned chafing fuel products. Additionally, management believes that there is no other technology available today that offers the portability, reliability and low cost of the Sterno canned chafing fuel products. Rimports’ ultimate consumers seek high quality products in the Home Fragrance section. This high value strength ensures consumer loyalty and satisfaction.
