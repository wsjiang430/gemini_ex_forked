 Item 1. Business.
Throughout this section, references to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Alight and its consolidated subsidiaries as the context so requires.
 Alight is defining the future of employee wellbeing through the power of our integrated health, wealth, wellbeing and payroll solutions powered by Alight Worklife®. Alight Worklife® is a high-tech employee engagement platform with a human touch – that brings together our mission-critical wellbeing solutions to our clients to drive better outcomes for organizations and individuals. 
Against the current macro environment, both employers and employees face considerable challenges that impact their ability to succeed and thrive now and in the future. Employees are shouldering more and more responsibility for healthcare costs, while struggling with short-and-long-term financial needs in an inflationary environment, among other daily challenges. These trends have driven the need for integrated, personalized tools to help employees make more informed decisions around all aspects of their health, finances and wellbeing. For their part, employers are facing increasing cost pressures, ever-changing workforce regulations and evolving dynamics across the employer/employee relationship, driving the need for flexibility, engagement and effective solutions for compliance. We believe Alight is uniquely positioned between the employer and employee to address these factors and drive better outcomes for both.
 We aim to be the pre-eminent employee experience partner by providing personalized experiences that help employees make the best decisions for themselves and their families about their health, wealth and wellbeing. At the same time, we help employers tackle their biggest people and business challenges by helping them understand prevalence, trends and risks to generate better outcomes for the future and realize a return on their people investment. Our data, analytics and Artificial Intelligence ("AI") allow us to deliver actionable insights that drive measurable outcomes for companies and their people. We provide solutions to manage health and retirement benefits, tools for payroll and HR management, as well as solutions to manage the workforce from the cloud. Our solutions include:
 Employer Solutions: driven by our digital, software and AI-led capabilities powered by the Alight Worklife® platform and spanning total employee wellbeing, including integrated benefits administration, healthcare navigation, financial wellbeing, leave of absence management, retiree healthcare and payroll. We leverage data across all interactions and activities to improve the employee experience, reduce operational costs and better inform management processes and decision-making. Our clients' employees benefit from an integrated platform and user experience, coupled with a full-service customer care center, helping them manage the full life cycle of their health, wealth and careers.
 Professional Services: includes our project-based cloud deployment and consulting offerings that provide expertise with both human capital and financial platforms. Specifically, this includes cloud advisory and deployment, and optimization services for cloud platforms such as Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle, and Cornerstone OnDemand.
We deliver our solutions through a set of proprietary and partner technologies, a well-developed network of providers and a structured approach to instill and sustain enterprise-wide practices of excellence. Our solutions are supported through a secure and scalable cloud infrastructure, together with our core benefits processing platforms and consumer engagement tools and integrated with over 350 external platforms and partners. Our data and access across the breadth of human capital solutions provides us with comprehensive employee records to enable AI-driven, omnichannel engagement and a personalized, integrated experience for our clients’ employees. Through the use of predictive analytics and omnichannel engagement, Alight is able to tailor an employee experience that is unique to each individual’s needs and circumstance.
 We generate primarily all of our revenue, which is highly recurring, from fees for services provided from contracts across all solutions, which is primarily based on a contracted fee charged per participant per period (e.g., monthly or annually, as applicable). Our contracts typically have three to five-year terms for ongoing services with mutual renewal options. The majority of our revenue is recognized over time when control of the promised services is transferred, and the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of our services. Payment terms are consistent with industry practice.
 We use annual revenue retention rates as some of the measures to manage our business. We calculate annual revenue retention by identifying the clients from whom we generate revenue in the prior year and determining what percentage of that revenue is generated from those same clients for the same solutions in the subsequent year.
 Principal Services and Segments
 We currently operate under three reportable segments, Employer Solutions, Professional Services and Hosted Business, which accounted for 87%, 12% and 1% of revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022.
 •Employer Solutions: driven by our digital, software and AI-led capabilities powered by the Alight Worklife® platform and spanning total employee wellbeing, including integrated benefits administration, healthcare navigation, financial 


wellbeing, leave of absence management, retiree healthcare and payroll. We leverage data across all interactions and activities to improve the employee experience, reduce operational costs and better inform management processes and decision-making. Our clients' employees benefit from an integrated platform and user experience, coupled with a full-service customer care center, helping them manage the full life cycle of their health, wealth and careers.
 •Professional Services: includes our project-based cloud deployment and consulting offerings that provide expertise with both human capital and financial platforms. Specifically, this includes cloud advisory and deployment, and optimization services for cloud platforms such as Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle, and Cornerstone OnDemand. 
 •Hosted Business: delivers core HR and payroll services on hosted human capital management platforms, including Oracle. These services include ongoing application hosting and management of on-premises human capital management software. 
 Technology
 We deliver our solutions through a set of proprietary and partner technologies, a well-developed network of providers and a structured approach to instill and sustain enterprise-wide practices of excellence. With this in mind, there are four layers to our technology strategy, all reinforced with a critical security framework:
•Omnichannel customer experience layer that drives a personalized approach for customers. 
 •AI and analytics layer that uses data from our transactional systems, combined with client and third-party data to drive insights for clients.
 •Core transaction layer that powers our health, wealth and payroll systems. 
 •Infrastructure layer to provide security, stability and performance across our application landscape. 
 Seasonality
 Due to buying patterns and delivery of certain products in the markets we serve, particularly given the timing of annual benefits enrollment, our revenues tend to be higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year.
Licensing and Regulation
 Our business activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under the laws of countries in which we operate, including United States (“U.S.”) federal and state laws. See the discussion contained in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.
Clients
 We serve a broad range of clients, including Fortune 500 companies and mid-market businesses, and seek to establish high-quality, strong, long-term relationships with our clients. We proactively solicit client feedback through ongoing surveys and client councils held throughout the year, and we use this critical feedback to enhance our client services and correct course when necessary. Through these surveys, we have learned that clients value the strength and depth of our relationships, scale and breadth of our solutions and our commitment to innovation and continuous improvement.
Competition
 The markets for our solutions are competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented. Our business faces competition from other global and national companies. The market for our solutions is subject to change as a result of economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, shifting client needs and increased competition from established and new competitors.
 We do not believe there is any single competitor with the breadth of our solutions, and thus our competitors vary for each of our solutions. Our primary competitors include Accenture, Accolade, ADP, bswift, Businessolver, Cognizant, Conduent, Deloitte, eHealth, Empower, Fidelity, GoHealth, Included Health, HealthEquity, Mercer, OneSource Virtual, Quantum Health, SD Worx, Voya, WTW, and Workday.
 We compete primarily on the basis of product and service quality, technology, breadth of offerings, ease of use and accessibility of technology, data protection, innovation, trust and reliability, price, and reputation.


Human Capital Management
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed more than 18,000 colleagues, approximately 67% of whom were located in the Americas, 18% were located in Europe, and 15% were located in Asia. In the United States, 66% of our colleagues identified as female and 41% of our colleagues self-identified as a minority group. We believe that our relations with our colleagues in all locations are positive.
 Attracting, developing, and retaining talent is critical to executing our strategy and our ability to compete effectively. We believe in the importance of creating a diverse and inclusive work environment for our colleagues, supporting their wellbeing with fair and market-competitive pay and benefits, and investing in their growth and development.
 We also value feedback from our colleagues and regularly survey them to understand how they feel about the company and subsequently take appropriate actions, if necessary, and employ employee engagement best practices to improve their work experience. Our efforts have resulted in being recognized as a Great Place to Work® for the fifth consecutive year and being listed among the top 100 companies for remote workers by Flexjobs.
 Inclusion and Diversity
At Alight, we know that we cannot improve others’ lives without first enriching our own employees’ wellbeing. Diversity, equity, and inclusion ("DE&I") is essential to creating a sense of belonging in the workplace, and to making Alight a place where all colleagues can feel happy and fulfilled while serving our clients and their people with excellence. Our people bring a diverse range of backgrounds and perspectives to the table, and that diversity is what helps us better serve the needs of all our customers. This includes race, ethnicity, age, citizenship status, education, income, skills, gender identity, sexual orientation, nationality, physical or cognitive ability, beliefs, upbringing, and lived experiences. We are committed to developing these diverse talents so we can become stronger and brighter together. To increase cross-cultural sharing and appreciation, we prioritize global recognition of cultures and heritage and provide inclusion training.
 In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and makes recommendations regarding the composition and size of our Board of Directors to ensure, among other things, that our Board of Director membership consists of persons with sufficiently diverse and independent backgrounds.
 Total Rewards
Our benefits are designed to help colleagues and their families stay healthy, meet their financial goals, protect their income and help them balance their work and personal lives. These benefits include health and wellness, paid time off, employee assistance, competitive pay, career growth opportunities, paid volunteer time, and a culture of recognition.
Growth and Development
 We understand that developing our talent is both critical for continuing success in a rapidly evolving environment and for colleague engagement and retention, and we are committed to actively fostering a learning culture and investing in ongoing professional and career development for our colleagues. We empower managers and employees with collective accountability for developing themselves and others, and promote ongoing dialogue, coaching, feedback, and improvement through our continuous performance management practices. We offer employees an extensive number of programs and tools for their personal and professional development including instructor-led training courses, leadership development programs, on-demand virtual learning, individual development planning, roles-based functional and technical training, compliance training, peer learning opportunities, and tuition reimbursement programs. We also aligned our talent and succession planning framework at a global level for our Director-level and above roles to support the development of our internal talent pipeline for current and future organizational needs, and to provide an overall health gauge of our global talent pool. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees and approves the management continuity planning process.
 Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property portfolio is primarily comprised of various copyrights (including copyrights in software) and trademarks, as well as certain trade secrets or proprietary know-how of our business. Our success has resulted in part from our proprietary methodologies, process and other intellectual property, such as certain of Alight's platforms.

 Our business relies on software provided by both internal development and external sourcing to deliver its services. With respect to internally developed software, we claim copyright on all such software, registering works where appropriate. We require all employees and contractors to assign to us the rights to works developed on our behalf. In addition, we rely on maintaining source code confidentiality to maintain our market competitiveness. With respect to externally sourced software, we rely on contracts to allow for

continued access for its business usage.
