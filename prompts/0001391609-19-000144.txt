ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Company History
 
The Company was incorporated on January 30, 2008, in the State of Florida, as Maximum Consulting, Inc. and shortly thereafter changed its name to ZhongSen International Tea Company, with the principal business objective of providing sales and marketing consulting services to small to medium sized Chinese tea producing companies who wish to export and distribute high quality Chinese tea products worldwide. The Company commenced business activities in August 2008, when it entered into a related party Sales and Marketing Agreement with Yunnan Zhongsen Group, Ltd. However, due to lack of capital, the Company was unable to implement its business plan fully. On May 31, 2013, the Company entered into an acquisition agreement (the “Acquisition”) with Music of Your Life, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“MYL Nevada”). As a result of the Acquisition, MYL Nevada is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company is now operating a multi-media entertainment company, producing television shows and radio programming. The Company changed its name to Music of Your Life, Inc. effective July 26, 2013.
 
The Company merged into The Marquie Group, Inc. on August 16, 2018, which was founded by Jacquie Carter prior to its merger with the Company . Jacquie Carter is a former Executive Director of Worldwide Training and Education at Herbalife Nutrition. During her 18 years with Herbalife, Jacquie created and launched over 60 products worldwide, which have accumulated more than $1-billion in sales.
 
Internet Licensing has transformed the advertising landscape in a way that is detrimental to advertising sales for terrestrial radio. In response to this, Music of Your Life and the Company began to explore developing a product line to be marketed through radio spots on the Company’s syndicated radio network. At the same time the Company was in an exploratory phase of developing amino-acid-based health and beauty care products. The Music of Your Life merged into the Company though Share Exchange Agreement in August 2018.
 
Acquisition of The Marquie Group, Inc.
 
On August 16, 2018 the Company merged with The Marquie Group, Inc. (“TMG”) in exchange for the issuance of a total of 100,000 shares of our common stock to TMG’s stockholders. Following the merger, the Company had 102,277 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. On December 5, 2018, the Company amended and restated its Articles of Incorporation providing for a change in the Company’s name from “Music of Your Life, Inc.” to “The Marquie Group, Inc.” On February 22, 2018 our FINRA symbol changed from “MYLI” to “TMGI.”

According to the Physician’s Desk Reference approximately 10-20% of vitamins and minerals taken in supplement form are actually absorbed by the body. Because of this low rate of absorption typical multi-vitamins are not enough for us to obtain the vital nutrients our bodies need. And especially not the skin. Our ultimate goal is to be able supply both topical, nutrient driven products as well as accompanying beauty drinks. This will allow for a wonderful synergy inside and out and will assure us that we are taking the necessary steps to protect our bodies and look good and feel good while doing it.

Competition
 
There are a few well-established companies selling health products containing CBD derived from hemp, and hundreds of new upstarts proposing virtually the same business model as the Company. However, many of these companies fail quickly, and the lack of regulatory guidelines has caused many of these companies unable to sell their products.
Employees
 
As of May 31, 2019, Marc Angell (Director and Chief Executive Officer) and Jacquie Carter (President) are non-employee officers and/or directors of the Company. The Company has no official employees. We currently have 4 on-air talent paid as part-time contractors, 1 part-time production person, an outside accountant, and an outside lawyer. Certain other executive positions have been identified, and we intend to fill these positions. Additional other support staff and other personnel will be hired when there is adequate capital available to do so.
 
We have undertaken preliminary investigations concerning candidates for the above positions and do not currently anticipate difficulty in filling such positions with qualified persons; however we cannot assure you that we will in fact be able to hire qualified persons for such positions when needed. Additional positions to be filled may be identified from time to time by the Company. We expect to be able to attract and retain such additional employees as are necessary, commensurate with the anticipated future expansion of our business. Further, we expect to continue to use consultants, contract labor, attorneys and accountants as necessary.
 
The loss of our CEO Marc Angell would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company. We intend to reduce this risk by obtaining key-man insurance in the event that affordable insurance coverage may be obtained. We cannot assure you that the Company will be able to obtain such insurance or that the Company will be successful in recruiting needed personnel.
