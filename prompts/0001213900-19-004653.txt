Summary
 
ImmuCell Corporation was founded in 1982 and completed an initial public offering of common stock in 1987. After achieving approval from the Center for Veterinary Biologics, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to sell First Defense® in 1991, we focused most of our efforts during the 1990’s attempting to develop human product applications of the underlying milk protein purification technology. Beginning in 1999, we re-focused our business strategy on the First Defense® product line and other products that improve the health and productivity of dairy and beef cattle. The demand for animal protein, that must be produced efficiently while ensuring food quality and safety, increases as the human population grows. Further, our products help address the growing human health concern about using less antibiotics in food-producing animals. We aim to capitalize on the growth in sales of the First Defense® product line (a product that provides significant Immediate Immunity™ to newborn dairy and beef livestock) and to revolutionize the mastitis treatment paradigm with Re-Tain™ (formerly Mast Out®), a product we are developing to treat this most significant cause of economic loss to the dairy industry.

During 2000, we began the development of Re-Tain™, our purified Nisin treatment for subclinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows. No sales of this product can be made without prior approval of our New Animal Drug Application (NADA) by the Center for Veterinary Medicine, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We have now achieved FDA approval for four out of five of the significant regulatory submissions required for product approval. Regulatory achievements to date have significantly reduced the product development risks in the areas of safety and effectiveness. Our primary product development focus has now turned to completion of the manufacturing objectives required for FDA approval.
 
Since 2006, we have made ongoing efforts to maintain compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations in all of our manufacturing operations, which requires a sustained investment that further enhances the quality of all of our products and our operating efficiency. As we make process improvements, we continue to invest in personnel, equipment and facility modifications to increase the efficiency and quality of our operations.
 
To provide a portion of the funding needed for the development of Re-Tain™ and expansion of the First Defense® product line, we issued an aggregate of 2,401,497 shares of common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $13.46 million in four separate transactions during 2017 and 2016. In order to minimize the dilutive effects of these transactions on our existing stockholders, we chose not to issue any form of convertible or preferred securities and issued these common shares without any warrants. During 2017 and 2016, we also secured approximately $6.8 million in new debt. We have invested this new capital to complete the development of Re-Tain™ without relying on funding from a partner or licensee, thereby keeping control over all product rights and potential revenues.
 
Our operations have been generally profitable, except when we have elected to make unusually large investments in product development expenses for future growth. During the twenty years in which we have focused on products for the dairy and beef industries, we have funded our operations and improved our net financial position, as demonstrated in the following table (in thousands, except for percentages):

The First Defense® product line is manufactured from hyperimmune cows’ colostrum (the antibody rich milk that a cow produces immediately after giving birth) utilizing our proprietary vaccine and milk protein purification technologies. The First Defense® product line provides bovine antibodies that newborn calves need but are unable to produce on their own immediately after birth. The target disease, calf scours (bovine enteritis), causes diarrhea and dehydration in newborn calves and often leads to serious sickness and even death. The First Defense®  product line is the only USDA-licensed, orally delivered scours preventive product on the market for calves with claims against E. coli K99, coronavirus and rotavirus (three leading causes of scours). A single dose of our product provides a guaranteed level of protection proven to reduce mortality and morbidity. Our milk antibody products provide Immediate Immunity™ during the first few critical days of life when calves need this protection most. Studies have shown that calves that scour are more susceptible to other diseases later in life and under-perform calves that do not contract scours. The direct, two-part mode-of-action of the First Defense® product line delivers specific immunoglobulins at the gut level to immediately protect against disease, while also providing additional antibodies that are absorbed into the bloodstream. These circulating antibodies function like a natural timed-release mechanism, as they are re-secreted into the gut later to provide extended protection. The First Defense® product line is convenient to use. A calf needs to receive only one dose of First Defense® within the first twelve hours after birth. The capsule format of this product is stored at room temperature and no mixing is required before it is given to the calf. The gel tube formats of this product require refrigeration in accordance with product label indications. We are a leader in the scours prevention market with this product. The third quarter of 2018 marked the 27th anniversary of the original USDA approval of this product in 1991. During the fourth quarter of 2018, our cumulative sales of First Defense® since inception exceeded 22,000,000 doses. We believe that these milestones demonstrate the value of our technology and the long-term market acceptance of our product.
 
We believe that the long-term growth in sales of the First Defense® product line may reflect, at least in part, the success of our strategic decision initiated in 2010 to invest in additional sales and marketing efforts to help us introduce the expanding First Defense® product line to new customers. We launched a communications campaign at the end of 2010 that continues to emphasize how the unique ability of the First Defense® product line to provide Immediate Immunity™ generates a dependable and competitive return on investment for dairy and beef producers. Preventing newborn calves from becoming sick helps them to reach their genetic potential and reduces the need to use treatment antibiotics later in life.
 
Our new product line extension, Tri-Shield First Defense®, is the first calf-level, passive antibody product on the market with USDA-approved disease claims providing Immediate Immunity™ against each of the three leading causes of calf scours (E. coli, coronavirus and rotavirus). This new product achieved USDA approval during the fourth quarter of 2017 and was listed with the Organic Materials Research Institute (OMRI) during the first quarter of 2019, which means it can be used on organic farms. Tri-Shield® combines the E. coli and coronavirus antibodies contained in our bivalent product with a guaranteed level of rotavirus antibody in one preventative dose in a gel tube delivery format. This unique breadth of claims further differentiates our product from competitive products on the market that contain only one or two of these label claims. Because it is possible that all farms may not have a rotavirus problem, we are continuing to sell the bivalent formats of the First Defense® product line as options for customers.
 
Historically, the primary tool to help combat scours has been to vaccinate the cow with a dam-level scours vaccine. With this expanded claim set, we believe we can compete more effectively against these dam-level vaccine products that are given to the mother cow to increase the antibody level against specific scours-causing pathogens in the colostrum that she produces for her newborn. It is generally believed that only 80% of animals respond to a vaccine, which could leave about 20% of calves unprotected. We believe that the variability in a cow’s immune response to vaccines creates a sales opportunity for our product. Additionally, our research suggests that treatment protocols for dam-level scours vaccine programs are not always followed, leaving even more calves compromised. Our new marketing campaign, Beyond Vaccination®, emphasizes that by delivering Immediate Immunity™ directly to the calf via Tri-Shield®, producers can reduce stress-causing injections to the cow and save the associated labor for vaccines that are more critical to cow health. Reliance on a dam-level scours vaccine requires that money be spent before it is known whether the cow is carrying a viable, valued calf. With Tri-Shield®, every calf is equally protected and that investment can be targeted to the calves that are most critical to the operation. This, in turn, can free up space in the cow’s vaccination schedule to improve her immune response to vaccines that are critical to her health.
 
First Defense Technology® is a unique whey protein concentrate that is processed utilizing our proprietary colostrum (first milk) protein purification methods, for the nutritional and feed supplement markets without the claims of our USDA-licensed product. During 2012, we initiated a limited launch of a gel tube delivery format of our First Defense Technology® in a gel solution. We achieved USDA claims for this product format during the fourth quarter of 2018 and Canadian approval during the first quarter of 2019, and it is now being sold as Dual-Force™ First Defense®. We are selling the same concentrated whey proteins in a bulk powder format (no capsule), which is delivered with a scoop and mixed with colostrum for feeding to calves. We are working to achieve USDA claims for this product format during 2019. During 2011, Milk Products, LLC of Chilton, Wisconsin launched commercial sales of their product, Ultra Start® 150 Plus and certain similar private label products, which are colostrum replacers with First Defense Technology® Inside.

Other competition for resources that dairy producers allocate to their calf enterprises has been increased by the many new products (principally feed supplements) that have been introduced to the calf market. Warm and dry weather reduces the producer’s perception of the need for a disease preventative product like the First Defense® product line. However, heat stress on calves caused by extremely hot summer weather can increase the incidence of scours, just as harsher winter weather benefits our sales. Market conditions in the dairy and beef industries, including milk pricing and prices for calves, have weakened since 2014. Milk prices made modest improvements in 2017 over the annual averages for 2016 and 2015 but declined by 10% in 2018 in comparison to 2017. Despite the significant market volatility affecting both milk prices and feed costs, we continue to increase our sales.
 
During the first quarter of 2017, we discontinued the topical wipes product line due to its limited sales growth potential and minimal contribution to profits.
 
During 2001, we began to offer our own, internally developed California Mastitis Test (CMT). CMT is most often used as a quick on-farm diagnostic to determine which quarter of the udder is mastitic. This test can be performed at cow-side for early detection of mastitis. CMT products are also made by other manufacturers and are readily available to the dairy producer.
 
In connection with our acquisition of certain gel formulation technologies during the first quarter of 2016, we also acquired private label manufacturing rights covering two feed supplement product lines that we now produce and sell under private label relationships with Ridley, USA Inc. of Mankato, MN and Genex Cooperative Inc. of Shawano, WI. These products do not utilize our proprietary antibody technology.
 
Sales and Markets
 
Our sales and marketing team consists of one vice president, seven regional manager positions and one inside sales and marketing position. The First Defense® product line and CMT are sold primarily through major animal health distributors who, in turn, sell to veterinary clinics, fleet stores and direct to farms. We have experienced minimal bad debt with respect to these products. Sales of the First Defense® product line are normally seasonal, with higher sales expected during the first quarter, largely driven by the beef calving season, which runs primarily from January to April, unlike the dairy industry in which operations generally calve year round.
 
We estimate that the total U.S. market for scours preventative products (including sales of our product) that are given to newborn calves (the calf-level market) is approximately $18 million annually. With the additional claim for our new product (Tri-Shield First Defense®) against rotavirus, we are now competing against the dam-level vaccine products that are given to the mother cow to increase the antibody level against specific scours-causing pathogens in the colostrum that she produces for her newborn. We estimate that the dam-level product category covers approximately twice as many calves as the calf-level product segment reaches.
 
The majority of our international sales are to Canada. We price our products in U.S. dollars. To the extent that the value of the dollar declines with respect to any other currency, our competitive position may be enhanced. Conversely, an increase in the value of the dollar in any country in which we sell products may have the effect of increasing the local price of our products, thereby leading to a potential reduction in demand. Generally, our international sales have been generated through relationships with in-country distributors that have knowledge of the local regulatory and marketing requirements. We are initiating our plan to expand the number of countries to which our First Defense® product line is approved for export. Generally, it is our intent to be the holder of these product registrations for each country rather than rely on distribution partners to gain and hold these registrations. This is a long regulatory process but allows us to maximize the use of our product label claims and avoid long-term exclusive distribution agreements. We continue our efforts to grow sales of the First Defense® product line in North America, where there are approximately 41,300,000 dairy and beef cows in the United States and 4,645,000 dairy and beef cows in Canada. We believe that even greater market opportunities exist in other international territories. There are estimated to be approximately 67,400,000 dairy and beef cows in China, 35,450,000 in the European Union, 18,470,000 in Australia and New Zealand, 11,150,000 in Mexico, 1,700,000 in South Korea and 1,470,000 in Japan. The statistics above are provided by an industry compilation of USDA data for 2019. However, industry practices, economic conditions, cause of disease, distribution channels and regulatory requirements may differ in these international markets from what we experience in North America making it more difficult or costly for us to generate and sustain sales volumes at profitable margins in these markets.

We introduced First Defense® into South Korea in 2005 through Medexx Co., Ltd of Gyeonggi-do, Korea and its equivalent into Japan in 2007 through NYS Co., Ltd of Iwate, Japan. The business in Japan is currently not active, but we hope to resume sales in this territory in the coming quarters. We entered into distribution contracts covering certain Middle Eastern countries with Triplest for Drugs and Trade of Madaba, Jordan during the first quarter of 2017 and covering Iran with Senikco, LLC of Laguna Niguel, CA during the fourth quarter of 2016.
 
With Re-Tain™, we are working to expand our product offerings to include an intramammary treatment for subclinical mastitis for the mother cow during lactation. Mastitis (inflammation of the mammary gland) is estimated to cost the U.S. dairy industry approximately $2 billion in economic harm per year, which makes it the most costly and common disease affecting the dairy industry. The disease diminishes the saleable quantity and overall value of milk, in addition to causing other herd health and productivity losses. While the benefit of treating clinical mastitis is widely known, subclinical mastitis (those cases where cows have infected udders, but still produce saleable milk) is associated with its own significant economic losses and is recognized as a substantial contributor to clinical mastitis cases. There is a growing awareness of the cascade of adverse events and conditions associated with subclinical mastitis for both the dairy producer and the milk processor, including reduced or foregone milk quality premiums, lower milk production (some have estimated approximately 1,500 pounds of lost milk, or about $225 at $15.00 per hundredweight, per infected cow), shorter shelf life for fluid milk, lower yields and less flavor for cheese, higher rates of clinical mastitis, lower conception rates, increased abortions and increased cull rates. Some industry experts have estimated that subclinical mastitis costs the U.S. dairy industry approximately $1 billion per year.
 
We believe that Re-Tain™ could revolutionize the way that mastitis is treated by making earlier treatment of subclinically infected cows economically feasible by not requiring a milk discard during, or for a period of time after, treatment, which would be a significant competitive advantage for our product. No other FDA-approved mastitis treatment product on the market can offer this value proposition. Because the milk from cows treated with traditional antibiotics must be discarded, most dairy producers simply do not treat subclinically infected cows. It is generally current practice to treat mastitis only when the disease has progressed to the clinical stage where the milk from an infected cow cannot be sold. The ability to treat such cases without a milk discard could revolutionize the way mastitis is managed in a herd. It is common practice to move sick cows from their regular herd group to a sick cow group for treatment and the related milk discard. This movement causes stress on the cow and a reduction in milk production. Cows treated with our product would not have to be moved, allowing this costly drop in production to be avoided. Our product likely will be priced at a premium to the traditional antibiotic products currently on the market, which are all sold subject to a milk discard requirement. Common milk discard periods cover the duration of treatment and extend from 36 to 96 hours after last treatment, depending on the antibiotic. On average, a cow produces approximately 60 to 80 pounds of milk per day. While milk prices vary significantly, at an average value of $15.00 per 100 pounds, a cow produces approximately $9 to $12 worth of milk per day. These estimated figures would result in milk discard costs ranging from approximately $32 (for 3.5 days of milk at 60 pounds per day) to $132 (for 11 days of milk at 80 pounds per day) per treated animal. We estimate that the approximate cost to the U.S. dairy industry of this discarded milk may be around $300 million per year. We believe that the product’s value proposition demonstrates a return on investment to the dairy producer and the milk processor that will justify a premium over other mastitis treatments on the market today.
 
The USDA’s National Animal Health Monitoring System through its Dairy 2014 study suggests that 21% of all dairy cows are treated with a mastitis drug, of which approximately 51% are treated with third generation cephalosporins. Many fear that the possible overuse of antibiotics in livestock undermines the effectiveness of drugs to combat human illnesses and contributes to a rising number of life-threatening human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria, commonly known as “superbugs”. The FDA is committed to addressing this public health risk. Citing concerns about untreatable, life-threatening infections in humans, new FDA and European regulations are aimed at restricting the use of antibiotics (including cephalosporins) in food animals and at improving milk quality. Regulators have recently increased their monitoring of antibiotic residues in milk and meat. During the first quarter of 2012, the USDA reduced the allowable level of somatic cell counts (SCC) in milk from 750,000 (cells per milliliter) to 400,000 at the individual farm level (not a blended calculation of comingled milk) in order to qualify for an EU health certification for export.

The FDA’s Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) became effective January 1, 2017, restricting the use of medically important antibiotics for performance purposes and requiring more oversight of antibiotic usage in food producing animals by a veterinarian, and more changes and restrictions relating to antibiotic usage appear to be likely. Several major food processors and retailers have implemented policies addressing this growing public health concern. By reducing the risk of antibiotic residues and slowing the development of antibiotic-resistant organisms, we can improve food quality and preserve medically important antibiotics for human disease treatment. This would not be a concern for Re-Tain™ because Nisin is not used for human health. This current environment could be favorable to the introduction of our new product as an alternative to traditional antibiotics such as penicillin and cephalosporins. We believe that this changing environment of new regulations and public opinion supports the value of our ongoing development and commercialization efforts for Re-Tain™. Additionally, we believe that the use of our First Defense® product line is consistent with this trend of reducing the use of antibiotics because the prevention of calf scours early in life with our purified colostrum antibodies can reduce the need for treatment antibiotics later in a calf’s life.
 
It is difficult to estimate the potential size of the market for the treatment of subclinical mastitis because this disease is largely left untreated presently. We believe that approximately 20-30% of the U.S. dairy herd is affected by subclinical mastitis caused by Gram-positive organisms falling within the claim spectrum of our product. This compares to approximately 2% of the U.S. herd that is thought to be infected with clinical mastitis, where approximately $60 million per year is spent on drug treatments. We believe that similar market opportunities also exist outside of the United States and for the treatment of dry (non-lactating) cows. We expect the Drug Substance production facility that we constructed for approximately $20.8 million to have annual production capacity sufficient to meet approximately $10 million in sales of Re-Tain™. Our new facility is designed to have enough room to add a second fermentation and recovery portion of the production line to be purchased and installed at the cost of approximately $7 million to effectively double production output. We would consider making this investment only after commercial acceptance of the product is demonstrated. If annual sales exceed approximately $20 million with finished product filling services provided by a contractor, we would evaluate all Nisin supply options, factoring in efficiencies and yield improvements. Building an additional Drug Substance production facility to meet our needs at that time may be the most cost-effective solution. See additional disclosures about our manufacturing strategies and capacity under “Product Development” below.
 
With a measured approach to expanding our customer-facing staff, it is our objective to increase our current annual level of product sales of approximately $11 million to approximately $20 million through both continued growth in sales of the First Defense® product line and a successful launch of Re-Tain™ as soon as possible. As market penetration for both new products is achieved and additional resources are dedicated to production, sales, marketing and technical services, our longer-term goal is to exceed the $30 million level of annual product sales as soon as possible during the five-year period after the market launch of Re-Tain™.
 
Product Development
 
The majority of our product development spending has been focused on the development of Re-Tain™, our purified Nisin treatment for subclinical mastitis in lactating cows. During the nineteen-year period that began on January 1, 2000 and ended on December 31, 2018, we invested the aggregate of approximately $15,543,000 (excluding depreciation and the capital cost of our Drug Substance production facility) in the development of this product. This estimated allocation reflects only direct expenditures and includes no allocation of product development or administrative overhead expenses. Approximately $2.9 million of this investment was offset by related product licensing revenues and grant income, most of which was earned from 2001 to 2007.
 
Nisin is a bacteriocin that is not used in human medicines and could alleviate some of the social concerns that the widespread use of antibiotics encourages the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (“superbugs”). This antibacterial peptide is known to be effective against most Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria. Mastitis, which costs the dairy industry about $2 billion per year, is currently treated with traditional antibiotic products, and treatment is generally reserved for clinical infections when the cow produces non-saleable milk. The “zero milk discard” product feature approved for Re-Tain™ would make earlier treatment of sick cows economically feasible, while these cows are still producing saleable milk. No other existing product can provide this kind of value proposition.
 
During 2000, we acquired an exclusive license from Nutrition 21, Inc. (formerly Applied Microbiology Inc. or AMBI) to develop and market Nisin-based products for animal health applications, which allowed us to initiate the development of Re-Tain™. In 2004, we paid Nutrition 21 approximately $965,000 to buy out this royalty and milestone-based license to Nisin, thereby acquiring control of the animal health applications of Nisin. Nisin is a well characterized substance, having been used in food preservation applications for over 50 years. Food-grade Nisin, however, cannot be used in pharmaceutical applications because of its low purity. Our Nisin technology includes processing and purification methods to achieve pharmaceutical-grade purity.

In 2004, we entered into a product development and marketing agreement with Pfizer Animal Health (now known as Zoetis) covering this product. That company elected to terminate the agreement in 2007. We believe that this decision was not based on any unanticipated efficacy or regulatory issues. Rather, we believe the decision was primarily driven by a marketing concern relating to their fear that the milk from treated cows could interfere with the manufacture of certain cultured dairy products. Due to the zero milk discard feature, there is a risk that Nisin from the milk of treated cows could interfere with the manufacture of certain (but not all) commercial cultured dairy products, such as some kinds of cheese and yogurt, if a process tank contains a high enough percentage of milk from treated cows. The impact of this potential interference ranges from a delay in the manufacturing process (which does happen at times for other reasons) to the less likely stopping of a cheese starter culture. Milk from cows that have been treated with our product that is sold exclusively for fluid milk products presents no such risk. We worked with scientists and mastitis experts to conduct a formal risk assessment to quantify the impact that milk from treated cows may have on cultured dairy products. This study concluded that the dilution of milk from treated cows through comingling with milk from untreated cows during normal milk hauling and storage practices reduces the risk of interference with commercial dairy cultures to a negligible level when the product is used in accordance with the product label. We do not believe that such a premium-priced product will be used as part of a whole herd (“blitz”) treatment protocol, which reduces the risk of cheese interference. We do not see this as a significant problem as modern “precision dairying” practices, as well as cost and other economic considerations, support reducing the indiscriminate use of drug treatments.
 
The NADA for Re-Tain™ is comprised of five principal Technical Sections and one administrative submission that are subject to phased review by the FDA. By statute, each Technical Section submission is generally subject to a six-month review cycle by the FDA. Each Technical Section can be reviewed and approved separately. Upon review and assessment by the FDA that all requirements for a Technical Section have been met, the FDA may issue a Technical Section Complete Letter. The current status of our work on these submissions to the FDA is as follows:
 
1) Environmental Impact: During the third quarter of 2008, we received the Environmental Impact Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA.
 
2) Target Animal Safety: During the second quarter of 2012, we received the Target Animal Safety Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA.
 
3) Effectiveness: During the third quarter of 2012, we received the Effectiveness Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA. The draft product label carries claims for the treatment of subclinical mastitis associated with Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, and coagulase-negative staphylococci in lactating dairy cattle. In our pivotal effectiveness study, statistically significant cure rates were associated with a statistically significant reduction in milk somatic cell count, which is an important measure of milk quality.
 
4) Human Food Safety (HFS): During the third quarter of 2018, we received the Human Food Safety Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA confirming, among other things, a zero milk discard period and a zero meat withhold period during and after treatment with our product.
 
5) Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC): Obtaining FDA approval of the CMC Technical Section is the final critical step to FDA approval and to initial commercial sales. Implementing Nisin production at commercial scale, which is a required component of the CMC Technical Section, has been the most expensive part of this project. We previously entered into an agreement with a multi-national pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturer for our commercial-scale supplies of Nisin. However, we determined in 2014 that the agreement did not offer us the most advantageous supply arrangement in terms of either cost or long-term dependability. We presented this product development opportunity to a variety of large and small animal health companies. While such a corporate partnership could have provided access to a much larger sales and marketing team and allowed us to avoid the large investment in a commercial-scale production facility, the partner would have taken a large share of the gross margin from all future product sales of Re-Tain™. The regulatory and marketing feedback about the prospects for this product that we received from prospective partners, following their due diligence, was positive. During the third quarter of 2014, we completed an investment in facility modifications and processing equipment necessary to produce the Nisin Drug Substance (the active pharmaceutical ingredient) at small-scale. This small-scale facility was used to i) expand our process knowledge and controls, ii) establish operating ranges for critical process parameters, iii) conduct product stability studies, iv) optimize process yields and v) verify the cost of production. We believe these efforts have reduced the risks associated with our investment in the commercial-scale production facility. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we acquired land nearby to our existing Portland facility for the construction of a new commercial-scale Drug Substance manufacturing facility. We commenced construction of this facility during the third quarter of 2016 and completed construction during the fourth quarter of 2017. Equipment installation and qualification was initiated during the third quarter of 2017 and completed during the third quarter of 2018. The total cost of this building and equipment investment was approximately $20.8 million.

 We made our first phased Drug Substance submission to the FDA of this comprehensive and complex Technical Section during the first quarter of 2019. This Technical Section includes data from the Nisin Drug Substance Registration Batches produced at commercial scale in our new manufacturing facility. This submission is subject to a six-month review period. The timing of this first submission does not directly impact the regulatory timeline because the second phased Nisin Drug Product submission (which will include responses to the FDA review of the first phased submission and detailed information about the manufacturing process and controls for the sterile Nisin Drug Product) defines the critical path to product approval. A successful FDA inspection of our manufacturing facility must also be achieved. The second phased Drug Product submission, which is also subject to a six-month review period, will not be made in time to achieve product approval by our original goal of December 2019.
 
 Since 2010, we have been a party to a long-term exclusive product development and contract manufacturing agreement with Norbrook Laboratories Limited of Newry, Northern Ireland, an FDA-approved Drug Product manufacturer, covering the final formulation, aseptic filling and final packaging services for Re-Tain™. Norbrook has provided services to us under this contract throughout the FDA process for use in all of our pivotal studies. During the fourth quarter of 2015, this agreement was amended and restated to, among other things, extend the term of the agreement to January 1, 2024. It has been our expectation that we would have these services available through both the remainder of the development process and approximately the first four years of commercial sales. However, the agreement includes a provision potentially entitling Norbrook to terminate the agreement if we fail to receive FDA approval for Re-Tain™ by mid-December of 2019. Due to unexpected difficulties and delays encountered by Norbrook at this late stage of the development and the usual FDA timeline for processing CMC Technical Sections, we do not expect to receive FDA approval by the December 2019 date. 
 
 In anticipation of this potential issue, we have made requests to Norbrook to amend the existing agreement to avoid early termination, including a shorter term and increased payments to Norbrook. However, we have not yet reached resolution on an amendment, and it remains unclear whether we will be able to reach agreement on a suitable amendment, or if we do, for how long we will continue to have access to Norbrook’s services. Consequently, we have been actively investigating multiple alternatives, including securing an agreement for such services with another qualified third party or performing the services in-house by constructing an aseptic filling capability within our new Drug Substance production facility. Because both of these alternatives would likely delay our commencement of commercial sales of Re-Tain™ to at least 2021, we believe, in the case of a new third-party manufacturer, and to at least 2022, we estimate, in the case of performing these services in-house, our strong preference would be to reach at least an interim arrangement with Norbrook, while we pursue the implementation of the chosen alternative in parallel.
 
 The option of establishing our own final formulation, aseptic filling and final packaging capability for Drug Product would provide us with the longer-term advantage of controlling the entire manufacturing process for Re-Tain™ in one facility, thereby reducing our dependence on third parties and potentially reducing our manufacturing costs, but it would require us to raise additional capital to fund the cost of the equipment, facility modifications and related validation process, which we estimate on a very preliminary basis to be approximately $4 million. This equipment would occupy space in our new Drug Substance facility that we had originally intended to use to double our Drug Substance manufacturing capacity if warranted by Re-Tain™ sales volumes during the initial years following product launch, as discussed above under “Sales and Markets”, thus limiting the maximum production capacity of our new Drug Substance facility. This could possibly leave us unable to meet growing customer demand for Re-Tain™ until and unless we are able to expand that capacity elsewhere or otherwise relocate certain manufacturing activities to enable the expansion to occur.
 
After approval of the CMC Technical Section, there is a 60-day administrative review before anticipated product license approval can be issued and commercial sales can be initiated.

We are party to a long-term, exclusive supply agreement with Plas-Pak Industries, Inc. (now owned by Nordson Corporation) of Norwich, Connecticut covering the proprietary syringe that was developed specifically for treating cows with our mastitis product. These syringes were used for all pivotal studies. During the third quarter of 2017, this agreement was extended to January 1, 2024. 
 
Our second most important product development initiatives (in terms of dollars invested and, we believe, potential market impact) have been focused on other improvements, extensions or additions to our First Defense® product line. During the second quarter of 2009 we entered into an exclusive license with the Baylor College of Medicine covering the underlying rotavirus vaccine technology used to generate the specific antibodies for use with animals. This perpetual license (if not terminated for cause) is subject to ongoing royalty payments. We achieved product license approval and initiated market launch of this product, Tri-Shield First Defense®, during the fourth quarter of 2017. During the third quarter of 2018, we obtained approval from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to sell Tri-Shield® in Canada. We expect to initiate sales in Canada after domestic demand is met. We achieved USDA approval of our bivalent gel tube formulation (formerly marketed as First Defense Technology®) during the fourth quarter of 2018 and have re-branded this product format, together with the bolus format, as Dual-Force™ First Defense®. We are currently working to establish USDA claims for our bivalent bulk powder formulation of First Defense Technology®. We are also investing in additional studies comparing the First Defense® product line to the competition.
 
At the same time, we are working to expand our product development pipeline of bacteriocins that can be used as alternatives to traditional antibiotics. During the second quarter of 2015, we entered into an exclusive option agreement to license new bacteriocin technology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. During the first quarter of 2019, we extended this exclusive option agreement through March 2021. This technology focuses on bacteriocins having activity against Gram-negative infections for use in combating mastitis in dairy cattle. Subject to the availability of resources, we intend to begin new development projects that are aligned with our core competencies and market focus. We also remain interested in acquiring, on suitable terms, other new products and technologies that fit with our sales focus on the dairy and beef industries.
 
Competition
 
Our competition in the animal health market includes other biotechnology companies and major animal health companies. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and human resources and more extensive product development capabilities than we do.
 
We would consider any company that sells an antibiotic to treat mastitis, such as Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck Animal Health and Zoetis (formerly Pfizer Animal Health, a division of Pfizer, Inc.), to be among the potential competitors with respect to Re-Tain™. We expect the FDA to grant a period of five years of market exclusivity for our product (meaning the FDA would not grant approval to a second NADA with the same active drug for a period of five years after the first NADA approval is granted) under Section 512(c)(2)F of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
 
There are several other products on the market (some with claims and some without) that are delivered to newborn calves to prevent scours. We believe that the First Defense® product line offers two significant competitive advantages. First, only the First Defense® product line provides protection against E. coli, coronavirus and rotavirus, three of the leading causes of calf scours. Second, being derived from colostrum, our product offers Immediate ImmunityTM through antibodies that both function at the gut level and are absorbed into the blood stream for future protection. All formats of our product can be administered without delaying or adversely affecting maternal colostrum.
 
Zoetis sells a product that competes directly with the First Defense® product line in preventing scours via oral delivery to newborn calves. Their product (Calf-Guard®) is a modified-live virus vaccine. Newborn calves respond poorly to vaccines and the immune system must be given time to develop a response to vaccines. Both our product and Calf-Guard® carry claims against coronavirus and rotavirus infections, but this competitive product does not carry a claim against E. coli infections like our product does. It is common practice to delay colostrum feeding when dosing a calf with Calf-Guard® so that the antibodies in the colostrum do not inactivate the vaccine product. There is no nutritional benefit to withholding milk from newborn calves. In contrast, we encourage the feeding of four quarts of high quality colostrum immediately after birth when dosing a calf with our product, which is standard practice for good calf health. Because the antibodies in our product would likely work to inactivate a modified-live vaccine, rendering it useless or less useful, our product label historically included a precaution that First Defense® should not be used within five days of such a vaccine. During the first quarter of 2015, the USDA granted us permission to remove this precaution from our label, and we have done so. We believe that this precaution should be required on the Calf-Guard® label to prevent inactivation of that product by First Defense® antibodies or colostrum. Our product is priced at a premium to Calf-Guard®.

Elanco Animal Health (a division of Eli Lilly and Company) and Boehringer Ingelheim also sell directly competitive products. The Elanco product (Bovine Ecolizer® and Bovine Ecolizer® + C20) was acquired through Elanco’s January 2015 acquisition of Novartis Animal Health and carries claims to prevent scours in newborn calves caused by E. coli and C. perfringens. The Boehringer product (Bar-Guard-99™) carries claims to prevent scours in newborn calves caused by E. coli. These two products are both derived from horse blood rather than the bovine colostrum used for the First Defense® product line. Equine antibodies are less efficiently absorbed into the bovine bloodstream, so fewer antibodies are re-secreted for additional protection.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2016, Merck launched a new competitive product into this market space. This product (BOVILIS® Coronavirus) is a modified-live virus intranasal vaccine that carries a claim against coronavirus only.
 
When compared to the other USDA-approved calf-level scours preventatives, we believe we are first in sales dollars and second in volume. This product category is comprised of five (increasing from four until the fourth quarter of 2016) primary brands that are given either orally or intranasal to newborn dairy and beef calves immediately after birth. Market research that we subscribe to suggests that our product comprised approximately 34% and 33% of the total doses sold in this product category (one dose equates to one calf, according to label administration on all products) during 2018 and 2017, respectively. These estimates are down from 36% during 2016 and 40% during 2015 when the product category included only 4 primary brands (one of which experienced lack of supply to the market during late 2014 and into the middle of 2015). This market share estimate is slightly up from 32% in 2014 and up from 26% and 22% in 2013 and 2012, respectively, as the total volume in the product category has steadily increased. These estimates do not include sales of vaccine products that are given to the dam (mother cow), which is discussed below.
 
With the new rotavirus claim for our product (Tri-Shield First Defense®) we are now competing against dam-level vaccine products that are given to the mother cow to increase the antibody level against scours-causing pathogens in the colostrum that she produces for her newborn. Those products are sold by Elanco (Scour Bos™), Merck (Guardian®) and Zoetis (ScourGuard®). Despite the best-managed dam vaccine program, colostrum quality is naturally variable and newborn calves do not always get the antibodies they need from maternal colostrum. We believe that the guaranteed dose of antibodies in our product provides more consistent protection than such vaccine products.
 
We may not be aware of competition that we face, or may face in the future, from other companies. Our competitive position will be highly influenced by our ability to attract and retain key scientific, managerial and sales personnel, to develop proprietary technologies and products, to obtain USDA, FDA or foreign approvals for new products, to effectively promote and market our products, to have available properly licensed, efficient and effective raw material and finished product manufacturing resources and to continue to profitably sell our current products. We currently compete on the basis of product performance, price and distribution capability. We continue to monitor our network of independent distributors to maintain our competitive position.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We own a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to our research, products and processes. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, know-how and other intellectual property rights in the United States and other countries. While the Company believes the ownership of its intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success depends in part on such ownership, the Company also relies heavily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.
 
We own: (a) U.S. Patent No. 6,794,181 entitled “Method of Purifying Lantibiotics”, which covers a manufacturing process for preparing pharmaceutical-grade Nisin, which was issued in 2004; and (b) U.S. Patent No. 10,023,617 entitled “Methods and Systems of Producing Pharmaceutical Grade Lantibiotics”, which covers key, novel and proprietary aspects of our manufacturing process for preparing pharmaceutical-grade Nisin, and was issued during the third quarter of 2018. In the future, we may file additional patent applications for certain products under development. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued with respect to any pending or future applications. In some cases, we have chosen (and may choose in the future) not to seek patent protection for certain products or processes. In those instances, we have sought (and may seek in the future) to maintain the confidentiality of any relevant intellectual property and other proprietary rights through operational measures and contractual agreements.

We own numerous trademarks and trade dress that are very important to our business, and have several trademark and trade dress applications and registrations in the United States, Canada, Iran and Turkey. We own the following U.S. trademark registrations: IMMUCELL, FIRST DEFENSE, FD FIRST DEFENSE (& Design), FIRST DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY, TRI-SHIELD FIRST DEFENSE, TRI-SHIELD FIRST DEFENSE (& Design), YOUR CALF CREW, BEYOND VACCINATION, BEYOND VACCINATION (& Design), CALF HERO and TRI-SHIELD. We also own U.S. registrations for the color blue for our blue gel and blue bolus FIRST DEFENSE products. We own pending U.S. trademark applications for the DUAL-FORCE and RE-TAIN trademarks. The United States Patent and Trademark Office issued a determination that our IMMEDIATE IMMUNITY trademark, which we use in connection with marketing of all of our products, is generic. Rather than appeal this finding, we are continuing to build our common law rights in the brand. The FDA issued a determination that the name, MAST OUT, which we had intended to use for our purified Nisin product, is overly promotional. Rather than continuing an appeal of this decision, we selected a new product name, RE-TAIN, which was approved by the FDA during the first quarter of 2019. During the first quarter of 2017, we sold our registered trademarks related to dairy wipes, WIPE OUT and THE ONE STEP COW PREP, when we discontinued that product line.
 
Government Regulation
 
We believe that we are in compliance with current regulatory requirements relating to our business and products. The manufacture and sale of animal health biologicals within the United States is generally regulated by the USDA. We have received USDA and Canadian Food Inspection Agency approval for the bolus format of First Defense® and for the gel tube formats of Tri-Shield First Defense® and Dual-Force™ First Defense®. Re-Tain™ is regulated by the FDA, which regulates veterinary drugs. Regulations in the European Union will likely require that our product be sold subject to a milk discard requirement in that territory, although the duration of the milk discard requirement may be shorter than the discard requirement applicable to competitive antibiotic products in that market. Comparable agencies exist in foreign countries, and foreign sales of our products will be subject to regulation by such agencies. Many countries have laws regulating the production, sale, distribution or use of biological products, and we may have to obtain approvals from regulatory authorities in countries in which we propose to sell our products. Depending upon the product and its applications, obtaining regulatory approvals may be a relatively brief and inexpensive procedure or it may involve extensive clinical tests, incurring significant expenses and an approval process of several years’ duration. We generally rely on in-country experts to assist us with or to perform international regulatory applications.
Employees
 
We currently employ 51 employees (including 4 part-time employees). Approximately 29 full-time equivalent employees are engaged in manufacturing operations, 9.7 full-time equivalent employees in sales and marketing, 6 full-time equivalent employees in product development activities and 4.3 full-time equivalent employees in finance and administration. As needed, we augment our staff with contracted temporary employees. At times, manufacturing personnel are also utilized, as needed, in the production of clinical material for use in product development. All of our employees are required to execute non-disclosure, non-compete and invention assignment agreements intended to protect our rights in our proprietary products. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and consider our employee relations to be excellent.
Public Information
 
As a reporting company, we file quarterly and annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. We also file current reports on Form 8-K, whenever events warrant or require such a filing. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information about us that we file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.
