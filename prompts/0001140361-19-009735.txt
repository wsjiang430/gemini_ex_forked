History
 
Modine was incorporated under the laws of the State of Wisconsin on June 23, 1916 by its founder, Arthur B. Modine.  Mr. Modine’s “Turbotube” radiators became standard equipment on the famous Ford Motor Company Model T.  When he died at the age of 95, A.B. Modine had personally been granted more than 120 U.S. patents for his heat transfer innovations.  The standard of innovation exemplified by A.B. Modine remains the cornerstone of Modine today.
Terms and Year References
 
When we use the terms “Modine,” “we,” “us,” the “Company,” or “our” in this report, unless the context otherwise requires, we are referring to Modine Manufacturing Company.  Our fiscal year ends on March 31 and, accordingly, all references to a particular year mean the fiscal year ended March 31 of that year, unless indicated otherwise.
Business Strategy and Results
 
Modine pursues market leadership by being a customer-focused, global company delivering exceptional quality, innovation and value.  We will grow our core business of thermal management with superior technical solutions in systems, products and services – coupled with a cost competitive structure.
 
During fiscal 2019, we continued to employ our Strengthen, Diversify and Grow (“SDG”) strategy in order to transform Modine into a more diversified industrial thermal-management company.  We launched our SDG strategy over three years ago to establish a more global, product-based organizational structure and a strategic framework for our company.  Both our Commercial and Industrial Solutions (“CIS”) and Building HVAC Systems (“BHVAC”) segments experienced significant sales and earnings growth this year, which we directly attribute to our SDG initiatives to further diversify and grow these higher margin business segments.  In addition, in January 2019, we announced our strategic review of alternatives for our automotive business within our Vehicular Thermal Solutions (“VTS”) segment.  Since this announcement, we have made significant progress in our evaluation and, while we are continuing to explore various alternatives, we currently believe that a sale of the automotive business is the most likely path forward to optimize the VTS segment’s profitability and reprioritize capital investments across all of our businesses.  We believe our SDG strategy will continue to keep us grounded, thriving, and transforming to optimize the value we offer our customers and to provide the highest returns for our shareholders.

Our top five customers are in four different markets – automotive, commercial vehicle, off-highway, and data center cooling – and our ten largest customers accounted for 50 percent of our fiscal 2019 sales.  In fiscal 2019, 58 percent of our total sales were generated from customers outside of the U.S., with 52 percent of total sales generated by foreign operations and 6 percent generated by exports from the U.S.  In fiscal 2018, 61 percent of our total sales were generated from customers outside of the U.S., with 56 percent of total sales generated by foreign operations and 5 percent generated by exports from the U.S.  In fiscal 2017, 62 percent of our total sales were generated from customers outside of the U.S., with 55 percent of total sales generated by foreign operations and 7 percent generated by exports from the U.S.
 
During fiscal 2019, our consolidated net sales were $2.21 billion, a 5 percent increase from $2.10 billion in fiscal 2018.  This increase was primarily due to higher sales in each of our operating segments.  Our operating income of $110 million in fiscal 2019 increased $18 million compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher earnings in the CIS and BHVAC segments, partially offset by lower earnings in the VTS segment.
 
In continued support of our SDG initiatives and in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations, we have engaged in various restructuring activities.  As a result, we recorded $10 million of restructuring expenses during fiscal 2019, primarily related to severance expenses resulting from targeted headcount reductions in Europe and the Americas within the VTS segment.

Other | | 3 | % | | 3 | %

Competitive Position
 
We compete with many manufacturers of heat transfer and HVAC&R products, some of which are divisions of larger companies.  The markets for our products continue to be very dynamic.  Our traditional OEM customers are faced with dramatically increased international competition and have expanded their global manufacturing footprints to compete in local markets.  In addition, consolidation within the supply base and vertical integration has introduced new or restructured competitors to our markets.  Some of these market changes have caused us to experience competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs, lower healthcare costs, and lower tax rates.  As a result, we have expanded and continue to expand our geographic footprint, in part to provide more flexibility to serve our customers around the globe.  Many of our customers also continue to ask us, as well as their other primary suppliers, to provide research and development (“R&D”), design, and validation support for new potential projects.  This combined work effort often results in stronger customer relationships and more partnership opportunities for us.
Business Segments
 
Each of our operating segments is managed by a vice president and has separate financial results reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.  These results are used by management in evaluating the performance of each business segment and in making decisions on the allocation of resources amongst our various businesses.  Effective April 1, 2018, we formed the VTS segment by combining our Americas, Europe, and Asia operations to enable us to operate as a more global, product-based organization.  We also merged our Americas coils business into the CIS segment to accelerate operational improvements and organizational efficiencies.

Our Vehicular Business
 
VTS Segment
 
The continued globalization of our vehicular customer base requires us to manage our strategic approach, product offerings and the competitive environment on a global basis.  This trend offers significant opportunities for us with our market positioning, including our presence in key vehicular markets (U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Europe, India, China, South Korea, and Japan) and a global organization with the expertise to solve technical challenges.  We are recognized for having strong technical support in all regions, an extensive product portfolio, and the ability to provide global standard designs for our customers. Many vehicular OEMs continue to expect cost reductions from suppliers while requiring a consistent level of quality.  In addition, these OEMs seek new technology solutions at low prices for their thermal management needs.  In general, this creates challenges for us and the entire supply base, but also provides an opportunity for suppliers, like Modine, who develop innovative solutions at a competitive cost.
    Each of our main vehicular competitors, AKG Group, BorgWarner, Dana Corporation, Denso Corporation, Mahle, Tata Toyo, TitanX, T. Rad Co. Ltd., UFI Filters, Valeo SA, Hanon Systems, and Zhejiang Yinlun Machinery Co. Ltd., have a multi-regional or worldwide presence.  Increasingly, we face heightened competition as these competitors expand their product offerings and manufacturing footprints through expansion into lower-cost countries or lower-cost sourcing initiatives.  In addition, competitors from some lower-cost regions are beginning to expand into new geographical markets.
 
The following summarizes the primary markets served by our VTS segment:

Raw Materials 
We purchase aluminum, nickel and steel from several domestic and foreign suppliers.  In general, we do not rely on any one supplier for these materials, which are, for the most part, available from numerous sources in quantities required by us.  The supply of copper and brass material is concentrated between two global suppliers, with other suppliers qualified and supplying lesser amounts to mitigate risk.  We typically do not experience raw material shortages and believe that our suppliers’ production of these metals will be adequate throughout the next fiscal year.  We typically adjust metals pricing with our raw material suppliers on a monthly basis and our major fabricated component suppliers on a quarterly basis.  When possible, we have included provisions within our long-term customer contracts which allow us to adjust customer prices, on a prospective basis, based upon increases and decreases in the cost of key raw materials.  When applicable, however, these contract provisions are typically limited to the underlying cost of the material based upon the London Metal Exchange, and do not include related premiums or fabrication costs.  In addition, there can often be a three-month to one-year lag until the time that we adjust the price with our customer.
Patents
 
We own or license numerous patents related to our products and operations.  These patents and licenses have been obtained over a period of years and expire at various times.  Because we have many product lines, we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses.  We consider each of our patents, trademarks and licenses to be of value and aggressively defend our rights throughout the world against infringement. We have been granted and/or acquired more than 2,500 patents worldwide over the life of our company.
Research and Development
 
We remain committed to our vision of creating value through technology and innovation.  We focus our engineering and R&D efforts on solutions that meet challenging heat transfer needs of OEMs and other customers within the automotive, powersports, commercial vehicle, construction, agricultural, and commercial, industrial, and building HVAC&R markets.  Our products and systems are often aimed at solving difficult and complex heat transfer challenges requiring advanced thermal management.  Typical market demands are for products and systems that are lighter weight, more compact, more efficient and more durable to meet customer standards as customers work to ensure compliance with increasingly stringent global emissions and energy efficiency requirements.  Our heritage includes a depth and breadth of expertise in thermal management that, combined with our global manufacturing presence, standardized processes, and state-of-the-art technical resources, enables us to rapidly bring customized solutions to our customers.
 
R&D expenditures, including certain application engineering costs for specific customer solutions, totaled $70 million, $66 million, and $64 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.  Over the last three years, R&D expenditures have been between 3 and 5 percent of our consolidated net sales.  This level of investment reflects our continued commitment to R&D in an ever-changing marketplace.  To achieve efficiencies and lower development costs, our R&D groups work closely with our customers on special projects and system designs.  Projects include EGR technology, oil coolers, charge air coolers, refrigerant heat exchangers, and battery thermal management systems for the automotive, commercial vehicle, agriculture, construction, and residential and commercial energy storage markets, which enable our customers to meet more stringent emission and energy efficiency standards.  Most of our current R&D activities are focused on internal development in the areas of powertrain cooling, engine cooling, building HVAC, and commercial and industrial thermal management products.  We also collaborate with several industry, university, and government-sponsored research organizations that conduct research and provide data on practical applications in the markets we serve.

 Table of Contents
We drive sustainable and systematic continuous improvement throughout our company by utilizing the principles, processes and behaviors that are core to these systems.
 
To ensure future quality, we established the Modine Quality Strategy, which focuses on people, process, performance, tools and methods and the Global Modine Management System.
 
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
 
We are committed to preventing pollution, eliminating waste and reducing environmental risks and we have established specific environmental improvement targets and objectives for fiscal 2020.  The majority of our facilities maintain Environmental Management System (“EMS”) certification to the international ISO14001 standard through independent third-party audits.
 
During fiscal 2018, we launched a global initiative to reduce both our energy and water usage by 5 percent by fiscal 2020.  Each of our facilities around the world is actively engaged in support of this initiative, and we are currently on pace to meet our energy and water usage goals in fiscal 2020.  Examples of steps being taken to meet these goals include the installation of more efficient LED lighting systems, the replacement of inefficient boilers and air compressors, improved building HVAC management systems, increased industrial water recycling, and the installation of water-saving faucets.
 
Our product portfolio reflects our sense of environmental responsibility.  We continue to develop and refine environmentally-friendly product lines, including oil, fuel, and EGR coolers for gas and diesel applications, light-weight and high-performance powertrain cooling heat exchangers for both combustion and electric vehicle, air cooled refrigerant and liquid heat exchangers used in residential, commercial, and industrial applications, and our advanced cooling system technology.  These products provide increased fuel economies, enable combustion technologies that reduce harmful gas emissions for vehicles, and provide energy efficient solutions for building and stationary applications. In our CIS segment, we are moving towards smaller diameter tubing across many of our product lines, which has not only made our products more energy efficient, but has enabled our customers to use less refrigerants in order to reduce their global warming potential.  Our BHVAC segment offerings include the EffinityTM, a condensing gas-fired unit heater with industry-leading efficiencies; the AtherionTM Commercial Packaged Ventilation System; the Airedale SchoolMate® with a water source heat pump; and the Airedale Chiller product line-up, ecodesign compliant with European standards.  These products are helping commercial, industrial and residential users achieve high energy efficiencies and reduce utility costs.
 
Obligations for remedial activities may arise at our facilities due to past practices, or as a result of a property purchase or sale.  These expenditures most often relate to sites where past operations followed practices that were considered acceptable under then-existing regulations, but now require investigative and/or remedial work to ensure appropriate environmental protection or where we are a successor to the obligations of prior owners and current laws and regulations require investigative and/or remedial work to ensure sufficient environmental compliance.  Environmental liabilities for investigative work and remediation at sites in the U.S. and abroad totaled $19 million at March 31, 2019.
 
We have consistently out-performed the private-industry Recordable Incident Rate (“RIR” as defined by OSHA) average for the manufacturing sector, which was 3.5 in 2017.  During fiscal 2019, we recorded an RIR of 1.29, which was lower than our prior year rate of 1.42.  Since our acquisition of the Luvata HTS business in fiscal 2017, we have been implementing our behavior-based safety program at CIS segment locations.  We believe our safety program, now in place at all CIS segment locations, has contributed to the decrease in the RIR in fiscal 2019.  Our behavior-based safety program proactively seeks to correct at-risk behaviors while positively reinforcing safe behaviors.  Our focus on behavior-based safety and process stream safety are part of our long-term commitment to strengthen our safety culture.
    Employees
 
We employed approximately 12,200 persons worldwide as of March 31, 2019.
 
Seasonal Nature of Business
 
Our overall operating performance is generally not subject to a significant degree of seasonality, as sales to OEM customers are dependent upon market demand for new vehicles.  However, our second fiscal quarter production schedules are typically impacted by customer summer shut downs and our third fiscal quarter is affected by holiday schedules.  Additionally, our CIS and BHVAC segments experience some seasonality, as demand for HVAC&R products can be affected by heating and cooling seasons, weather patterns, construction, and other factors.  We expect sales volume within our CIS segment to be higher during our first two fiscal quarters due to the construction seasons in the northern hemisphere.  Sales volume within the BHVAC segment is generally stronger in our second and third fiscal quarters, corresponding with demand for heating products.
