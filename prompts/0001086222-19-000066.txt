Item 1. Business
Overview
Akamai provides solutions for delivering, optimizing and securing content and business applications over the Internet. At the core of our solutions is our globally-distributed Akamai Intelligent Edge Platform, which is designed to help our customers leverage the power and reach of the Internet while protecting them from malicious threats to their business. We deploy servers and technology at the “edge” of the Internet – establishing touch points on its perimeter in more than 130 countries and 1,700 networks around the world. This approach affords us unique insight and visibility into traffic volumes, attack patterns, vulnerabilities and other activities across this complex cloud of networks and systems. Leveraging these insights and our position at the edge, we offer our customers solutions designed to protect them from threats and attacks, while empowering them to engage, entertain and interact with end-users; extend their internal systems beyond their corporate perimeters to control access and better leverage the cloud; and help them avoid the burden of navigating and managing the web’s complexity. 
We believe that the edge is the next frontier of digital business – the intersection of users, digital technology and transactions, cloud computing and entertainment – and that our security, performance and delivery solutions can enable our customers to take advantage of the opportunities this intersection creates.
Our Strategy
The technology landscape is rapidly evolving, driving businesses to want to enhance their digital capabilities to improve productivity, transform customer experiences, increase brand awareness and drive competitive advantage. 
The network known as the Internet of Things, or IoT, is now connecting billions of devices that transmit large volumes of data from and within offices, hospitals, manufacturing plants, power grids, roads, schools and homes every second. We believe that new technologies like blockchain are emerging that promise to surpass the ability of current methods to process transactions more quickly and deliver data and content more securely. In addition, organizations seeking streamlined operations, digital transformation and improved cost management are increasing their reliance on servers and networks comprising the “cloud” based on the promise of agility and scale – a promise that has not always been realized. 
At the same time, there are challenges and risks that have the potential to disrupt progress in every industry, compromise online experiences, and, in the most extreme cases, destroy value that took decades to build. Security threats are growing more sinister and advanced. Enterprise applications are moving from behind the firewall to the cloud while employees increasingly demand remote access from a variety of devices – which we believe makes securing access harder to achieve with just traditional perimeter defenses. More consumers are "cutting the cord" and consuming entertainment over the Internet rather than through traditional cable, and they are increasingly using mobile devices to view content and shop. Web pages are also vastly more complex than ever before with advertisements, videos, graphics and other third-party content, causing speed and reliability to suffer.
We believe that Akamai is uniquely positioned to help our customers capitalize on the opportunities and mitigate the risks presented by this dynamic environment. The Akamai Intelligent Edge Platform is architected to surround and extend a customer’s existing cloud architecture, so it can accelerate and secure cloud-based activities and workloads on a global scale, while also improving reliability and reducing cost. Our platform comprises more than 200,000 servers deployed around the world, tied together with sophisticated software and algorithms. Our software also resides on millions of end-user devices, as

part of our work on client-assisted delivery for large media files. By placing integrated computing resources, data, content and security protection closer to end-users, at the edge, our technology is designed to extend our customers’ existing cloud solutions to deliver superior user experiences that are bi-directional, instantaneous, rich and secure. The platform is also architected to enable us to constantly monitor Internet conditions to:
•identify, absorb and block security threats;
•efficiently route traffic away from Internet trouble spots;
•detect what devices individuals are using and optimize content delivery to them;
•provide our customers with business, technical and analytical insights into their online operations; and
•understand different types of traffic visiting websites so that customers can respond to them.
We believe that our scale, unique technology, high-quality intellectual property portfolio, strong relationships with hundreds of leading telecommunications carriers and thousands of major brands on the web, and relentless and personalized attention to customer and partner needs create significant value for stockholders and provide a meaningful edge over competitors.

Competition
The market for our solutions is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service innovations. We expect competition for our offerings to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants. We compete primarily on the basis of:

• | the performance and reliability of our solutions;


• | return on investment in terms of cost savings and new revenue opportunities for our customers;


• | reduced infrastructure complexity;


• | sophistication and functionality of our offerings;


• | scalability;


• | security;


• | ease of implementation and use of service;


• | customer support; and

•price.
We compete with companies offering products and services that address Internet performance problems, including companies that provide Internet content delivery and hosting services, security solutions, technologies used by network operators to improve the efficiency of their systems, streaming content delivery services and equipment-based solutions for Internet performance problems, such as load balancers and server switches. Other companies offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertising-based billing or revenue-sharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the Internet. In addition, existing and potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware, software or other technology solutions rather than rely on a third-party provider like us.
We believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry through the global scale of the Akamai Intelligent Edge Platform, which we believe provides the most effective means of meeting the needs of enterprise customers and is unique to us. In our view, we also benefit from the superior quality of our offerings, our customer service and the information we can provide to our customers about their online operations and value.
Proprietary Rights and Licensing
Our success and ability to compete are dependent on developing and maintaining the proprietary aspects of our technology and operating without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology. As of December 31, 2018, we owned, or had exclusive rights to, more than 375 U.S. patents covering our technology as well as patents issued by other countries. Our U.S.-issued patents have terms extendable to various dates between 2019 and 2037. We do not believe that the expiration of any particular patent in the near future would be materially detrimental to our business. In October 1998, we entered into a license agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, under which we were granted a royalty-free, worldwide exclusive right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of MIT under various patent applications and copyrights relating to Internet content delivery technology. We seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 7,519 full-time and part-time employees. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical, managerial and other personnel for whom competition is intense. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit. We believe our relations with our employees are good, and we have been acknowledged in respected publications as an excellent place to work.
