Item 1.                   Business.
 
Permianville Royalty Trust (the Trust), previously known as Enduro Royalty Trust, is a Delaware statutory trust formed in May 2011 pursuant to a trust agreement (the Trust Agreement) among Enduro Resource Partners LLC (Enduro), as trustor, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the Trustee), as trustee, and Wilmington Trust Company (the Delaware Trustee), as Delaware Trustee.
 
The Trust was created to acquire and hold for the benefit of the Trust unitholders a net profits interest representing the right to receive 80% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from certain properties in the states of Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico held by Enduro as of the date of the conveyance of the net profits interest to the Trust (the Net Profits Interest). The properties in which the Trust holds the Net Profits Interest are referred to as the Underlying Properties.
 
In connection with the closing of the initial public offering of units of beneficial interest in the Trust (Trust Units) in November 2011, Enduro Operating LLC, a Texas limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Enduro (Enduro Operating), and Enduro Texas LLC, a Texas limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Enduro (Enduro Texas), merged, with each entity surviving the merger. By virtue of the merger, Enduro Texas retained all rights, title and interest to the Net Profits Interest. Enduro Operating and Enduro Texas entered into a Conveyance of Net Profits Interest, dated effective as of July 1, 2011 (as supplemented and amended to date, the Conveyance), to effect the transfer of the Net Profits Interest from Enduro Operating to Enduro Texas.
 
On November 8, 2011, Enduro Texas merged with and into the Trust (the Trust Merger) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated November 3, 2011 (the Trust Merger Agreement). Under the terms of the Trust Merger Agreement, the Trust continued as the surviving entity, and the limited liability company interest in Enduro Texas held by Enduro prior to the effective time of the Trust Merger converted into the right to receive 33,000,000 Trust Units. Further, by virtue of the Trust Merger, the Trust retained all right, title and interest to the Net Profits Interest (including the right to enforce the Conveyance against Enduro Operating, as grantor). On November 8, 2011, the Trust, Enduro Operating and Enduro Texas entered into a Supplement to Conveyance of Net Profits Interest to acknowledge that The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee, is deemed the grantee under the Conveyance and a party thereto.
 
Immediately following the Trust Merger, Enduro completed an initial public offering of 13,200,000 Trust Units at a price to the public of $22 per unit.
 
In October 2013, Enduro completed a secondary offering of 11,200,000 Trust Units at a price to the public of $13.85 per unit. The Trust did not sell any Trust Units in the offering and did not receive any proceeds from the offering. After the completion of the secondary offering, Enduro owned 8,600,000 Trust Units, or 26% of the issued and outstanding Trust Units.
 
At a special meeting of Trust unitholders held on August 30, 2017, unitholders approved several proposals, including amendments to the Trust Agreement and Conveyance. In September 2017, Enduro, the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee entered into the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, which amended certain provisions of the Trust Agreement to, among other things, allow Enduro to sell interests in the Underlying Properties free and clear of the Net Profits Interest with the approval of Trust unitholders holding at least 50% of the then outstanding units of the Trust at a meeting held in accordance with the requirements of the Trust Agreement. This amendment reduced the required threshold for approval of such sales from 75% to 50% of the outstanding units of the Trust. To effect the same changes as those included in the amended Trust Agreement, Enduro, the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee also entered into the First Amendment to Conveyance of Net Profits Interest. As a result of the Trust unitholders approving amendments to the Trust Agreement and Conveyance and the approval of the divestiture of certain properties in the Permian Basin, Enduro and the Trustee entered into the Partial Release, Reconveyance and Termination Agreement (the Partial Release). Pursuant to the terms of the Partial Release, the Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, reconveyed, terminated and released to Enduro the Net Profits Interest with respect to certain of the Underlying Properties sold pursuant to eight letter agreements or purchase and sale agreements, as applicable, entered into between Enduro and eight separate counterparties.
 
In July 2018, Enduro entered into a purchase and sale agreement with COERT Holdings 1 LLC (COERT or the Sponsor) for the Underlying Properties and all of the outstanding Trust Units owned by Enduro (the Sale Transaction), and on August 31, 2018, the parties closed the Sale Transaction. In connection with the Sale Transaction, COERT assumed all of Enduros obligations under the Trust Agreement and other instruments to which Enduro and the Trustee were parties. COERT is a Delaware limited liability company engaged in the production and development of oil and natural gas from properties located in the Rockies, the Permian Basin of west Texas and southeastern New Mexico, and the Arklatex region of Texas and Louisiana.
 
References to COERT or the Sponsor in this Form 10-K refer to COERT Holdings 1 LLC, the current sponsor of the Trust, and references to Enduro in this Form 10-K refer to Enduro Resource Partners LLC, the original sponsor of the Trust.
 
The Net Profits Interest is passive in nature and neither the Trust nor the Trustee has any management control over or responsibility for costs relating to the operation of the Underlying Properties. The Net Profits Interest entitles the Trust to receive 80% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from the Underlying Properties during the term of the Trust. The Trust Agreement provides that the Trusts business activities are limited to owning the Net Profits Interest and any activity reasonably related to such ownership, including activities required or permitted by the terms of the Conveyance. As a result, the Trust is not permitted to acquire other oil and natural gas properties or net profits interests or otherwise to engage in activities beyond those necessary for the conservation and protection of the Net Profits Interest.
 
The Trust has no employees. Administrative functions are performed by the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Trustee has no authority over or responsibility for, and no involvement with, any aspect of the oil and gas operations or other activities on the Underlying Properties. The duties of the Trustee are specified in the Trust Agreement and by the laws of the state of Delaware, except as modified by the Trust Agreement. The Trustees principal duties consist of:
 
·                                          collecting cash attributable to the Net Profits Interest;
 
·                                          paying expenses, charges and obligations of the Trust from the Trusts assets;
 
·                                          distributing distributable cash to the Trust unitholders;
 
·                                          causing to be prepared and distributed a tax information report for each Trust unitholder and preparing and filing tax returns on behalf of the Trust;
 
·                                          causing to be prepared and filed reports required to be filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and by the rules of any securities exchange or quotation system on which the Trust Units are listed or admitted to trading;
 
·                                          causing to be prepared and filed a reserve report by or for the Trust by independent reserve engineers as of December 31 of each year in accordance with criteria established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC);
 
·                                          establishing, evaluating and maintaining a system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
 
·                                          enforcing the Trusts rights under certain agreements; and
 
·                                          taking any action it deems necessary or advisable to best achieve the purposes of the Trust.
 
In connection with the formation of the Trust, the Trust entered into several agreements with Enduro that imposed obligations upon Enduro, including the Conveyance and a Registration Rights Agreement, which COERT assumed in connection with the Sale Transaction. The Trustee has the power and authority under the Trust Agreement to enforce these agreements on behalf of the Trust. Additionally, the Trustee may from time to time supplement or amend the Conveyance and the Registration Rights Agreement without the approval of Trust unitholders in order to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any defective or inconsistent provisions, to grant any benefit to all of the Trust unitholders, to comply with changes in applicable law or to change the name of the Trust. Such supplement or amendment, however,

may not materially adversely affect the interests of the Trust unitholders.
 
The Trustee may create a cash reserve to pay for future liabilities of the Trust and may authorize the Trust to borrow money to pay administrative or incidental expenses of the Trust that exceed its cash on hand and available reserves. The Trustee may authorize the Trust to borrow from any person, including the Trustee, the Delaware Trustee or an affiliate thereof, although none of the Trustee, the Delaware Trustee nor any affiliate thereof intends to lend funds to the Trust. The Trustee may also cause the Trust to mortgage its assets to secure payment of the indebtedness. The terms of such indebtedness and security interest, if funds were loaned by the Trustee, Delaware Trustee or an affiliate thereof, would be similar to the terms that such entity would grant to a similarly situated commercial customer with whom it did not have a fiduciary relationship. Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, COERT has provided the Trust with a $1.2 million letter of credit to be used by the Trust in the event that its cash on hand (including available cash reserves) is not sufficient to pay ordinary course administrative expenses. If the Trust requires more than the $1.2 million under the letter of credit to pay administrative expenses, COERT has agreed to loan funds to the Trust necessary to pay such expenses. If the Trust borrows funds or draws on the letter of credit, no further distributions will be made to Trust unitholders until such amounts borrowed or drawn are repaid.
 
Each month, the Trustee pays Trust obligations and expenses and distributes to the Trust unitholders the remaining proceeds received from the Net Profits Interest. The cash held by the Trustee as a reserve against future liabilities or for distribution at the next distribution date may be held in a noninterest-bearing account or may be invested in:
 
·                                          interest-bearing obligations of the United States government;
 
·                                          money market funds that invest only in United States government securities;
 
·                                          repurchase agreements secured by interest-bearing obligations of the United States government; or
 
·                                          bank certificates of deposit.
 
 The Trust is not subject to any pre-set termination provisions based on a maximum volume of oil or natural gas to be produced or the passage of time. The Trust will dissolve upon the earliest to occur of the following:
 
·                                          the Trust, upon approval of the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding Trust Units, sells the Net Profits Interest;
 
·                                          the annual cash proceeds received by the Trust attributable to the Net Profits Interest are less than $2 million for each of any two consecutive years;
 
·                                          the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding Trust Units vote in favor of dissolution; or
 
·                                          the Trust is judicially dissolved.
 
Upon dissolution of the Trust, the Trustee would sell all of the Trusts assets, either by private sale or public auction, and, after payment or the making of reasonable provision for payment of all liabilities of the Trust, distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Trust unitholders.
 
Marketing and Post-Production Services
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Conveyance, the Sponsor has the responsibility to market, or cause to be marketed, the oil and natural gas production attributable to the Net Profits Interest in the Underlying Properties. The terms of the Conveyance restrict the Sponsor from charging any fee for marketing production attributable to the Net Profits Interest other than fees for marketing paid to non-affiliates. Accordingly, a marketing fee is not deducted (other than fees paid to non-affiliates) in the calculation of the Net Profits Interests share of net profits. The net profits to the Trust from the sales of oil and natural gas production from the Underlying Properties attributable to the Net Profits Interest is determined based on the same price that the Sponsor receives for sales of oil and natural gas production attributable to the Sponsors interest in the Underlying Properties. However, if the oil or natural gas is processed, the net profits receive the same processing upgrade or downgrade as the Sponsor.
 
The operators of the Underlying Properties sell the oil produced from the Underlying Properties to third-party crude oil purchasers. Oil production from the Underlying Properties is typically transported by truck from the field to the closest gathering facility or refinery. The operators sell the majority of the oil production from the Underlying Properties under contracts using market sensitive pricing. The price received by the operators for the oil production from the Underlying Properties is usually based on a regional price applied to equal daily quantities in the month of delivery that is then reduced for differentials based upon delivery location and oil quality. Natural gas produced by the operators is marketed and sold to third-party purchasers. The natural gas is sold pursuant to contracts with such third parties, and the sales contracts are in their secondary terms and are on a month-to-month basis. The contract prices are based on a published regional index price, after adjustments for Btu content, transportation and related charges.
 
The following purchasers individually accounted for ten percent or more of sales from the Underlying Properties that were included in calculating the Trusts Income from net profits interest for the periods presented. The table provides the percentage represented by the purchasers during the periods presented:
 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
-----------------------+-------------------------+--
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
ConocoPhillips | 30 | % | 32 | % | 32 | %
Occidental Petroleum | 19 | % | 22 | % | 19 | %
Navajo Refining | 12 | % | 12 | % | 13 | %

Competition and Markets
 
                              The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. The Sponsor competes with major oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas companies for oil and natural gas, equipment, personnel and markets for the sale of oil and natural gas. Many of these competitors are financially stronger than the Sponsor, but even financially troubled competitors can affect the market because of their need to sell oil and natural gas at any price to attempt to maintain cash flow. Because the Sponsor and the third party operators of the Underlying Properties are subject to competitive conditions in the oil and natural gas industry, the Trusts Net Profits Interest is indirectly subject to those same competitive conditions.
 
Oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil, natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas.
 
Future prices for oil and natural gas will directly impact Trust distributions, estimates of reserves attributable to the Trusts interests and estimated and actual future net revenues to the Trust. In view of the many uncertainties that affect the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, neither the Trust nor the Sponsor can make reliable predictions of future oil and natural gas supply and demand or future product prices. Nevertheless, lower product prices generally will result in lower distributions, lower estimates of reserves attributable to the Trusts interests and lower estimated and actual future net revenues to the Trust.
 
All of the Trusts assets are located in the United States. The operators of the Underlying Properties sell the oil and natural gas produced from the Underlying Properties to third-party purchasers in the United States. Demand for natural gas generally is higher in the winter months, but otherwise seasonal factors do not affect the Trust.

Description of Trust Units
 
Each Trust Unit is a unit of beneficial interest in the Trust and is entitled to receive cash distributions from the Trust on a pro rata basis. Each Trust unitholder has the same rights regarding his or her Trust Units as every other Trust unitholder has regarding his or her units. The Trust Units are in book-entry form only and are not represented by certificates. The Trust had 33,000,000 Trust Units outstanding as of March 15, 2019.
Distributions and Income Computations
 
Each month, the Trustee determines the amount of funds available for distribution to the Trust unitholders. Available funds are the excess cash, if any, received by the Trust from the Net Profits Interest and other sources (such as interest earned on any amounts reserved by the Trustee) that month, over the Trusts liabilities for that month. Available funds are reduced by any cash the Trustee decides to hold as a reserve against future liabilities. The holders of Trust Units as of the applicable record date (generally the last business day of each calendar month) are entitled to monthly distributions payable on or before the 10th business day after the record date. In the event that the net profits for any computation period is a negative amount, the Trust will receive no payment for that period, and any such negative amount plus accrued interest will be deducted from gross profits in the following computation period for purposes of determining the net profits for that following computation period.
 
Unless otherwise advised by counsel or the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Trustee will treat the income and expenses of the Trust for each month as belonging to the Trust unitholders of record on the monthly record date. Trust unitholders generally will recognize income and expenses for tax purposes in the month the Trust receives or pays those amounts, rather than in the month the Trust distributes the cash to which such income or expenses (as applicable) relate. Minor variances may occur. For example, the Trustee could establish a reserve in one month that would not result in a tax deduction until a later month.
 
Transfer of Trust Units
 
Trust unitholders may transfer their Trust Units in accordance with the Trust Agreement. The Trustee will not require either the transferor or transferee to pay a service charge for any transfer of a Trust Unit. The Trustee may require payment of any tax or other governmental charge imposed for a transfer. The Trustee may treat the owner of any Trust Unit as shown by its records as the owner of the Trust Unit. The Trustee will not be considered to know about any claim or demand on a Trust Unit by any party except the record owner. A person who acquires a Trust Unit after any monthly record date will not be entitled to the distribution relating to that monthly record date. Delaware law and the Trust Agreement govern all matters affecting the title, ownership or transfer of Trust Units.
Periodic Reports
 
The Trustee files all required Trust federal and state income tax and information returns. The Trustee prepares and mails to Trust unitholders annual reports that Trust unitholders need to correctly report their share of the income and deductions of the Trust. The Trustee also causes to be prepared and filed reports that are required to be filed under the Exchange Act and by the rules of any securities exchange or quotation system on which the Trust Units are listed or admitted to trading, and also causes the Trust to comply with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including but not limited to, establishing, evaluating and maintaining a system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 thereof.
 
Each Trust unitholder and his or her representatives may examine, for any proper purpose, during reasonable business hours, the records of the Trust and the Trustee, subject to such restrictions as are set forth in the Trust Agreement.
 
Liability of Trust Unitholders
 
Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, Trust unitholders are entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The courts in jurisdictions outside of Delaware, however, might not give effect to such limitation.
Voting Rights of Trust Unitholders
 
The Trustee or Trust unitholders owning at least 10% of the outstanding Trust Units may call meetings of Trust unitholders. The Trust is responsible for all costs associated with calling a meeting of Trust unitholders, unless such meeting is called by the Trust unitholders in which case the Trust unitholders are responsible for all costs associated with calling such meeting. Meetings must be held in such location as is designated by the Trustee in the notice of such meeting. The Trustee must send notice of the time and place of the meeting and the matters to be acted upon to all of the Trust unitholders at least 20 days and not more than 60 days before the meeting. Trust unitholders representing a majority of Trust Units outstanding must be present or represented to have a quorum. Each Trust unitholder is entitled to one vote for each Trust Unit owned. Abstentions and broker non-votes shall not be deemed to be a vote cast.
 
Unless otherwise required by the Trust Agreement, a matter may be approved or disapproved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Trust Units present in person or by proxy at a meeting where there is a quorum. This is true even if a majority of the total Trust Units did not approve it. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding Trust Units is required to:
 
·                                          dissolve the Trust;
 
·                                          amend the Trust Agreement (except with respect to certain matters that do not adversely affect the rights of Trust unitholders in any material respect); or
 
·                                          approve the sale of all the assets of the Trust (including the sale of the Net Profits Interest).
 
                              At the special meeting of Trust unitholders held on August 30, 2017, unitholders approved amendments to the Trust Agreement. In September 2017, Enduro, the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee entered into the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, which amended certain provisions of the Trust Agreement to, among other things, allow Enduro (and, therefore, following the Sale Transaction, the Sponsor) to sell interests in the Underlying Properties free and clear of the Net Profits Interest with the approval of Trust unitholders holding at least 50% of the then outstanding units of the Trust at a meeting held in accordance with the requirements of the Trust Agreement. This amendment reduced the required threshold for approval of such sales from 75% to 50% of the outstanding units of the Trust.
 
In addition, certain amendments to the Trust Agreement may be made by the Trustee without approval of the Trust unitholders.

Computation of Net Profits
 
The provisions of the Conveyance governing the computation of the net profits are detailed and extensive. The following information summarizes the material provisions of the Conveyance related to the computation of the net profits, but is qualified in its entirety by the text of the Conveyance, which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Net Profits Interest
 
The amounts paid to the Trust for the Net Profits Interest are based on, among other things, the definitions of gross profits and net profits contained in the Conveyance and described below. Under the Conveyance, net profits are computed monthly, and 80% of the aggregate net profits attributable to the sale of oil and natural gas production from the Underlying Properties for each calendar month will be paid to the Trust on or before the end of the following month. The Sponsor will not pay to the Trust any interest on the net profits held by the Sponsor prior to payment to the Trust, provided that such payments are timely made.
 
Gross profits means the aggregate amount received by the Sponsor from and after July 1, 2011 from sales of oil and natural gas produced from the Underlying Properties that are not attributable to a production month that occurs prior to June 1, 2011 (after deducting the appropriate share of all royalties and any overriding royalties, production payments and other similar charges (in each case, in existence as of June 1, 2011) and other than certain excluded proceeds, as described in the Conveyance), including all proceeds and consideration received (i) directly or indirectly, for advance payments, (ii) directly or indirectly, under take-or-pay and similar provisions of production sales contracts (when credited against the price for delivery of production) and (iii) under balancing arrangements. Gross profits do not include consideration for the transfer or sale of any Underlying Property by the Sponsor or any subsequent owner to any new owner, unless the Net Profits Interest is released (as is permitted under certain circumstances). Gross profits also do not include any amount for oil or natural gas lost in production or marketing or used by the owner of the Underlying Properties in drilling, production and plant operations.
 
Net profits means, as more fully set forth in the Conveyance, gross profits less the following costs, expenses and, where applicable, losses, liabilities and damages all as actually incurred by the Sponsor and attributable to the Underlying Properties on or after July 1, 2011 but that are not attributable to a production month that occurs prior to July 1, 2011 (as such items are reduced by any offset amounts, as described in the Conveyance):
 
·                                          with the exception of certain costs and expenses related to 20 wells located in the Haynesville Shale identified in the Conveyance, all costs for (i) drilling, development, production and abandonment operations, (ii) all direct labor and other services necessary for drilling, operating, producing and maintaining the Underlying Properties and workovers of any wells located on the Underlying Properties, (iii) treatment, dehydration, compression, separation and transportation, (iv) all materials purchased for use on, or in connection with, any of the Underlying Properties and (v) any other operations with respect to the exploration, development or operation of hydrocarbons from the Underlying Properties;
 
·                                          all losses, costs, expenses, liabilities and damages with respect to the operation or maintenance of the Underlying Properties for (i) defending, prosecuting, handling, investigating or settling litigation, administrative proceedings, claims, damages, judgments, fines, penalties and other liabilities, (ii) the payment of certain judgments, penalties and other liabilities, (iii) the payment or restitution of any proceeds of hydrocarbons from the Underlying Properties, (iv) complying with applicable local, state and federal statutes, ordinance, rules and regulations, (v) tax or royalty audits and (vi) any other loss, cost, expense, liability or damage with respect to the Underlying Properties not paid or reimbursed under insurance;
 
·                                          all taxes, charges and assessments (excluding federal and state income, transfer, mortgage, inheritance, estate, franchise and like taxes) with respect to the ownership of, or production of hydrocarbons from, the Underlying Properties;
 
·                                          all insurance premiums attributable to the ownership or operation of the Underlying Properties for insurance actually carried with respect to the Underlying Properties, or any equipment located on any of the Underlying Properties, or incident to the operation or maintenance of the Underlying Properties;
 
·                                          all amounts and other consideration for (i) rent and the use of or damage to the surface, (ii) delay rentals, shut-in well payments and similar payments and (iii) fees for renewal, extension, modification, amendment, replacement or supplementation of the leases included in the Underlying Properties;
 
·                                          all amounts charged by the relevant operator as overhead, administrative or indirect charges specified in the applicable operating agreements or other arrangements covering the Underlying Properties or the Sponsors operations with respect thereto;
 
·                                          to the extent that the Sponsor is the operator of certain of the Underlying Properties and there is no operating agreement covering such portion of the Underlying Properties, those overhead, administrative or indirect charges that are allocated by the Sponsor to such portion of the Underlying Properties;
 
·                                          if, as a result of the occurrence of the bankruptcy or insolvency or similar occurrence of any purchaser of hydrocarbons produced from the Underlying Properties, any amounts previously credited to the determination of the net profits are reclaimed from the Sponsor, then the amounts reclaimed;
 
·                                          all costs and expenses for recording the Conveyance and, at the applicable times, terminations and/or releases thereof;
 
·                                          amounts previously included in gross profits but subsequently paid as a refund, interest or penalty; and
 
·                                          at the option of the Sponsor (or any subsequent owner of the Underlying Properties), amounts reserved for approved development expenditure projects, including well drilling, recompletion and workover costs, which amounts will at no time exceed $2.0 million in the aggregate, and will be subject to the limitations described below (provided that such costs shall not be debited from gross profits when actually incurred).
 
As mentioned above, the costs deducted in the net profits determination will be reduced by certain offset amounts. The offset amounts are further described in the Conveyance, and include, among other things, certain net proceeds attributable to the treatment or processing of hydrocarbons produced from the Underlying Properties and certain non-production revenues, including salvage value for equipment related to plugged and abandoned wells. If the offset amounts exceed the costs during a monthly period, the ability to use such excess amounts to offset costs will be deferred and utilized as offsets in the next monthly period to the extent such amounts, plus accrued interest thereon, together with other offsets to costs, for the applicable month, are less than the costs arising in such month.
 
The Trust is not liable to the owners of the Underlying Properties or the operators for any operating capital or other costs or liabilities attributable to the Underlying Properties. The Trustee expects to make distributions to Trust unitholders monthly; however, in the event that the net profits for any computation period is a negative amount, the Trust will receive no payment for that period, and any such negative amount plus accrued interest will be deducted from gross profits in the following computation period for purposes of determining the net profits for that following computation period.
 
The Trust uses the modified cash basis of accounting to report Trust receipts of the Net Profits Interest and payments of expenses incurred. The Net Profits Interest represents the right to receive revenues (oil and natural gas sales), less direct operating expenses (lease operating expenses and production and property taxes) and development expenses of the Underlying Properties, multiplied by 80%. Cash distributions of the Trust will be made based on the amount of cash received by the Trust pursuant to terms of the Conveyance.

Additional Provisions
 
If a controversy arises as to the sales price of any production, then for purposes of determining gross profits:
 
·                                          any proceeds that are withheld for any reason (other than at the request of the Sponsor) are not considered received until such time that the proceeds are actually collected;
 
·                                          amounts received and promptly deposited with a non-affiliated escrow agent will not be considered to have been received until disbursed to the Sponsor by the escrow agent; and
 
·                                          amounts received and not deposited with an escrow agent will be considered to have been received.
 
The Trustee is not obligated to return any cash received from the Net Profits Interest. Any overpayments made to the Trust by the Sponsor due to adjustments to prior calculations of net profits or otherwise will reduce future amounts payable to the Trust until the Sponsor recovers the overpayments plus interest at a prime rate (as described in the Conveyance).
 
The Conveyance generally permits the Sponsor to transfer without the consent or approval of the Trust unitholders all or any part of its interest in the Underlying Properties, subject to the Net Profits Interest. The Trust unitholders are not entitled to any proceeds of a sale or transfer of the Sponsors interest. Except in certain cases where the Net Profits Interest is released, following a sale or transfer, the Underlying Properties will continue to be subject to the Net Profits Interest, and the gross profits attributable to the transferred property will be calculated, paid and distributed by the transferee to the Trust. The Sponsor will have no further obligations, requirements or responsibilities with respect to any such transferred interests.
 
In addition, the Sponsor may, without the consent of the Trust unitholders, require the Trustee to release the Net Profits Interest associated with any lease that accounts for less than or equal to 0.25% of the total production from the Underlying Properties in the prior 12 months, provided that the Net Profits Interest covered by such releases cannot exceed, during any 12-month period, an aggregate fair market value to the Trust of $500,000. These releases will be made only in connection with a sale by the Sponsor to a non-affiliate of the relevant Underlying Properties and are conditioned upon an amount equal to the fair value to the Trust of such Net Profits Interest being treated as an offset amount against costs and expenses. In January 2019, the Sponsor sold two producing wells and associated acreage of the Underlying Properties under this provision for a sale price of approximately $62,000, and the Trustee released such properties from the Net Profits Interest
 
As the designated operator of a property included in the Underlying Properties, the Sponsor may enter into farm-out, operating, participation and other similar agreements to develop the property, but any transfers made in connection with such agreements will be made subject to the Net Profits Interest. The Sponsor may enter into any of these agreements without the consent or approval of the Trustee or any Trust unitholder.
 
The Sponsor has the right to release, surrender or abandon its interest in any Underlying Property that will no longer produce (or be capable of producing) hydrocarbons in paying quantities (determined without regard to the Net Profits Interest). Upon such release, surrender or abandonment, the portion of the Net Profits Interest relating to the affected property will also be released, surrendered or abandoned, as applicable. The Sponsor also has the right to abandon an interest in the Underlying Properties if (a) such abandonment is necessary for health, safety or environmental reasons or (b) the hydrocarbons that would have been produced from the abandoned portion of the Underlying Properties would reasonably be expected to be produced from wells located on the remaining portion of the Underlying Properties.
 
The Sponsor must maintain books and records sufficient to determine the amounts payable for the Net Profits Interest to the Trust. Monthly and annually, the Sponsor must deliver to the Trustee a statement of the computation of the net profits for each computation period. The Trustee has the right to inspect and review the books and records maintained by the Sponsor during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice. The Sponsor has further agreed to provide the Trust and Trustee with all information and services as are reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes of the Trust, including such accounting, bookkeeping and informational services as may be necessary for the preparation of reports the Trust is required to prepare or file in accordance with applicable tax and securities laws, exchange listing rules and other requirements, including reserve reports and tax returns. Following the sale of all or any portion of the Underlying Properties, the purchaser will be bound by the obligations of the Sponsor under the Trust Agreement and the Conveyance with respect to the portion sold.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Matters
 
The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax matters that may be relevant to the Trust unitholders. This summary is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), existing and proposed Treasury regulations thereunder and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to changes that may or may not be retroactively applied. No attempt has been made in the following summary to comment on all U.S. federal income tax matters affecting the Trust or the Trust unitholders.
 
The summary has limited application to non-U.S. persons and persons subject to special tax treatment such as, without limitation: banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions; Trust unitholders subject to the alternative minimum tax; tax-exempt organizations; dealers in securities or commodities; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings; non-U.S. Trust unitholders that are controlled foreign corporations or passive foreign investment companies; persons that are S-corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities; persons that own their interest in the Trust Units through S-corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities; persons that at any time own more than 5% of the aggregate fair market value of the Trust Units; expatriates and certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States; U.S. Trust unitholders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; persons who hold the Trust Units as a position in a hedging transaction, straddle, conversion transaction or other risk reduction transaction; or persons deemed to sell the Trust Units under the constructive sale provisions of the Code. Each Trust unitholder should consult his or her own tax advisor with respect to his or her particular circumstances.
 
Classification and Taxation of the Trust
 
Tax counsel to the Trust advised the Trust at the time of formation that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in its opinion, the Trust would be treated as a grantor trust and not as an unincorporated business entity. No ruling has been or will be requested from the IRS or another taxing authority. The remainder of the discussion below is based on tax counsels opinion, at the time of formation, that the Trust will be classified as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a grantor trust, the Trust is not subject to U.S. federal income tax at the trust level. Rather, each Trust unitholder is considered for U.S. federal income tax purposes to own its proportionate share of the Trusts assets directly as though no Trust were in existence. The income of the Trust is deemed to be received or accrued by the Trust unitholder at the time such income is received or accrued by the Trust, rather than when distributed by the Trust. Each Trust unitholder is subject to tax on its proportionate share of the income and gain attributable to the assets of the Trust and is entitled to claim its proportionate share of the deductions and expenses attributable to the assets of the Trust, subject to applicable limitations, in accordance with the Trust unitholders tax method of accounting and taxable year without regard to the taxable year or accounting method employed by the Trust.
 
The Trust files annual information returns, reporting to the Trust unitholders all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit. The Trust allocates these items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit to Trust unitholders based on record ownership on the monthly record dates. It is possible that the IRS or another taxing authority could disagree with this allocation method and assert that income and deductions of the Trust should be determined and allocated on a daily or prorated basis, which could require adjustments to the tax returns of the unitholders affected by this issue and result in an increase in the administrative expense of the Trust in subsequent periods.
 
Under current law, the highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to ordinary income of individuals is 37%, and the highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to long-term capital gains (generally, gains from the sale or exchange of certain investment assets held for more than one year) and qualified dividends of individuals is generally 20%. Such marginal tax rates may be effectively increased due to the phaseout of personal exemptions and certain limitations and prohibitions on itemized deductions. The highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to corporations is 21%, and such rate applies to both ordinary income and capital gains.
 
Section 1411 of the Code imposes a 3.8% Medicare tax on certain investment income earned by individuals, estates, and trusts (and a reduced 1.4% tax on certain tax-exempt organizations). For these purposes, investment income generally will include a unitholders allocable share of the trusts interest and royalty income plus the gain recognized from a sale of Trust units. In the case of an individual, the tax is imposed on the lesser of (i) the individuals net investment income from all investments, or (ii) the amount by which the individuals modified adjusted gross income exceeds specified threshold levels depending on such individuals U.S. federal income tax filing status. In the case of an estate or trust, the tax is imposed on the lesser of (i) undistributed net investment income, or (ii) the excess adjusted gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest income tax bracket applicable to an estate or trust begins.
 
If a taxpayer disposes of any Section 1254 property (certain oil, gas, geothermal or other mineral property), and the adjusted basis of such property includes adjustments for depletion deductions under Section 611 of the Code, the taxpayer generally must recapture the amount deducted for depletion as ordinary income (to the extent of gain realized on the disposition of the property). This depletion recapture rule applies to any disposition of property that was placed in service by the taxpayer after December 31, 1986. Detailed rules set forth in Sections 1.1254-1 through 1.1254-6 of the U.S. Treasury Regulations govern dispositions of property after March 13, 1995. The IRS likely will take the position that a unitholder must recapture depletion upon the disposition of a unit.
 
Classification of the Net Profits Interest
 
Tax counsel to the Trust advised the Trust at the time of formation that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, based upon the reserve report and representations made by the Trust regarding the expected economic life of the Underlying Properties and the expected duration of the Net Profits Interest, in its opinion the Net Profits Interest attributable to proved developed reserves will and the Net Profits Interest attributable to proved undeveloped reserves should be treated as continuing, nonoperating economic interests in the nature of royalties payable out of production from the mineral interests they burden. No assurance can be given that the IRS or another taxing authority will not assert that the Net Profits Interest should be treated differently. Any such different treatment could affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in Trust Units.
Reporting Requirements for Widely-Held Fixed Investment Trusts
 
                              The Trustee assumes that some Trust Units are held by middlemen, as such term is broadly defined in the Treasury regulations (and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners and brokers holding an interest for a custodian street name, collectively referred to herein as middlemen). Therefore, the Trustee considers the Trust to be a non-mortgage widely held fixed investment trust (WHFIT) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., 601 Travis Street, Houston, Texas 77002, telephone number 1-512-236-6545, is the representative of the Trust that will provide the tax information in accordance with applicable Treasury regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a WHFIT. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the middlemen holding Trust Units on behalf of unitholders, and not the Trustee of the Trust, are solely responsible for complying with the information reporting requirements under the Treasury regulations with respect to such Trust Units, including the issuance of IRS Forms 1099 and certain written tax statements. Unitholders whose Trust Units are held by middlemen should consult with such middlemen regarding the information that will be reported to them by the middlemen with respect to the Trust Units. Any generic tax information provided by the Trustee of the Trust is intended to be used only to assist Trust unitholders in the preparation of their federal and state income tax returns.
Available Trust Tax Information
 
In compliance with the Treasury regulations reporting requirements for WHFITs and the dissemination of Trust tax reporting information, the Trustee provides a generic tax information reporting booklet which is intended to be used only to assist Trust unitholders in the preparation of their federal and state income tax returns. This tax information booklet can be obtained at www.permianvilleroyaltytrust.com.
Environmental Matters and Regulation
 
General. For purposes of the discussion in this section, the oil and natural gas production operations conducted on the properties that are subject to the Net Profits
 
9




Interest are referred to as the Sponsors operations. The Sponsors oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose significant obligations on the Sponsors operations, including requirements to:
 
·                                          obtain permits to conduct regulated activities;
 
·                                          limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas;
 
·                                          restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment in the performance of drilling, completion and production activities;
 
·                                          initiate investigatory and remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former or current operations, such as restoration of drilling pits and plugging of abandoned wells; and
 
·                                          apply specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection.
 
Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of significant administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties, the imposition of joint and several liability, investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of the Sponsors operations. Moreover, these laws, rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. The Sponsor has advised the Trustee that it believes that it is in substantial compliance with all existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to its current operations and that its continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the cash distributions to the Trust unitholders. While the Trump Administration has taken steps aimed at reducing federal regulatory burdens and costs for oil and natural gas production operations, the recent trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly construction, drilling, water management, completion, emission or discharge limits or waste handling, disposal or remediation obligations could have a material adverse effect on the Sponsors development expenses, results of operations and financial position. The Sponsor may be unable to pass on those increases to its customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of the Sponsors operations, and there can be no assurance that the Sponsor will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons.
 
The following is a summary of certain existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which the Sponsors business operations are subject.
 
Hazardous substance and wastes. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Under CERCLA, these responsible persons may include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and entities that transport, dispose of or arrange for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances released at the site. These responsible persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The Sponsor generates materials in the course of its operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances.
 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state laws regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, most states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, production and development of crude oil or natural gas are currently regulated under RCRAs non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes (E&P Wastes) now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. In accordance with a December 2016 settlement agreement, the EPA agreed to decide by March 2019 whether to revise the EPAs current determination exempting oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA. While the EPA has not taken any action toward changing the status of oil and gas wastes under RCRA, any such change could result in an increase in the costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on the cash distributions to the Trust unitholders. In addition, the Sponsor generates industrial wastes in the ordinary course of its operations that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. Such wastes must be properly tested, characterized and disposed of according to state and federal regulations.
 
The properties upon which the Sponsor conducts its operations have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years. Although the Sponsor and, as applicable, the Sponsors predecessor, Enduro, may have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes may have been disposed of or released at or from the real properties upon which the Sponsor conducts its operations, or at or from other, offsite locations, where these petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, the properties upon which the Sponsor conducts its operations may have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons was not under the Sponsors control. These properties and the petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes disposed or released at or from these properties may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, the Sponsor could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, to clean up contaminated property and to perform remedial operations such as restoration of pits and plugging of abandoned wells to prevent future contamination or to pay some or all of the costs of any such action.
 
                              Water discharges. The Clean Water Act (CWA) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by EPA and/or an analogous state agency. The term waters of the United States has been broadly defined to include certain inland water bodies, including certain wetlands and intermittent streams. The discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, is also prohibited, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACE). CWA Section 401 provides that the applicant for an individual National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit to be issued by the EPA or an individual Section 404 permit to be issued by the ACE must notify the state in which the discharge will occur and provide an opportunity for the state to determine if the discharge will comply with the states approved water quality program. In some instances this process could result in delay in issuance of the permit, more stringent permit requirements, or denial of the permit.
 
In September 2015, new EPA and ACE rules defining the scope of the waters of the United States, and the EPAs and the ACEs jurisdiction, became effective (2015 Rule). The 2015 Rule has been challenged in multiple courts on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of CWA programs. Due to the status of pending litigation, the 2015 Rule is currently in effect in 22 states. In the remaining states, regulations in effect before promulgation of the 2015 Rule and guidance interpreting relevant United States Supreme Court rulings are in effect.   On December 11, 2018, the heads of the EPA and ACE signed a proposed regulation that would revise the definition of waters of the United States to reduce its reach from the 2015 Rule (2018 Pre-Proposal Rule). The fates of the 2015 Rule and the 2018 Pre-Proposal Rule and applicability of the rules during current and future litigation are uncertain; however, to the extent the 2015 Rule is in effect, it expands the scope of CWA jurisdiction, and COERT could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas or other waters of the United States.
 
Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure (SPCC) plan requirements imposed under the CWA require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of waters of the United States in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In
 
10




addition, the CWA and analogous state laws required individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. In June 2016, the EPA issued a final rule implementing wastewater pretreatment standards that prohibit onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities from sending wastewater directly to publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). Unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities can send wastewater to a private wastewater treatment facility that can either discharge treated wastewater or send it to a POTW. The EPA is conducting a related study of treatment of oil and gas extraction wastewater at private wastewater treatment facilities. This restriction of disposal options for hydraulic fracturing waste and other changes to CWA requirements may result in increased costs to the Sponsor. In addition, naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) is brought to the surface in connection with oil and gas production. Concerns have arisen over traditional NORM disposal practices (including discharge through publicly owned treatment works into surface waters), which may increase the costs associated with management of NORM.
 
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or OPA, amends the CWA and establishes strict liability and natural resource damages liability for unauthorized discharges of oil into waters of the United States. OPA requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare Facility Response Plans for responding to a worst-case discharge of oil into waters of the United States.
 
Hydraulic fracturing. Various federal and state initiatives are underway to regulate, or further investigate, the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing, a practice that involves the pressurized injection of water, chemicals and other substances into rock formation to stimulate production of oil and natural gas. The U.S. Congress has considered legislation to amend the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to subject hydraulic fracturing operations to regulation under the SDWAs Underground Injection Control Program and to require the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Any such legislation could make it easier for third parties opposed to hydraulic fracturing to initiate legal proceedings against companies. In addition, the federal government is currently undertaking several studies of hydraulic fracturings potential impacts. The Secretary of Energy Advisory Board published their ninety-day report that included a number of recommendations. In December 2016, the EPA issued a final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The report did not find widespread, systematic impacts to drinking water from hydraulic fracturing; at the same time, the report acknowledged information gaps that limited EPAs ability to fully assess the potential impacts to drinking water resources. In addition, as noted above, the EPA in June 2016 issued a final rule implementing wastewater pretreatment standards that prohibit onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities from sending wastewater directly to POTWs. EPA is conducting a related study of oil and gas extraction wastewater at private wastewater treatment facilities. In March 2015, the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) released a final rule establishing new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing operations on federal and tribal lands. Several states, trade groups and companies have challenged the legality of the BLM rule in federal court. On September 30, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming issued a preliminary injunction, blocking BLM from enforcing the new rules nationwide, and on June 21, 2016, the court issued a final ruling striking down the BLM rule. While the U.S. Department of Interior initially has appealed the decision to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. BLM announced in March 2017 that it intended to rescind the rule. On December 29, 2017, BLM published a final rule that rescinded the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule.
 
On August 16, 2012 the EPA published final rules that extend New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) to certain exploration and production operations. The final rule requires the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically-fractured gas wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. In response to some of these challenges, the EPA amended the rule to extend compliance dates for certain storage vessels, and may issue additional revised rules in response to additional such requests in the future. Only a portion of these new rules appear to affect our operations at this time by requiring new air emissions controls, equipment modification, maintenance, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting. Although these new requirements will increase our operating and capital expenditures and it is possible that the EPA will adopt further regulation that could further increase our operating and capital expenditures, we do not currently expect such existing and new regulations will have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial results.
 
Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or impose additional requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, including the disclosure of information regarding the substances used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Such federal or state legislation could require the disclosure of chemical constituents used in the fracturing process to state or federal regulatory authorities who could then make such information publicly available. Disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process could make it easier for third parties opposing hydraulic fracturing to initiate legal proceedings against producers and service providers based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, the Sponsors and the third party operators fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements or operational restrictions and also to associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs. In December 2014, the Governor of New York announced that the state would maintain its moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in the state. Further, some local governments, including in Texas, have imposed moratoria on drilling permits within city limits so that local ordinances may be reviewed to assess their adequacy to address such activities. No assurance can be given as to whether or not similar measures might be considered or implemented in the jurisdictions in which the Underlying Properties are located.
 
                              Air emissions. The federal Clean Air Act (CAA) and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources through air emissions permitting and regulatory programs and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require the Sponsor to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air emissions permit requirements or incur development expenses to install and utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. For example, the EPA in 2012 adopted federal New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) that require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from certain fractured and refractured natural gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions, also known as green completions. These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule adopting additional NSPS requirements for new, modified, or reconstructed oil and gas facilities that require control of the greenhouse gas methane from affected facilities, including requirements to find and repair fugitive leaks of methane emissions at well sites (Methane Rule). Following the 2016 presidential election and change in administrations, in 2017 the EPA proposed to delay implementation of the Methane Rule and also convened a reconsideration proceeding that resulted in two 2018 rulemaking projects aimed at rolling back certain Methane Rule requirements. These actions, like the Methane Rule itself, have been, or are likely to be, challenged in courts. The ultimate fate of the Methane Rule requirements is unclear. Nevertheless, regulations promulgated under the CAA may require the Sponsor to incur development expenses to install and utilize specific equipment, technologies, or work practices to control emissions from its operations, which could reduce the profits available to the Trust and potentially impair the economic development of the Underlying Properties. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Federal and state regulatory agencies may impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal CAA and associated state laws and regulations.
 
Climate change. Recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases or GHGs, and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the Earths atmosphere. In response to the scientific studies, international negotiations to address climate change have occurred. In December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The Paris Agreement (adopted at the conference) calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and GHG emissions. If ratified, the Paris Agreement will take effect in 2020. The United States ratified the Paris Agreement in September 2016; however, the countrys future participation in the Paris Agreement is uncertain. In June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, but that it may enter into a future international agreement related to GHGs. In August 2017, the State Department officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Such withdrawal has not yet been finalized, and whether the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement is unclear at this time. Further, several states and local governments remain committed to the principles of the Paris Agreement in their effectuation of policy and regulations. It is not possible at this time to predict how or when the United States might impose restrictions on GHGs as a result of the Paris Agreement.
 
Both houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs
 
11




work by requiring either major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. These allowances would be expected to escalate significantly in cost over time. Although it is not possible at this time to predict when Congress may pass climate change legislation, any future federal or state laws that may be adopted to address GHG emissions could require the Sponsor to incur increased operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas the Sponsor produces.
 
The EPA has also taken regulatory action aimed at reducing GHG emissions. In December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, which has allowed the EPA to adopt and implement regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. For example, the EPA adopted regulations under Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V permitting programs for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources. In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that GHG emissions alone cannot trigger an obligation to obtain a federal air permit, but the Court upheld EPAs authority to regulate GHG emissions from major stationary sources where emissions of traditional criteria pollutants exceed federal permitting thresholds. In November 2010, the EPA published its final rule expanding the existing GHG monitoring and reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and natural gas processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. These requirements became applicable in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. The Underlying Properties may be subject to these requirements or become subject to them in the future. Meanwhile, as noted above, in June 2016 the EPA finalized the Methane Rule. Following the 2016 presidential election and change in administrations, however, in 2017 the EPA proposed to delay implementation of the Methane Rule, and also convened a reconsideration proceeding that resulted in two 2018 rulemaking projects aimed at rolling back certain Methane Rule requirements. These actions, like the Methane Rule itself, have been (or are likely to be) challenged in courts. The ultimate fate of the Methane Rule requirements is unclear. Nevertheless, regulations promulgated under the CAA may require the Sponsor to incur development expenses to install and utilize specific equipment, technologies, or work practices to control emissions from its operations. In addition, in November 2016, the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued final rules to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas operations on federal and tribal lands that are substantially similar to the EPAs Methane Rule. However, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule to temporarily suspend or delay certain requirements contained in the November 2016 final rule until January 17, 2019, including those requirements relating to venting, flaring and leakage from oil and gas production activities. Further, in September 2018, the BLM published a final rule revising or rescinding certain provisions of the 2016 rule. Although the future implementation of the EPA and BLM rules aimed at controlling GHG emissions from oil and natural gas sources remains uncertain, future federal GHG regulations for the oil and gas industry remain a possibility given the long-term trend towards increasing regulation.
 
Because regulation of GHG emissions is relatively new, further regulatory, legislative and judicial developments are likely to occur. Such developments may affect how these GHG initiatives will impact the Sponsors operations. In addition to these regulatory developments, recent judicial decisions that have allowed certain tort claims alleging property damage to proceed against GHG emissions sources may increase the Sponsors litigation risk for such claims. The adoption of any future regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise limit emissions of GHGs from the equipment and operations of the Sponsor could require the Sponsor to incur costs to monitor and report on GHG emissions or reduce emissions of GHGs associated with its operations, and such requirements also could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that the Sponsor produces.
 
Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for the Sponsors products by making its products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. To the extent that its products are competing with higher greenhouse gas emitting energy sources, the Sponsors products would become more desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. In August 2015, the EPA issued standards designed to limit GHG emissions from new power plants as well as the Clean Power Plan aimed at reducing GHG emissions from existing power plants. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan pending judicial review, and President Trump has been vocal in opposition to the Clean Power Plan. In October 2017, following a review directed by President Trumps Energy Independence Executive Order, the EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan regulations. To the extent that its products are competing with lower greenhouse gas emitting energy, the Sponsors products would become less desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. The Sponsor cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect its operations.
 
Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earths atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could adversely affect or delay demand for the oil or natural gas produced by the Sponsor or otherwise cause the Sponsor to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.
 
National Environmental Policy Act. Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended (NEPA). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. However, for those current activities as well as for future or proposed exploration and development plans on federal lands, governmental permits or authorizations that are subject to the requirements of NEPA are required. This process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.
Endangered Species Act. The federal Endangered Species Act and similar state statutes restrict activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. The presence of endangered species or designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause the Sponsor to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans in the affected areas.
 
Employee health and safety. The operations of the Sponsor are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
