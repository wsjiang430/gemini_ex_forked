ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Company History

One Stop Systems, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “OSS,” or the “Company”) was originally incorporated as a California corporation in 1999, after initially being formed as a California limited liability company in 1998. On December 14, 2017, the Company was reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in connection with its initial public offering. The Company designs, manufactures, and markets specialized high-performance compute and storage hardware, software, and systems, which are designed to target edge artificial intelligence (“AI”) Transportable deployments. The Company markets its products to manufacturers of automated equipment used for autonomous vehicle, medical, industrial, and military applications, with special focus on platforms that move, such as trucks, planes, and mobile datacenters. This rapidly expanding segment of the edge compute and storage market is what we refer to as AI Transportables. If an application needs AI and/or autonomous capabilities, and it moves, OSS delivers the highest performance solutions that are designed to survive and enable these challenging applications.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary in Germany, One Stop Systems, GmbH (“OSS GmbH”). Then, in July 2016, the Company acquired Mission Technologies Group, Inc. (“Magma”) and its operations.
 
On August 31, 2018, the Company acquired Concept Development Inc. (“CDI”) located in Irvine, California. CDI specialized in the design and manufacture of custom high-performance computing systems for airborne in-flight entertainment, flight safety equipment, and networking systems. CDI’s business was fully integrated into the core operations of the Company as of June 1, 2020.
 
On October 31, 2018, OSS GmbH acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Bressner Technology GmbH, a limited liability company registered under the laws of Germany and located near Munich, Germany (“OSS Europe”). OSS Europe designs and manufactures standard and customized servers, panel PCs, and PCIe accelerator systems. Although, currently, OSS Europe primarily serves as a value-added reseller for the Company in Europe, we are also focused on growing the AI Transportable portion of our business through OSS Europe and leveraging its existing relationships. OSS Europe also provides manufacturing, test, sales, and marketing services for customers throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”).
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 2235 Enterprise Street, Suite 110, Escondido, California 92029, and our telephone number is (760) 745-9883. Our website address is www.onestopsystems.com. Information contained in, or accessible through, our website is for reference purposes only.

Business Overview
 
One Stop Systems, Inc. (“OSS” or the “Company”) designs, manufactures, and markets specialized high-performance compute and storage hardware, software, and systems, which are designed to target edge AI Transportable deployments. Edge computing is a form of computing that is done on site, near a particular data source or the user (rather than in the cloud), minimizing the need for data to be processed in a remote data center. This growing trend increases computing performance and security, as the data does not have to travel to distant data center location. These specialized modules and systems consist of computers and storage products that incorporate the latest state-of-the art components with our embedded proprietary software. Such modules and systems allow our customers to offer high-end computing capabilities (often integrated within their equipment) to their target markets and applications.

The fast-growing edge computing space consists of three major segments. The first segment is comprised of many smaller data centers located near the users (or on the edge). These typically include compute and storage racks in environmentally controlled buildings, similar to large cloud data centers. Suppliers in this space tend to be the same large server and storage manufacturers whose products are used at cloud data centers. The second segment includes billions of Internet-of-Things (“IOT”) devices that may reside in everything from home appliances to the factory production floor. These IOT devices and applications tend not to be challenged on performance and easily communicate up to the cloud or the data centers on the edge. OSS does not focus on either of the foregoing segments. The third segment is called AI Transportables. These are primarily on land, in the air or at sea vehicles that need performance without compromise for AI and Autonomous capabilities. This is where OSS’ vision and strategy is aligned, and where we believe that we offer the greatest unique value to our customers.
 

Examples of applications that utilize AI Transportables range from industrial autonomous trucks, mining equipment and smart agricultural equipment to military land, sea, and airborne vehicles. Less mobile applications that utilize AI Transportables include items like medical equipment and mobile command centers. There is currently a growing demand for AI/autonomous capabilities within the commercial/industrial market, as well as for military use.
 
The AI and/or autonomous capabilities require these demanding applications to connect to a wide array of data sources and sensors, and to have the ability to quickly access and store large ever-growing data sets. They must be able to maintain ultra-fast processing power to act on data in real time at the edge location, which is independent of whether a high-speed network, like 5G, connects the edge application back to the distant central data centers. Standard servers and storage systems available in the market do not address, and typically will not survive, the AI Transportable requirements. Although the network, if it exists, may transfer data, or be used for updates, the latency is not acceptable for many of these applications where time is of the essence. This increases the need for data center type performance using the latest generation of products from companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel. In most of these applications, available space is limited and the number of inputs from sensors and other data sources are significant, thus, requiring high speed input/output (“I/O”) expansion like the latest in PCI Express, which OSS is known for in the market. In the case of vehicles, fuel efficiency, and particularly, in the case of aircraft, AI Transportables come into play due to the need for lower weight materials. Additionally, the mobility of these systems creates the need for the equipment to survive drops, g-forces, vibration, dust, wide temperature swings, and moisture.
 
While other edge computing suppliers may serve the needs of the environmentally controlled edge data centers with the latest technology, the deployment of the same performance level in the AI Transportable space requires unique capabilities and knowhow, which is where we believe that we excel. Many companies that enter this space tend to offer solutions based on older and lower performance technology, whereas we advance our proprietary state-of-the-art technologies and utilize the latest generation of products to ensure superior performance. We leverage our proven track-record of delivering first-to-market advanced technologies and technical strength, working with the latest high-speed networks like PCI Express 5.0 and NVIDIA’s NVLink. This is in addition to our expertise with rugged servers, compute acceleration and high-performance flash array storage systems. When combined with our execution and knowledge for deploying these systems in challenging environments, we bring the latest commercially available technology and products to this market. Unlike the edge or cloud data centers in a building, these applications involve various unique requirements, playing to our strength and creating opportunities for additional barriers of entry.
 
Although in the past we have also designed and built custom servers with custom connectors and video media outputs for use in the media and entertainment industry, we are transitioning away from this lower margin business sector in order to concentrate on the AI Transportables sector.

Business Strategy
 
In March 2021, after reviewing our current business, market trends, the competitive landscape, reflecting on our strengths, as well as listening to feedback from current and potential customers, we determined that it would be in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders to shift our primary focus to the development and sale of AI Transportables. At that time, 20% of our business was already in the AI Transportables space. Our AI Transportables business accounts for some of our highest margins, repeat business, highest closure rate, and most importantly, we believe that it represents our highest value proposition when bringing together all our skills and experience.

Although we are seeing progress, it will take time to pursue, secure, and turn these target opportunities into increased revenue and profits, we believe our focus provides us with a unique opportunity to drive shareholder value. We are not abandoning current profitable business in the process, but are primarily focusing on this market segment for future growth. We believe the implementation of the new strategy and vision can drive this portion of our business from approximately 30% of our business today, to over 50% in the coming years by providing an opportunity for a higher growth rate, margins, and profits. This starts with identifying and closing opportunities in this space. Approximately 75% of our 2022 major account wins and 60% of our current pipeline of major account prospects, which are not yet closed, fall within the AI Transportables space.

We see opportunities in both the commercial/industrial and military/government segments. Currently, our military business accounts for approximately 25% of our overall sales, but we anticipate this will grow to 50% over the next few years. Although the overall military budget will likely vary depending on the administration and global tensions, both of which can impact how many new aircraft carriers or tanks are built, we believe the priority will remain on implementing AI throughout the military theater, and that military funding in this segment is more likely to grow than decrease as the United States continues to be competitive with China.
 
A key element of our product strategy is technological product leadership. We believe a first-to-market strategy is key to our ability to continue to win significant original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) opportunities. As a result, we continue to develop new state-of-the-art products, providing a unique value proposition for our customers in the targeted space. In November 2021, we introduced Rigel, the Super Edge Computing platform. We believe that this product is currently the highest performance, most compact supercomputer that can survive the most demanding next generation military programs available today. It brings to market the latest in Graphics Processing Units (“GPU”), Central Processing Unit (“CPU”), and memory products in a rugged compact form factor, which targets the military AI Transportable space. In 2022, Rigel was vetted by multiple large military prime contractors as well as the U.S. Department of Defense directly for key, high visibility programs that we are pursuing. Current engagements for our products in the military space cover various applications, including for multiple aircraft, drones, ships, helicopters, and land vehicles, as the Pentagon prioritizes incorporating advanced technologies into their equipment to add autonomous and AI capabilities throughout the military.
 
In 2022, we introduced the Centauri rugged storage expansion product, which has been deployed now by several autonomous truck companies, two of which are among our top ten accounts. Additionally, the short depth server (SDS) rugged space optimized server was introduced and has secured major design wins across commercial and military applications delivering high-performance GPU based AI capability in harsh environments.
 
Our ability to drive the leading edge of technology is enabled by our strong relationships with strategic component manufactures, including NVIDIA (for GPUs, ARM processors and networking), NetList, and Micron (for flash memory), Broadcom (for PCIe switch components), and Intel and AMD (for CPUs). In many cases, we have access to product roadmaps and other technical information relating to future technology. Access to this information allows us to begin our design process well before the future components we are designing even exist.

We sell our products worldwide to industry-leading customers. We service over 1,800 customers per year worldwide, with major repeat customers including Raytheon, the United States Navy, Thales, Liqid, and Alcon/Novartis. OSS Europe has aided in the expansion of our business within the European market. Although, currently OSS Europe primarily serves as a value-added reseller for the Company, we are also focused on growing the AI Transportable portion of our business through OSS Europe and leveraging its existing relationships.

We anticipate that the steps we have taken since implementing our new strategy in March 2021 and the fast growing markets that we are pursuing will provide accelerated revenue and margin growth for the Company over the coming years.

Industry Background and Market Opportunity
 
The notion of network-based computing dates to the 1960s, but many believe the first use of “cloud computing” in its modern context occurred in 2006 when Google’s then-CEO, Eric Schmidt, introduced the term during an industry conference. Years later, the explosive growth of IoT connected devices, along with new applications that require real-time computing power, started to create the drive for edge-computing systems. As the demand for AI on the edge and autonomous vehicles grew, so did the need for high-performance solutions to operate in harsh environments.

Edge computing is one of the fastest growing markets in the computing space, driven by the need to do more at the edge. The concept of edge computing is simply deploying compute systems closer to the actual user of the system, rather than communicating with a distant cloud computing facility. According to Gartner, Inc., a leader in technology research, only 10% of data was gathered and processed at the edge in 2018; however, it is expected that this number will grow to 75% by 2025. This dramatic change is driving an expected growth of over 38% per year between today and 2028, according to Grand View Research, resulting in an estimated market of $61 billion later this decade.
 
We currently estimate that the market for the AI Transportable portion of the edge computing industry will grow to approximately $1 billion to $5 billion in the coming years. OSS’ objective is to be the technology and market leader in the AI Transportable segment of this market.
 
In addition to the cornerstone high performance rugged server, three technologies are fundamental to the AI Transportable computing space: GPU compute accelerators, flash memory-based storage, and high-speed data acquisition I/O. These technologies enable systems to ingest, process and store data at significantly higher rates than traditional systems. By harnessing large quantities of these components, companies can receive necessary data analyses much more quickly and in a more secure manner, and as a result, turn raw data into actionable intelligence. Industry experts typically divide the high-performance computing market into the following categories:
•Servers – This includes all high-end servers and supercomputers. 
 •Storage – Flash-based storage devices primarily.
 •Middleware – A broad category of software encompassing programming environments, schedulers, and other tools outside the operating system. 
 •Applications – Specific software applications for high-performance edge computing. 
 •Services – All services associated with this space. 
 The AI Transportable markets tend to implement AI, autonomous, and/or semi-autonomous capabilities. We believe markets for these products are large and growing. Applications deploying these technologies today, or that we expect to do so in the future, include:
•Commercial/Industrial- Trucks, buses, trains, aviation, agriculture, mining, medical, oil & gas, etc.
 •Military/Government– Planes, watercraft, mobile command, helicopters, mobile radar, submersibles, vehicles, drones, etc.


We expect these applications to deploy increasingly faster computing systems to meet industry and competitive goals. Whereas the goal used to be for an edge compute platform to perform a single application, such as autonomous navigation, now this has been expanded to include five or more AI applications running simultaneously. This expansion requires much more compute power and data storage than traditional embedded computers can manage while operating in harsh, challenging, and space constrained environments.
 
Rugged Edge Servers
 
While simple AI applications, such as facial recognition to open a door to a secure area, may run on traditional low power embedded processor, the needs of the AI Transportable applications require datacenter-class server performance brought to a mobile vehicle. The sheer amount and speed of AI data acquisition for operating an autonomous truck or drone aircraft requires multiple high-speed digitizers, high-performance networking, the fastest flash storage devices, and server-class processors. We enable the power of the datacenter to be deployed at the edge without compromising performance by employing groundbreaking cooling technologies operating from various vehicle AC and DC power sources in small spaces.
GPU Compute Acceleration

The capabilities and speed of GPU accelerated computers are driving significant advances in AI and machine learning. Massive amounts of data are collected, stored, and analyzed by today’s sophisticated algorithms. We are enabling the growth of such AI capability through adding scale with rugged systems that complement the highest performance rugged servers.
High Density Solid-State Storage

The proliferation of larger and larger data sets used in edge computing, including AI, is feeding the need for higher capacity and higher performance storage devices. Traditionally, companies have used hard disk drives for their primary storage. Hard disk drive-based systems are being replaced by flash memory-based systems, which offer higher capacity, performance, reliability, and ruggedness. Flash-based storage systems also consume significantly less power.
High Speed Data Acquisition
 
At the front-end of AI Transportable systems is high speed data acquisition technology. Depending on the application, the data can be generated from a wide array of sensors. In the case of an application utilized by autonomous vehicles, data is generated through arrays of video, LIDAR, and radar sensors. In battlefield applications, cameras, radar, sonar, FLIR (infrared), and RF sensors are deployed to generate data. In Medical applications, MRI or CT sensors are deployed to generate data, and in security applications, networks of security cameras produce high volumes of video data.
Key Components of Our Business

Product Development

Our systems are built using the latest CPU, GPU and flash storage technologies that draw upon years of expertise in designing and manufacturing semi-custom as well as standard systems for military and commercial OEMs. We have a history of being first-to-market with many solutions for emerging technologies. Our technological leadership includes linking the different OSS systems together. When PCIe was introduced in 2005, we were the first company to produce PCIe over cable adapters allowing system-to-system communication at the same speed as internal I/O expansion reducing latency significantly. Similarly, in 2018, we introduced the first PCIe Gen 4.0 cable adapters, and in 2019, we introduced the first PCIe Gen 4.0 system building blocks and platforms in which the PCIe Gen 4.0’s ultra-high performance 16.0 GT/s (giga-transfers/second) and signal integrity challenges limits the number of players in this market and creates barriers to entry. Today, we are one of the largest providers of PCIe adapters and expansion components used worldwide. In 2022, we introduced the market’s first PCIe Gen 5.0 cable adapters and the initial set of expansion products utilizing PCIe Gen 5.0, which once again doubles performance to 32.0 GT/s. All of these products maintain the highest performance of communication between our platforms.
 
When GPU technology and solid-state flash were first introduced, we began designing systems that maximized the effectiveness of these technologies. We now produce compute-systems with large numbers of GPUs and flash memory that communicate over PCIe and allow faster processing, data storage, and data retrieval. The more GPUs and flash devices available to a server, the faster that system can process and store data.

We use leading edge, state-of-the art components from major technology providers to design purpose-built systems that solve customer problems in an efficient, cost-effective manner. We apply the component technology provided by Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, Micron, Broadcom, and others to deliver solutions to provide true value to our customers.

Worldwide Sales

We sell our products on a worldwide basis and are supported through a network of direct salespeople, manufacturers’ representatives, resellers, and distribution partners. Sales in North America and Europe are predominately driven by our direct sales force and manufacturers’ sales representatives, whereas sales in Asia are driven through our distribution partners.
 
The acquisition of OSS Europe created a base for us to expand our European operations for sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, and support capabilities.

Our Opportunity

The worldwide edge computing market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 38% to $61 billion by 2028 (Grandview research, “Edge Computing Market Size,” May 2021). Within this market, we are positioned and focused on the AI/autonomous portion at the very edge, which we call AI Transportables, and we believe that this market could be as large as $5 billion within several years. The products we develop to address this market include high performance compute, storage servers, and PCIe acceleration systems that can perform in the most challenging environments. If an application needs AI and/or autonomous capabilities, and it moves, OSS strives to deliver the highest performance solutions that will survive and enable these challenging applications.
Our Technology

We design and manufacture high performance computing systems for use on the AI Transportable edge, which are designed to increase compute performance while surviving in harsh environments. Our high-density compute accelerators connect directly to a server’s PCIe bus, delivering substantial compute performance. Our flash storage arrays support hundreds of terabytes of high-speed storage that can also be accessed by multiple servers.

Technology Drivers for OSS High-Performance Computing Business

We have developed expertise and core competencies in the three fundamental technology drivers within today’s high-performance edge computing market – high-speed serial interconnect technology, compute acceleration utilizing GPUs, and low latency flash storage. In combination, these three fundamental technologies are changing the economics of computing, bringing high-performance computing within the grasp of a wide range of new industries and commercial applications on the edge. Simultaneously, the emergence of massive amounts of data being generated in each of these industries is pushing the requirement for innovative state-of-the-art technology. We are enabling this technology to be deployed at the edge by merging these fundamental technologies with our expertise in providing system level optimization for meeting requirements for ruggedization, space, weight, and power (“SWAP”) constraints. Our strategy is to be the disruptive leader in the platforms for AI Transportable applications, and our strategy is based on our unique ability to design high-quality, high-performance AI workflow compute/storage engines that can be deployed in harsh dynamic environments, which require unique system level features for vibration, cooling, and power. Our target market, including various types of vehicles that moves on land, in the air or at sea, creates extremely demanding requirements for compute systems, which must be compact, survive the elements and disruptions like vibration, as well as leverage the higher performance capabilities in the market. This is what we believe we do well.
 
We strive to not only provide competitive advantage for companies, but also to address some of the most fundamental challenges in military and industrial applications. We believe that we are well situated to leverage these major industry forces. By exploiting our unique set of expertise in the underpinning technologies of high-performance computing, we strive to continue to deliver industry leading solutions, disruptive at times, and to take advantage of the opportunity to capture a growing market share in this rapidly expanding marketplace.

Switched Serial Interconnect

Switched serial interconnects are the data highways connecting many elements of today’s high-performance computing platforms. At ever increasing speeds, these pathways move data between system’s processing units, storage, networking, and peripheral elements. For high-performance computing, the primary processing, storage, and peripheral interconnect is PCIe. PCIe Gen 5.0 has an ability to run up to 16 lanes in parallel, which allows up to 128 gigabytes (full duplex) per second bandwidth between system elements. We introduced products based on PCIe Gen 5.0 during 2022, which doubles the system bandwidth over PCIe Gen 4.0.
 
Compute Acceleration with GPUs
 
GPUs have evolved from graphics display acceleration to becoming general-purpose processing workhorses for high-performance computing systems. Today, the majority of the fastest supercomputers in the world utilize GPUs as their primary compute engines. GPUs are ideal for high-performance computing workloads including AI training and inference because of their ability to complete massively parallel processing. While today traditional CPUs may have dozens of processing cores, GPUs have thousands of cores that are able to execute calculations simultaneously.

NVIDIA, a key supplier of GPUs to the market, lists more than 400 such applications across a broad set of market spaces along with focused teams on specific industries of high growth potential such as their NVIDIA Drive team for autonomous navigation. Main markets serviced by NVIDIA GPUs include, without limitation:
•Autonomous navigation;
 •Computational finance;
 •Climate, weather and ocean modeling; 
 •Computational chemistry and biology; 
 •Data science and analytics; 

•Deep learning and machine learning; 
 •Federal defense and intelligence; 
 •Genomics; 
 •Manufacturing; 
 •Media and entertainment; 
 •Medical imaging; 
 •Oil and gas; and
 •Safety and security. 
 
While NVIDIA is focused on the deployment of their GPUs in data centers and for gaming purposes, we are focused on taking this capability to the AI Transportable edge, expanding the overall market significantly. Many of these applications also scale performance, based on the number of GPU components utilized. We have designed multi-GPU systems, including up to 16 GPUs in a single system. Current state-of-the art GPUs (NVIDIA H100) provide over 48 teraflops (FP64) of performance, with future products expected to dramatically increase overall processing capabilities in the years to come.

GPUs also pose significant system design challenges due to their high-power requirements. High-end GPUs can require 500 – 700 watts of power or more, which generates a tremendous amount of heat. Sophisticated power distribution and cooling designs are required, especially for large-scale systems with multiple GPUs per chassis. OSS has significant expertise in addressing these challenges.
 
PCI Express Flash Storage – NVMe protocol
 
The use of flash memory technology for system storage has gained traction over the past decade, which we believe to be a result of the continuous decline in the cost per gigabyte. Flash memory is now becoming the ubiquitous storage technology in high-performance systems.

Combined with the move away from traditional rotating hard drive technology, there has been the trend toward eliminating traditional storage protocols in favor of low latency flash memory protocols. Newer flash memory modules utilize a protocol known as NVMe, which connects the flash memory directly to the system’s PCIe interconnect. This direct connection allows for very high bandwidth between the storage and the other system elements, which eliminates the need for protocol translation as data moves from storage subsystems to and from the compute complex.
 
Today, flash memory modules with capacities up to 32 terabytes and PCIe Gen 4.0 interfaces are now available. PCIe Gen 5.0 devices are expected to be available for purchase in 2023. Our flash storage arrays with hundreds of terabytes of capacity are available enabling the scaling of high-speed storage to meet the full range of high-performance edge application requirements.

OSS leverages the latest technology to build complete storage systems, including all the software to provide the highest density and performance in a compact form factor ideal for vehicles of all types. This, combined with our hot swappable canisters, has enabled many autonomous truck and military aircraft applications.
 
Our Core Technical Capabilities

We have developed unique expertise and core competency across the fundamental technologies of today’s rapidly expanding specialized high-performance edge computing marketplace. These valuable assets are embedded in the leading-edge engineering capabilities of our engineers, the proprietary intellectual property residing in our vast library of designs, and our brand equity based on our reputation as a high-quality producer of state-of-the-art, custom and standard solutions across a broad array of markets.
High Speed System Interconnect Design

Our electrical engineers are experts in high-speed digital signaling design. They have continually designed at the leading edge of the state-of-the-art signaling speeds, even as semiconductor technology has driven up the clock rate of digital transmission. We have consistently been among a small handful of companies able to come to market first with the latest
technology. In fact, we delivered the industry’s first PCIe over cable solutions for PCIe Gen 1.0, Gen 2.0, Gen 3.0, Gen 4.0, and Gen 5.0, which we deployed in 2022. The expertise required includes circuit design, PCB (printed circuit board) layout and routing optimizations, all of which focus on achieving the highest levels of signal integrity. In our current systems, PCIe Gen 5.0 signals are propagated across multiple PCBs, connectors, and copper cabling, while maintaining the ability to recognize digital signal transitions at 32 billion times per second.

In high-performance computing systems, especially those systems that operate on the edge, the trajectory and need for ever-increasing signaling speeds is continuing; provided, however, the number of companies that have the capability to design robust, highly reliable systems at speeds that can tolerate the harsh conditions on the edge are continuing to decline. We believe our core competency in large-scale, high-speed design, and layout will allow us to remain on the forefront of this growing industry.

Complex System Design

In addition to low-level signal integrity design expertise, we have amassed expertise and intellectual property in high-performance system architecture design. This expertise allows us to develop extremely sophisticated systems with massive scaling, while also meeting customer demands for reliability, cost, and flexibility. To do so, we have developed deep knowledge for high-capacity input/output systems, operating system adjustments, and required configuration tuning. Due to this development, our engineers are often called upon to co-design with OEM designers to create the perfect solution to fit the needs of their customers.

For highly scalable systems, a deep understanding and experience with switching topologies and interconnect fabric design is required. We have worked with serial switching technology, starting with the first generation of PCIe, and have been an innovator in creating unique and flexible topologies to meet the specific needs of customers. Creating custom solutions for unique customer solutions is a core competency at OSS, and we rely on this deep knowledge of switch capabilities and limitations.

For maximum system performance, design for optimizing data transfer speeds is also an important consideration. We have developed expertise in system design to leverage peer-to-peer data flows between GPUs and pioneering techniques for optimized data flows between flash storage and GPU compute-engines. Our systems optimize switch and GPU configuration topologies to optimize GPU-to-GPU communication without requiring latency-inducing data transfer between host dual processors. Our platforms feature RDMA (remote direct memory access) across compute-nodes, which support data transfer without burdening the host CPU, as well as NVMe over Fabrics for efficient data transfer from remote storage to compute.

We have pioneered the ability to extend the PCIe bus beyond the confines of a single enclosure, opening the possibility of flexible system expansion options. We believe we are one of the leading designers and suppliers of PCIe host bus adapters that extend PCIe signals from the host motherboard across copper or optical cables to expansion enclosures, which provide application acceleration through scale. Our adapters provide both ends of the external cable connection. Our expertise in high-speed signal design in printed circuit boards, connectors, and cables is essential to successful expansion designs. We also hold expertise in incorporating clustering and rack scale expansion into our system designs, including 200/400 gigabit Ethernet, 200/400 gigabit InfiniBand, and emerging PCIe top-of-rack switch technology.
 
Expertise in power, cooling, and mechanical design are required to address the requirements of the high-performance computing customers, especially while meeting the constrained time requirements of AI Transportable deployments. We have developed leadership design capability in high-power design and distribution within large rack enclosures as well as edge optimized configurations. High-end GPUs today require 500 watts or above, and in our high-end systems, up to 16 of GPUs can reside in a single chassis. Thousands of kilowatts of redundant power are required. Power stability and huge thermal loads are some of the critical design issues that must be addressed. Additionally, at the edge for AI applications, a wide range of input power sources need to be supported from standard 110-220 VAC to 270 and 48 VDC for terrestrial vehicles to three phase 400-800Hz AC for airborne applications.
 
We have expertise in power distribution, redundant power, and complex chassis cooling design, including materials selection, airflow simulation, fan technology, and various liquid cooling options including direct to chip conductive cooling and single and dual phase immersion cooling. We have also developed extensive intellectual property to help ensure regulatory compliance of our complex high-performance computing system designs that span across emission, shock, vibration, thermal, humidity, and other environmental requirements that are required for highly reliable and highly available solutions. Our engineers are experts in design for regulatory testing for FCC (Federal Communications Commission), CE (European Conformity), UL (Underwriters Laboratories), and Mil-STD (Military Standard) standards. Additionally, we have expertise in rapid prototyping, design for manufacturability, and design for serviceability.

We have expertise in system management software that provides robust monitoring and management of the functions of complex computer systems. In 2022, we introduced the U-BMC, or “Unified Baseboard Management Controller,” which is included in our Rigel edge supercomputer and PCIe Gen 5 4UP products. U-BMC will be standard on all future OSS system-level products. The U-BMC extends the traditional system management paradigm to support GPUs and PCIe switched fabric functions, even if the host is in a separate enclosure. With U-BMC, we provide “single pane of glass” management of complex systems and an open-source Redfish API for easy integration with industry-standard management tools. We expect to continue to expand and enhance our software to create additional value, barriers of entry and stickiness with our program wins.
 
Storage Management Software

Given our hardware design and integration expertise, we believe that our robust software capability allows us to offer more optimized and customized systems. Our Ion Accelerator software design team provides the expertise to deliver full server and storage solutions that produce the highest performance from today’s leading-edge flash storage devices. The Ion Accelerator software allows flash-based modules to be put into a variety of storage and network configurations which can then be accessed by multiple edge servers. The Ion Accelerator software can do this cost-effectively, while preserving the low latency and security that is vital for many mission-critical applications, from secure network boot, database, and transaction processing to massive data collection programs.

Our Products
 
Compute Servers

Within the server sector, we have secured a niche position of building purpose-built specialty servers, which the major server suppliers do not supply, as they require custom tuning and special features that major OEMs cannot easily provide. Our compute servers are designed to provide the highest level of performance that can be deployed in harsh edge environments. Our extensible operating system (“EOS”) line of servers is optimized for supporting a high number of expansion chassis. Servers in this product family have a number of slots that are compatible with the PCIe host bus interface cards that we have developed. These cards enable PCIe connection over cable between the host processor and downstream I/O devices. These servers have custom basic input/output systems (“BIOS”) to ensure they work seamlessly with expansion chassis and support a high number of downstream I/O devices. Our SDS line supports rugged deployment in space constrained environments providing a maximum depth of 20 inches. We believe that our “Rigel Edge SuperComputer” (“Rigel”) is the highest performing, most dense, AI-compute platform that is deployable in extreme environments, including on military aircraft.

GPU computing uses hardware components that are optimized to perform mathematical calculations in a rapid fashion. NVIDIA is the market leader in the design and manufacturing of these components. We work closely with NVIDIA to design and build systems which use multiple GPUs to accelerate applications.

Emerging markets and applications such as AI, image rendering and processing, autonomous vehicles, deep learning, molecular modeling, genomics, advanced visualization, machine learning, and image processing, all benefit from the ability to use GPUs to accelerate the application. We build specialized compute-servers and accelerators used in these emerging growth markets. We estimate these markets to be very large and growing. Because our strategy has been to be first-to-market with the fastest and densest compute appliances, we anticipate our addressable market to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Storage Servers

We also build standard and custom flash storage arrays utilizing our unique know-how in PCIe device fan-out, packaging, cooling, and PCIe-over-cable. We deliver dense, high-performance systems that provide customers with high value and utility in the most demanding, data-intensive operations. These OSS Storage Servers complement our compute servers to provide an end-to-end edge solution for AI workflows.
 
Through a strategic agreement with Western Digital, we acquired an exclusive software license for Ion Accelerator Storage Area Networking ("SAN") source code and software development rights, as well as hired their core engineering team on July 1, 2017. Since acquiring this software asset, we have extended its capability to align with our AI Transportable strategy by adding Network Attached Storage ("NAS"), support for NVMe flash drives, NVMe over Fabric expansion capability, and several encryption methods required for government security applications. We have also implemented a proprietary Follow Me capability for removing a bulk pack of NVMe drives that can be easily transported to another system without rebuilding the data, operating much like a massive capacity USB stick. This provides our flash arrays with a high level of differentiation relating to storage management, latency, portability, and throughput. We provide standard flash array products and have the in-house hardware and software expertise to provide customized systems for demanding applications that are not suitable for standard offerings. For example, we provide products to a large military contractor for integration into military aircraft that requires us to design and manufacture a highly ruggedized mil-spec flash array. The resulting product provides high data density with low weight, a high degree of portability, and security for data protection. We believe our experience and capability in high speed, low-latency, digital signaling via PCIe gives us an edge in providing custom designs to OEMs, military programs, and other special purpose applications.

We believe that because our products are positively differentiated by speed, density, and management features for challenging edge applications, our offerings compete favorably in this market and provide a substantial growth opportunity.

PCIe Expansion and Adaptors

PCIe is the high-speed standard for communications within a computer. This standard defines the signals and connectors (i.e., slots) that are used for computer add-in cards (such as Ethernet or graphics). Traditionally, communication between computers in the network is completed via Ethernet. Although Ethernet is great for large networks, this introduces delays and latency challenges. To keep performance at the highest level, PCIe signaling can also be routed over a cable, allowing expansion input/output slots to be physically located in a separate chassis. This provides for high-performance and low latency, which are essential in this market.
 
Being able to separate the server from the I/O expansion, by using PCIe over a cable, facilitates disaggregation of server functionality. That is, with PCIe, server I/O functions no longer need to be contained in the physical server chassis, but instead, can be separated into a separate chassis and continue to operate at full speed. This offers many advantages over higher latency and power consuming traditional networking communications like Ethernet. From a practical perspective, servers can be connected directly to larger storage arrays or other peripheral devices, with the resulting group of chassis operating as if they were all in the same physical chassis.

We began developing our first PCIe-over-cable adaptor in 2006 and were one of the early providers of PCIe adaptors. We recognized this space as a prime opportunity to utilize our core strengths, such as:
•High-speed board design and layout; 
 •Signal integrity masters;
 •Hardware tuning to improve signal integrity; 
 •Design optimization for low cost; 
 •Rapid design capability; 
 •Rugged to survive in harsh AI Transportable applications;
 •Custom BIOS to support a high number of connected PCIe I/O devices well beyond what can be supported in off the shelf BIOS; and
 •Manufacturing and supply chain management. 
 
This technology has now become a standard within the computer industry, our customers have used our adaptors to connect their custom input/output chassis and achieve performance equivalence as if the input/output was integrated into the server box. This gives designers and integrators a degree of flexibility and utility in architecting computer systems that is unprecedented. We have expanded our PCIe adaptor market in breadth and depth, including making adaptors for many OEM customers.

With our expertise developed in designing adaptor cards, the logical extension of our capability led us to develop a method for expanding the PCIe bus into an external chassis containing one or many expansion slots and using this expansion to provide storage and AI application acceleration. This allows a customer to install multiple standard PCIe boards into a chassis and accelerate their system without having to add additional servers. These are typically GPUs, FPGAs or NVMe drives to create large-scale Compute and Storage appliances. For example, we have developed a product for deployment in a mobile command center, which aggregates large amounts of high frequency data from sensors and allows in the field AI algorithms to operate in real time. This is achieved through a cluster of our Compute and Storage products. A user can now connect a multiplicity of PCIe devices to a single server using a single memory domain, and achieve performance throughput and low latency, which was not possible prior to the introduction of PCIe.
 
We have been a leader in PCIe acceleration through generations 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0. We delivered our initial PCIe Gen 5.0 products in 2022, well ahead of any of our direct competitors. As PCIe evolves through generations 6.0 and beyond, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to continue our leadership role in this market. We have shipped a full line of PCIe Gen 4.0 products since 2020, and anticipate that we will have a full line of PCIe Gen 5.0 expansion solutions shipping in 2023. We currently offer what we believe to be the largest PCIe acceleration product line, with chassis and backplanes that offer expansion from one to 64 slots. Due to its greater data throughput and flexibility of design, we believe this is a growing market, and we intend to maintain our leadership role.

Additional Compute Products
 Through OSS Europe, we provide small form factor IoT and high-performance industrial and panel PCs compute-platforms customizable to meet needs in commercial applications on the edge where space constraint is a fundamental consideration. We also provide ruggedized, mobile tablets and handhelds that meet the specialized requirement for devices deployed at the edge in a diverse set of environmental conditions for commercial and government applications.
Customers
 
We serve a global clientele consisting of multinational companies, governmental agencies, military contractors, and leading technology providers. Some of our key customers are set forth below, illustrating the class of customers we pursue with our sales, product marketing and marketing communications efforts.

Raytheon – We work closely with many of the U.S. Government agencies and prime contractors to bring the latest technologies to mobile edge applications. Raytheon provides an excellent example of how we adapted high-performance computing elements used in air-conditioned datacenters to the rigorous environment encountered in a U.S. Navy aircraft. We worked closely with Raytheon to build a customized NVMe storage array, with drives installed in removable canisters for high-speed sensor data acquisition, encryption, and recording. This massive amount of mission data can then be easily off-loaded upon landing the aircraft and sent to the traditional government data center, which is a significant development given that satellite network links are too slow to handle transmitting that amount of data. To further enhance the data collected, we embarked on a second project with Raytheon to build a GPU accelerated “datacenter in the sky” system to enable mission data collected in the flash array to be analyzed and run through AI algorithms in real time while the mission was in process. This allowed the aircraft and crew to make real time decisions using the same level of processing power available in a ground-based system. Finally, we enhanced that “datacenter in the sky” with a 3-system cluster to provide large scale resources during missions and to carry out multiple AI tasks in real time. These applications are great examples of AI transportable end products. We have continued to enhance and refresh the technology for this program while working on opportunities with other prime contractors, including other mobile applications such as video surveillance, video analytics and autonomous vehicles on land, in the sea and in the air. OSS is currently expanding its footprint within in the military market with multiple new engagements with other prime contractors and the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”) directly. Much of this activity is focused on our Rigel supercomputer, which addresses the needs of autonomy and AI required in the battlefield. Current applications include land vehicles, aircraft, drones, ships, and submersibles.

National Instruments – National Instruments is a market leader and multinational company that produces automated test equipment and virtual instrumentation software. We provide several PCI Express-based interface cards that are branded by National Instruments and used in capturing and controlling sensors that produce AI datasets. We act as an extension to
National Instruments’ engineering group, allowing National Instruments to complete their product roadmap in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Alcon – Alcon is a market leader in the production of computer assisted medical equipment. OSS Europe provides several rugged, purpose-built, high-performance workstations used in performing these AI assisted surgeries. OSS Europe works directly with Alcon engineers to co-design and assist in securing medical certifications for the products that doctors and patient trust for pinpoint accuracy and speed.

disguise - disguise is the leading provider of hardware and software that allows their customers to produce live events, television broadcasts, theater effects, and special effects for concert tours. We have worked with disguise to design purpose-built, rugged servers that act as video controllers to create the virtual and visual effects used in these applications. These edge servers require high performance to create the most demanding effects, but also must be rugged enough to move from venue to venue every night. Events like the Super Bowl halftime show, sporting events, feature films, music videos, broadcast studio, metaverse experiences and numerous musical concerts rely upon disguise controllers, designed, and produced by us to deliver a lasting impression on audiences. We are seeing an acceleration in disguise’s investment in cloud technology and a drive towards less intelligent compute capability at the edge to reduce the costs of their componentry. This is particularly true of their virtual products, which do not require the same level of ruggedization as this system is not typically operated in harsh environments and for which software is being developed to eventually provide a real-time cloud solution. As a result, we expect that disguise will transition to a lower cost, commodity type equipment solution. Although disguise has been a key customer in the past, in line with our current business strategy, we are transitioning away from lower margin product, contract-manufacturing type sales, and thus expect a decrease in the demand for our media and entertainment focused equipment and our expertise in this area in the first half of 2023, and that disguise will no longer be a key customer in the near future.

Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on the identification, engagement, and closure of significant targeted opportunities within the AI Transportables space.

Sales

Our sales efforts consist of five main channels:
•General Sales – OSS and OSS Europe maintain websites, a web store and direct sales teams that sell directly to end-users, primarily in the U.S. and EMEA regions. This includes e-commerce sales via typical web store functionality, outbound calling and direct interaction with customers and potential customers to provide standard and unique solutions that fit their needs. 
 •OEM Focused Sales – Our direct outside sales team, which consists of OSS employees as well as third-party manufacture representatives, is organized to best identify, target, and develop the top potential commercial OEM and government program customers in the AI Transportable Space. These OEM and government programs form the largest and fastest growing parts of our business. The OSS direct sales teams interface directly with new potential customers at their facilities, live events, and virtual industry tradeshows, and present standard solutions and/or proposals for customized solutions (if solid return on investment) to address such customers’ high-performance AI Transportable needs at the edge. 
 •Our Commercial Sales Team – Our commercial sales team focuses on OEM customers to whom we sell standard solutions or design and build customer specified systems based on OSS technology expertise that are branded with the OEM’s name and label. This includes target markets like autonomous semi-trucks, farming, and mining equipment deploying the latest technology. These companies, many of which are market leaders, then resell the products through their own sales channels. We actively seek this type of relationship, which is leveraged as a sales multiplier, allowing us to grow sales at a faster rate without adding as many dedicated sales resources. This tends to be a recurring sales model that lasts several years.
 •Our Government Sales Team – Our government sales team focuses on the large and growing portion of our business that provides systems to DOD programs, global government agencies, and national laboratories. Our government sales team has the knowledge and expertise to identify major program opportunities in the AI Transportable space and provide the extensive technical and business documentation to take these programs from concept to successful completion. This is a growing part of our business, one of our primary focuses, and provides a higher contribution of profit margin. Examples include compute and storage systems for aircraft, radar 

systems, and command centers. Our sales team engages with the large military prime contractors as well as the DOD directly.
 •Channels – We have dedicated sales resources that manage our worldwide network of resellers and distributors, including those distributors that we utilize throughout Asia. We sell a large breadth of standard products through these channels, which allow us to achieve global customer touch without requiring a physical presence in all geographies. The master distributors in several countries have dedicated sales expertise to capture additional OEM business, with both Fortune 500 and second tier OEM firms extending our international footprint. Through OSS Europe, we have a greater direct presence in Europe, which allows greater access to those markets.
 
Marketing Communications

Our marketing communications department is responsible for positioning OSS as an expert, thought leader, and visionary in the AI Transportables market. We generate expert content to support our market leading products, while also building cost effective brand/product awareness in several ways. We use traditional and non-traditional marketing communications, as well as partnerships and word of mouth, to convey the uniqueness and compelling value of our products and services. The AI Transportable market applications we target include AI inference applications in autonomous vehicles, medical equipment, commercial aerospace, defense/government, agriculture, and mining. OSS Europe also targets embedded industrial and IoT customers in the EMEA region. Among the many channels utilized are:
•Trade Shows – OSS participates in several live and virtual tradeshows and events during the year to generate new relationships and foster existing relationships with customers and partners. These engagements allow us to showcase our standard and custom product expertise to our target customers. The target trade shows include AUSA (US Army), Sea-Air-Space (Navy/NASA), Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (autonomous vehicle), MOVE America (autonomous vehicle), AFCEA West (military), DSEI (international military), Supercomputing, Medica (medical), AUVSI (autonomous vehicle) and Embedded World. We evaluate the return on investment (“ROI”) and costs of each show on an annual basis; accordingly, participation may change from year to year. 
 •Electronic Media – OSS uses various forms of electronic advertising media to market both the AI Transportable products and capabilities of the Company. Electronic media includes internal direct email campaigns, such as monthly newsletters and various press releases for new products, technology developments, partnerships and significant application design wins. In addition, we use media companies relevant to our target markets to disseminate information about the Company to a larger set of potential customers. The format of the electronic advertising varies, but with the common focus on content advertising demonstrating our market expertise with a secondary focus on brand awareness. The various electronic media formats that we utilize include, but are not limited to, search engine ads and keyword campaigns, digital ads, display ads, datasheet emails, customer use cases, e-newsletters, and text ads. Our web site is key at leveraging our leadership content, positioning, and search engine optimization (“SEO”) capabilities. We will continue to invest on this front.
 •Social Media – OSS regularly use Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter to instantly alert the Company’s followers to new events, products, services, and customer stories. 
 •Publications – We periodically publish white papers, customer success stories, and other demand generation technology articles in printed and electronic periodicals and newsletters, including, but not limited to, Autonomous Vehicle International, Military Embedded Systems, Edge Industry Review, Aerospace and Defense and Auto News. We also invest in print ads in the EMEA region, with the highest ROI in select industry magazines for brand awareness. 
 
As we grow, it is anticipated our marketing efforts will likewise continue to increase in size and focus on the AI Transportable market.
 
Competition

Our core business is to provide specialized high-performance edge AI computing platforms to OEMs who incorporate these products into their complete solutions, which they then sell to end users in the AI Transportable market. Although a fragmented market, due to the nature of our business, there are a number of categories of potential competitors of our products.
 
Customer in-house design resources

Many of our larger target OEM customers have in-house engineering design resources, which could be used as an alternative to engaging with us. Examples of current OSS customers who have significant in-house resources include National Instruments, Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin. This potential competition is mitigated by the technical specialization that we have, especially in high-end and large-scale PCI Express switch fabrics and PCI Express acceleration capabilities. OEMs can invest their in-house resources on value-add capabilities within their specific vertical market and outsource these horizontal technology capabilities to us. We have also developed a trusted partner relationship with many of these OEMs and have established a market reputation for technical expertise and a responsive and cost-effective engagement model. We win when our customers realize that together we can produce better products faster, more ruggedly, and more cost-effectively than they can by themselves. This has proven to be particularly evident when customers require state-of-the-art products that are constructed of commercially available parts but need to be deployed in harsh mobile environments. This has resulted in several program wins that demonstrate our flexibility and how we can work closely with large OEM and government customers. Interestingly, it appears that when these large companies cut back on their workforce or have limited funding, such events bolster our position, as we may become these companies’ only option to get their desired product or service deployed within a reasonable period.
 
Major Tier 1 & 2 Mainstream Computer, GPU and Storage Vendors
 
These vendors offer mainstream high-performance computing platforms, including servers and storage systems that can address some applications at the edge in our target markets. Typically, they do not, however, offer the enhanced value platforms or customization capabilities that we specialize in to meet unique form factor, power, ruggedization or scale out requirements sought by OEM customers. Generally, these vendors focus on the large, air-conditioned data centers and competing with such vendors based on price/volume, as differentiation is challenging. Our strategy is specifically designed to avoid head-to-head competition in this part of the market with this class of vendors. In some scenarios, we can provide a complementary specialized component or building block, which interfaces with one of these vendors’ mainstream products. Examples of companies in this space include NVIDIA, HP, Dell/EMC, IBM, SuperMicro, Pure Storage, and NetApp.
Vertical High Performance Compute Vendors – Military/Aerospace
 
In certain vertical markets, there are competitors who focus primarily on the high-performance compute (“HPC”) military and aerospace markets. These vendors often provide complete solutions, including both hardware and software, and some specialization in terms of form factor and ruggedization. In these markets, we provide unique capability in terms of scaling of PCI Express components over cable (copper and fiber) that can address unique requirements of specific military or government programs. Many of these competitors use older technologies or low power processors and components in these more challenging environments. We are able to differentiate ourselves from such competitors due to the fact that we deploy the latest high-performance technology which enables us to provide superior products to potential customers in this space. We have also established good relationships with prime contractors or governmental agencies (Raytheon, Lockheed, Boeing, NASA, ONR, L3 and others), which can be important influencers or decision makers on technology selection. Competitors in this space include companies such as Mercury, Crystal, Curtiss Wright, Kontron, Trenton, Core Systems and Systel. In the past, we have been able to offer the latest technology to the rugged edge, which is normally only deployed in commercial applications, well before our competitors by leveraging our “performance, without compromise” strategy.
Manufacturing and Operations

Currently, OSS is certified under AS9100 and OSS Europe is certified under ISO 9001-2015 for “design, manufacture, and supply of industrial computers.” This means we have demonstrated our ability to consistently provide products that meet both customer requirements and applicable government regulations or statutory requirements. AS9100 is the pinnacle of quality management systems recognized by government and aerospace companies world-wide. It also indicates that we have programs and processes in place to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction, as well as continuous improvement and risk mitigation programs that ensure we get better over time.

While OSS primarily utilizes lean principles to drive our manufacturing and assembly process, we recognize the importance of smooth builds and strategic inventory in this current climate of sustained supply chain shortages. One of the key aspects of utilizing lean principles is our application of just-in-time principles to ensure effective ordering and utilization of inventory. This also helps optimize cash flow throughout the manufacturing cycle. Within the manufacturing process, our operations encompass three categories of “builds”:
•Standard Builds – These are builds of standard products that are sold with little or no customization or non-standard features. These are products that are ready to be installed or integrated by the customer upon receipt. 
 •Custom Builds – Custom builds involve a product built to a customer specification at our facilities. Upon receipt, the customer has a unique product that performs all the functions and has the physical dimensions that match their specifications. 
 •Engineering Project Builds – We support the product development process by building models and prototypes of products. Developed by our engineering group, the prototypes can be of standard or custom products. We build these products with the intent of shipping in volume later.
 
We are dedicated to quality and customer satisfaction. Our continuous improvement efforts require us to review products, services, and processes with the idea that minor changes can lead to greater outcomes for our customers. Although we serve the high-end of the rugged edge computing space, we are constantly looking for ways to become more efficient and drive down costs while driving up margins and quality.
 
Research and Development

Our ability to compete successfully in our industry is heavily dependent upon our ability to ensure a continuous and timely flow of competitive products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. We continue to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products that will further drive commercialization. We may also expand the range of our product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and/or acquisitions of third-party businesses and technologies.
 
Our intellectual property research and development is focused on the exploitation of key technologies as they evolve in the marketplace. Our product roadmap reflects new technologies for CPUs, GPUs, flash storage, and advanced PCIe switches. We design first-to-market, unique implementations targeted at the AI Transportable market utilizing market leading component technologies. Accordingly, our focus lies not in the capital-intensive development of silicon implementations of technologies (i.e., chips, processors, GPUs, or storage devices), but rather leverages leading-edge technologies and building first-to-market products that fully exploit those technologies to solve customer problems in challenging environments.

Our research and development strategy can be summarized as follows: We drive customer program wins by utilizing new key technologies to develop products that are leading edge and first-to-market and that are designed to solve challenging problems in harsh environments, while working closely with our customers to understand and address their needs.
 
Intellectual Property

Our primary intellectual property value emanates from the more than 600 individual design projects that we have undertaken over the decades since our founding, experience, and knowhow, in addition to trade secrets and copyrights. These designs are archived and cataloged; we rarely begin a new design from scratch, but rather, use our archived and cataloged designs as a starting point to efficiently provide products to our customers. In general, we maintain intellectual property rights with respect to the components of the products we design and sell so that we may continue to use them for future sales and development efforts.
 
Over the years, our team has developed and maintained expertise in high-speed signal design and analysis, electronic and mechanical packaging, PCIe-over-cable, fiber optics transmission, high-speed/density flash arrays, and integration and deployment of GPUs in compute accelerators and servers. This extensive expertise positions us to expand and rationalize our product line to meet the growing and ever-changing high-performance computing market. We believe that the expertise of our staff is a considerable asset closely related to intellectual property, and attracting and retaining highly qualified employees is essential to our business.
 
Markets, Seasonality, and Major Customers
 
Our products and services serve a global clientele consisting of multinational companies, governmental agencies, military contractors, and leading technology providers. Based on recent market experience, it appears there are seasonality factors with deliveries decreasing in January and February each year. At OSS Europe, this is likely a result of Asia’s holiday season, whereas at OSS in the US, this is more of a result of varied government and commercial customer appropriation cycles and the timing of budgets, which tend to be larger later in the year; however, we believe these market factors will continue to evolve and our insight into these trends will improve.


During 2020 2021, in particular, and to an extent in 2022, our business was impacted by the COVID-19 virus. This included reduced demand from some current and potential customers serving specific markets. The media and entertainment industries experienced delayed or canceled live concerts, other large in-person events, and sporting events during the height of the pandemic, which resulted in less demand for their products and services, which consequently resulted in a decrease in demand for our products designed for use in these industries. Fortunately, some of the decrease in demand for our live media and entertainment focused products was offset by growing demand for virtual events, especially in 2022. The commercial aerospace market was also impacted when air travel dropped significantly due to various COVID-19 related factors, such as stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, the fear of being exposed to the virus in an aircraft and later by the shortage of crew members. With aircraft flying at lower capacities or sitting idle, the spending budgets were cut drastically, which decreased the demand for our commercial aerospace customers’ products resulting in a decrease in demand for our products designed for use in the industry. As restrictions have lifted and fears have subsided, the impacts of COVID-19 on our business and that of our customers have also decreased significantly. Although, we cannot currently predict how the pandemic will continue to impact our business in the future, it is not anticipated to have significant impact to our customers and our business in 2023.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, an aggregate of 37.4% and 41.5% of our total consolidated revenues, respectively, were attributable to three customers (disguise, Raytheon and Navy). As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, we expect that demand for our products by, and revenues attributable to, disguise will decrease in 2023 as a result of their investment in cloud technology and drive towards less intelligent compute capability at the edge. A loss or decline in business with either of the other two customers would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We typically provide our products under contract supply agreements or purchase orders. We provide our products, software, and services from our offices located in California, Utah, and Germany.

Materials and Suppliers
 
Although most components essential to our business are generally available from multiple sources, we believe that a loss or limited availability of certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial condition.

Prior to 2021, we did not experience significant delays in the supply or availability of our key materials or components provided by our suppliers, nor did we experience a significant price increase for materials or components. However, in 2021, the worldwide supply shortage created many challenges, resulting in the need for our team to implement different strategies and analyze how we allocate resources. In 2022 and into 2023, we are continuing to experience unavailability of certain critical products and some limited supplies, protracted delivery dates for components, increasing product costs, and changes in minimum order quantities, which creates limitations on our ability to secure product. Shortages have ranged from semiconductors to packing materials for shipping. As a result, we are carrying increased inventory balances to ensure availability of necessary products and to secure pricing. Additionally, products that are in the “work-in-process” stage and the inventory of finished goods have increased due to timing and availability of certain componentry necessary to complete our products. We have worked with suppliers and customers to provide multiple options, including the alternative sourcing of similar products. We manage the business carefully to minimize any material impact to financial performance. For more information, see the section titled, “Risk Factors” found in Part I, Item1A, of this Annual Report.
 
Human Capital Resources, Employees, and Personnel

We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel. To achieve this objective, we strive to provide competitive compensation, benefits, stock participation, and a success driven work environment.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 112 employees, of which 104 were full-time and 8 were part-time employees. Seventy-two of our employees were domestic and twenty-eight were international. Our employees include highly skilled engineers, technicians, assemblers, and support staff. Despite recent staffing challenges that have plagued the industry that we operate in, which have generally resulted in greater turnover throughout the industry, we are proud of the low voluntary turnover rate of our personnel to date, as we endeavor to continue to challenge our team and encourage input and creative thinking by all. Our management team strives to provide transparency to our employees through regular meetings designed to update employees on current metric driven results and future expectations. None of our employees are covered by
a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be strong.

Environmental Matters
 
No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from our operations and it is not anticipated that our operations will be materially affected by federal, state, or local provisions concerning environmental controls. Our costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material.

Furthermore, we do not believe that compliance with existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our business or markets that we serve, nor on our results of operations, capital expenditures, earnings, competitive position, financial position, or any of our operations. However, we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.

Government Approval and Effect of Government Regulations
 
Because our core business is to provide specialized high-performance edge computing building blocks and platforms to OEMs who incorporate these products into their complete solutions, which they sell to end users in specific vertical markets, we do not believe that any government agency approval is required for the products and services that we provide to our customers.
 
We believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and that we hold all necessary permits to operate our business in each jurisdiction in which our facilities are located. Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments.

Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not historically had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position. However, governmental regulations, including but not limited to import and export law, privacy laws, customer, and trade regulations, are subject to change and interpretation and may affect our business in the future. For more information, see the section titled, “Risk Factors” found in Part I, Item1A, of this Annual Report.
 
Recent Developments

In the second quarter of 2022, we formed a new strategic advisory board to aid in the acceleration of our pursuit of the AI Transportables market, and the military sector in particular. The advisory board is comprised of retired high-ranking military officials and corporate executives with decades of experience in technology, high performance computing and M&A for the defense, oil & gas, AI and autonomous vehicle industry verticals. Members of the advisory board provide input on product and market strategy, as well as help us navigate government bureaucracy and identify/introduce us to key decision makers, all with the goal of accelerating our success through their contacts, knowledge and experience. Please see the section of this Annual Report entitled “Advisory Board Members,” below, for information regarding each of the members of our advisory board.

Furthermore, in the first quarter of 2023, we implemented certain internal organizational changes to align our US-based operations with, and to further support and accelerate, our strategy to focus on the AI Transportables industry, and our military business in particular. In furtherance of this strategy and our goals, we have taken various steps to strengthen our management team with individuals who have deep experience and high-level contacts in the defense sector. In connection with this transition, on February 9, 2023, we announced that David Raun, the Company’s chief executive officer, will be stepping down, effective upon the appointment of his successor. Mr. Raun will continue to serve as a member of the Company’s board of directors. Additionally, in connection with this transition, we also (i) appointed James Ison, our chief marketing and sales officer, as our chief product officer, (ii) initiated a search for a vice president of sales, (iii) implemented a reduction in force, consisting of 12 employees, in those areas of our business that we are transitioning our focus away from; and (iv) made certain other internal structural changes.

We have not yet identified a candidate to fill the roles of chief executive officer or a vice president of sales; however, we have retained an internationally recognized search firm to aid in this effort. Additionally, in February 2023, our board of directors constituted a new committee of the board, the Strategic Transition Committee, to assist in the identification, transition and retention of a successor chief executive officer, including to work with the engaged search firm to accomplish the foregoing, to provide support to our management team throughout the transition, and to perform other duties as may be necessary or desirable from time to time in connection with the reorganization of the Company. Members of the Strategic
Transition Committee consist of Jack Harrison (chair of the committee), Gioia Messinger and Kenneth Potashner. As compensation for the services that they are expected to perform as members of the Strategic Transition Committee (i) Mr. Harrison and Ms. Messinger shall be entitled to receive $2,000 per month in cash, commencing January 1, 2023 and continuing for so long as the Strategic Transition Committee remains in effect, which cash payments shall be paid to each of the relevant members in one lump sum at or about such time that the Strategic Transition Committee is disbanded, and (ii) Mr. Potashner shall be entitled to receive (A) 3,333 shares of Company common stock per month, commencing November 1, 2022 and continuing for so long as the Strategic Transition Committee remains in effect, which shares shall be issued to Mr. Potashner in one grant at or about such time that the Strategic Transition Committee is disbanded, and (B) a one-time cash payment equal to 30% of the total value of the shares issued to Mr. Potashner to cover taxes payable in connection with the issuance of such shares.

The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from the geopolitical instability caused in part by the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, including inflation and Federal Reserve interest rate increases, have contributed to global supply chain issues and economic uncertainty, which has negatively affected our operations. Additionally, the general consensus among economists continues to suggest that we should expect a higher recession risk to continue for the foreseeable future, which could result in further economic uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets in the near term and could negatively affect our operations.
 
Additionally, in March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank were closed and taken over by the FDIC, which created significant market disruption and uncertainty for those who bank with those institutions, and which raised significant concern regarding the stability of the banking system in the United States, and in particular with respect to regional banks. If other banks and financial institutions enter receivership or become insolvent in the future in response to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents may be threatened and such events could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 
With respect to our media and entertainment business, we are seeing an acceleration in our customer’s investment in cloud technology and a drive towards less intelligent compute capability at the edge to reduce the costs of their componentry. This is particularly true of their virtual products, which do not require the same level of ruggedization as this system is not typically operated in harsh environments and for which software is being developed to eventually provide a real-time cloud solution. As a result, we expect that our customer will transition to a lower cost, commodity type equipment solution. We anticipate that we will begin to experience a decrease in the demand for our high-compute, ruggedized media and entertainment focused equipment and our expertise in this area in the first half of 2023.
 
Currently, we are continuing to experience increased pricing, longer lead-times, unavailability of product and limited supplies, protracted delivery dates, changes in minimum order quantities to secure critical product, and/or shortages of certain parts and supplies that are necessary components for the products and services we offer to our customers. As a result, the Company is carrying increased inventory balances to ensure availability of necessary products and to secure pricing.
 
These global issues and concerns regarding general economic decline or recession are also impacting some of our customers, who are experiencing downturns or uncertainty in their own business operations and revenue, and as a result, these customers may need to decrease or delay their technology spending, request pricing concessions or payment extensions, or seek to renegotiate their contracts.
 
As a result of these global issues, as well as other factors discussed in this Annual Report, it has been difficult to accurately forecast our revenues or financial results, especially given the near and long-term impacts of the pandemic, geopolitical issues, inflation, the Federal Reserve interest rate increases and the potential for a recession. In addition, while the potential impact and duration of these issues on the economy and our business may be difficult to assess or predict, these world events have resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, and may reduce our ability to access additional capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity in the future. Our results of operations could be materially below our forecasts as well, which could adversely affect our results of operations, disappoint analysts and investors, or cause our stock price to decline.
 
Furthermore, a decrease in orders in a given period, including in connection with our media and entertainment customer’s transition to the cloud, could negatively affect our revenues in future periods. These global issues and events may also have the effect of heightening many risks associated with our customers and supply chain. We may take further actions that alter our operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities from time to time, or which we determine are in our best interests. In addition, we may decide to postpone or abandon planned investments in our business in response to changes in our business, which may impact our ability to attract and retain customers and our rate of innovation, either of which could harm our business.


Management’s plans with respect to the above are to continue their efforts towards responding to the changing economic landscape, to continue to control costs, conserve cash, strengthen margins through the introduction of new product lines focusing on artificial intelligence compute capabilities for military and industrial applications, autonomous truck diving and improve company-wide execution.
