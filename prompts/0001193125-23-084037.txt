ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
 We are a vertically-integrated, multi-state owner and operator of licensed cannabis cultivation, processing and dispensary facilities and a developer, producer and distributor of innovative branded cannabis and cannabidiol (“CBD”) products in the United States. Although we are committed to creating a national retail brand and portfolio of branded cannabis and CBD products recognized in the United States, cannabis currently remains illegal under U.S. federal law. 
 Through our subsidiaries, we currently own and/or operate 35 dispensaries and 11 cultivation and/or processing facilities in nine U.S. states. Pursuant to our existing licenses, interests and contractual arrangements, we have the capacity to own and/or operate up to an additional 15 dispensary licenses and/or dispensary facilities in six states, plus an uncapped number of dispensaries in Florida and up to 21 cultivation, manufacturing and/or processing facilities, and we have the right to manufacture and distribute cannabis products in nine U.S. states, all subject to the necessary regulatory approvals. 
 Our multi-state operations encompass the full spectrum of medical and adult-use cannabis and CBD enterprises, including cultivation, processing, product development, wholesale-distribution and retail. Cannabis products offered by us include flower and trim, products containing cannabis flower and trim (such as packaged flower and pre-rolls), cannabis infused products (such as topical creams and edibles) and products containing cannabis extracts (such as vape cartridges, concentrates, live resins, wax products, oils and tinctures). Our CBD products include topical creams, tinctures and sprays and products designed for beauty and skincare (such as lotions, creams, haircare products, lip balms and bath bombs). Under U.S. federal law, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”). A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. Other than Epidiolex (cannabidiol), a cannabis-derived product, and three synthetic cannabis-related drug products (Marinol (dronabinol), Syndros (dronabinol) and Cesamet (nabilone)), the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has not approved a marketing application for cannabis for the treatment of any disease or condition and has not approved any cannabis, cannabis-derived or CBD products. See Risk Factor – Our products are not approved by the FDA or any other federal governmental authority. 
 Operations 
 Cultivation. We cultivate multiple strains of cannabis plants within our licensed cultivation facilities across the United States. We believe that our facilities are designed, managed and operated to cultivate high-quality products in a cost-effective manner. Our cultivation process uses all parts of the cannabis plant, including flower and trim (“biomass”), to produce cannabis products that we sell at our dispensaries and distribute to third parties on a wholesale basis. We currently have 11 issued cultivation and processing licenses in eight U.S. states, with approximately 488,000 square feet of cultivation and processing space which is fully built-out and the ability to expand to a total of approximately 813,000 square feet of space within our existing lots, subject to regulatory approval. We currently have the ability to harvest approximately 61,000 pounds of biomass annually in our existing cultivation space, and we believe that we will have the ability to harvest approximately 176,000 pounds of biomass annually if we are able to use all of our projected cultivation space, including the cultivation space that is currently under construction and the additional unused cultivation space within our existing lots. 
 Product Development and Processing. We develop and sell cannabis products for medical and adult-use and CBD products for beauty and skincare. Biomass is processed into oil and resin that is used to develop numerous cannabis-extracted products, including vape pen oils, lotions, tinctures, other concentrates and edibles. We typically conduct product development and processing activities within our cultivation facilities and CBD products are manufactured in third-party manufacturing facilities. Processing procedures include developing formulations and packaging for all cannabis branded products, including the brands we own (such as GrowHealthy, 
 
8 


 Black Label and Melting Point Extracts (MPX)), as well as brands that we manufacture and sell pursuant to our white label and/or licensing agreements. 
 Distribution. 
 Wholesale.
We distribute our cannabis and CBD products through our wholesale channel to over 150 dispensaries, including our own dispensaries and other third-party dispensaries in Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts and Nevada. These include our MPX and Black Label branded products. 
 Retail.
We currently own and/or operate 35 dispensaries for the sale of medical and/or adult-use cannabis, CBD and ancillary products. These dispensaries sell products that have been cultivated, developed and processed by us as well as third parties, in states where such sales are permitted. We own and/or operate licensed dispensaries in prime markets, including Atlantic City, Baltimore, Bethesda, Boston, Brooklyn, Las Vegas, Miami, Orlando, Phoenix, Staten Island and West Palm Beach, and we plan to open additional locations in the future. 
 Direct-to-Consumer.
We sell CBD For Life products directly to consumers online at www.cbdforlife.us as well as in retail locations across the United States.

(5) | Florida previously imposed a progressive limit on the number of medical cannabis dispensaries that could be operated by each vertically licensed MMTC based on the number of registered qualified medical cannabis patients in the state. This statutory cap, which permitted 25 dispensaries per MMTC, increasing by 5 dispensaries for each additional 100,000 patients registered in Florida’s Medical Marijuana Use Registry, expired on April 1, 2020. As of April 1, 2020, the MMTC license held by McCrory’s is no longer subject to the statutory cap. Through its vertically integrated MMTC license, McCrory’s currently operates 18 medical dispensaries in Florida.

Growth Strategies and Strategic Priorities 
 Expand retail footprint within existing dispensary license portfolio. We currently have 35 operating dispensaries; however, our licenses permit us to own and/or operate an additional 15 dispensary licenses and/or dispensary facilities in six states, plus an uncapped number of licenses in Florida, all subject to regulatory approval. We have dispensary licenses in key markets throughout the United States including New York City (Brooklyn and Staten Island), Boston, the Washington D.C. metro area (Bethesda), the Tampa and St. Petersburg area, Phoenix, the Miami and Fort Lauderdale area, Orlando, Baltimore and Las Vegas. We intend to expand our operations in Florida, New Jersey and New York. 
 Increase cultivation and processing capacity. We have 11 operational cultivation and/or processing facilities in eight states, with approximately 488,000 square feet of cultivation and processing space which is fully built-out, and the ability to expand to a total of approximately 813,000 square feet of space within our existing lots, subject to regulatory approval. We currently have the ability to harvest approximately 61,000 pounds of biomass annually in our existing cultivation space and we believe that we will have the ability to harvest approximately 176,000 pounds of biomass annually if we are able to use all of our projected cultivation space, including the cultivation space that is currently under construction and the additional unused cultivation space within our existing lots. 
 Increase patient and customer counts per location. We are focused on brand awareness and attracting new and existing patients and customers to our dispensaries and online ordering platforms. Our marketing and sales strategies include medical outreach, industry associations and websites, social media and a variety of other grassroots initiatives. 
 Develop and introduce new products to increase wallet share. We produce and sell a wide array of cannabis products from our own cultivation and processing facilities, and continue to innovate to add to our product line in various states. Through investment in new equipment, brands and processes, we continue to introduce new products to sell to our retail and wholesale customers within our existing footprint in order to offer a wider array of choices to our customers as they build their baskets. 
 Acquire attractive targets to enhance our footprint, product offerings and/or operations. Strategic acquisitions are an important part of our ongoing growth strategy. We expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions that, among other things, are intended to increase revenue, build our geographic footprint, add new branded products to our portfolio and allow us to expand our capabilities and/or help improve operating efficiencies in existing markets. 
 Secure additional operating licenses throughout the United States. As more states legalize medical and/or adult-use cannabis products or expand their current cannabis regulations, new or additional cultivation, processing and/or dispensary licenses may become available. Given our operational history, we believe that we are well positioned to apply for any such new licenses.

In addition, we assumed certain debt instruments, warrants and options of MPX.

In addition, we acquired operations in Arizona, Nevada, Maryland and New Jersey and expanded our operations in Massachusetts. 
Citiva Medical, LLC 
 On February 1, 2018, we acquired Citiva which holds one vertically integrated medical cannabis license in the state of New York for fair market value consideration of $24.8 million (in cash and our common shares).

 GrowHealthy Properties, LLC 
 On January 17, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of GrowHealthy Holdings, LLC (including GrowHealthy Properties, LLC (“GHP”) and McCrory’s) for fair market value consideration of $58.3 million (in cash and our common shares).

 Mayflower Medicinals, Inc. and Pilgrim Rock Management, LLC 
 On December 31, 2017, we acquired an 80% interest in Pilgrim Rock Management, LLC (“Pilgrim”) and on April 17, 2018, we acquired the remaining 20% interest in Pilgrim for consideration of an aggregate of 1,665,734 of our common shares. Pilgrim is an affiliated management company that provides management services, financing, intellectual property licensing, real estate, equipment leasing and certain other services to Mayflower. On July 31, 2018, Mayflower converted from a non-profit into a for-profit corporation and became our wholly-owned subsidiary. As a result of the acquisitions of Mayflower and Pilgrim, we expanded our cannabis operations to Massachusetts. Mayflower maintains one final vertically integrated medical license, one provisional vertically integrated medical license, one final adult-use cultivation license, one final adult-use product manufacturing license and three final adult-use retail licenses. Mayflower’s final vertically integrated medical Marijuana Treatment Center license is comprised of a co-located cultivation and product manufacturing facility in Holliston, Massachusetts and a dispensary in Boston, Massachusetts. Mayflower’s adult-use operations include one adult-use Marijuana Establishment cultivation license and one adult-use Marijuana Establishment product manufacturing license, which are also co-located with Mayflower’s medical Marijuana Treatment Center cultivation and product manufacturing facility in Holliston, Massachusetts. 
Competition 
 We compete on a state-by-state basis in the limited license medical and adult-use cannabis markets as well as the national CBD markets. Participation in state cannabis programs has significant regulatory and financial hurdles that create high barriers to entry, which result in a limited number of market participants in most states. In addition, most of the states in which we operate impose regulatory limitations on the number of cannabis licenses that can be granted, thus allowing for existing license holders to compete against a fixed number of regulated competitors in a particular market. We face competition from local regulated cannabis operators as well as illicit cannabis businesses and other persons engaging in illicit cannabis-related activities within each state. Our primary competitors include the following multi-state operators: Acreage Holdings, Inc., Cresco Labs Inc., Curaleaf Holdings Inc., Green Thumb Industries Inc., Trulieve Cannabis Corp., AYR Wellness Inc. and Verano Holdings Corp. 
 
14 


 With respect to our CBD business, we compete with a growing number of emerging CBD companies including multi-state cannabis operators that also offer CBD products, as well as certain large national and multinational corporations that offer or plan to offer CBD products that are or may be deemed similar to those offered by us. 
 Financial Restructuring 
 The significant disruption of global financial markets, and specifically, the decline in the overall public equity cannabis markets due to the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic negatively impacted our ability to secure additional capital, which caused liquidity constraints. In early 2020, due to the liquidity constraints, we attempted to negotiate temporary relief of our interest obligations with the holders (the “Secured Lenders”) of our 13% senior secured convertible debentures (the “Secured Notes”) issued by ICM. However, we were unable to reach an agreement and did not make interest payments when due and payable to the Secured Lenders or payments that were due to the holders of our 8% convertible unsecured debentures (the “Unsecured Debentures” and together with the Secured Notes, the “Debentures”) (the “Unsecured Lenders” and together with the Secured Lenders, the “Lenders”). As a result, we defaulted on our obligations pursuant to the Secured Notes and the Unsecured Debentures. 
 On June 22, 2020, we received a notice demanding repayment under the Amended and Restated Debenture Purchase Agreement dated October 10, 2019 (the “Secured Notes Purchase Agreement”) of the entire principal amount of the Secured Notes, together with interest, fees, costs and other charges that have accrued or may accrue from Gotham Green Admin 1, LLC, the collateral agent (the “Collateral Agent”) holding security for the benefit of the Secured Notes. The Collateral Agent concurrently provided us with a Notice of Intention to Enforce Security under section 244 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada). 
 On July 10, 2020, we entered into a restructuring support agreement (as amended, the “Restructuring Support Agreement”) with the Secured Lenders and a majority of the Unsecured Lenders (the “Consenting Unsecured Lenders”) to effectuate a recapitalization transaction (the “Recapitalization Transaction”). Closing of the Recapitalization Transaction through an amended and restated plan of arrangement (the “Plan of Arrangement”) was subject to certain conditions, including: approval of the Secured Lenders, Unsecured Lenders and existing holders of our common shares, warrants, and options; approval of the Plan of Arrangement by the Supreme Court of British Columbia; and the receipt of all necessary state regulatory approvals in which we operate that require approval and approval by the CSE (collectively, the “Requisite Approvals”). All Requisite Approvals required to consummate the Recapitalization Transaction were satisfied, conditioned, or waived by us, the Secured Lenders and the Consenting Unsecured Lenders, and on June 24, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), we closed the Recapitalization Transaction pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) approved by the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Collateral Agent, the Secured Lenders and the Consenting Unsecured Lenders agreed to forbear from further exercising any rights or remedies in connection with any events of default that existed or may have existed in the future arise under any of the purchase agreements with respect to the Secured Notes and all other agreements delivered in connection therewith, the purchase agreements with respect to the Unsecured Debentures and all other agreements delivered in connection therewith and any other agreement to which the Collateral Agent, Secured Lenders, or Consenting Unsecured Lenders are a party to (collectively, the “Defaults”). As of the Closing Date, the Collateral Agent, Secured Lenders and Consenting Unsecured Lenders irrevocably waived all Defaults. In August 2021, Gotham Green Partners, LLC and the Collateral Agent filed a Notice of Application (with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, which sought, among other things, a declaration that the outside date for closing the Recapitalization Transaction be extended, which extension was granted by such court and we subsequently appealed. Following the closing of the Recapitalization Transaction, we discontinued the appeal with prejudice. 
 In connection with the closing of the Recapitalization Transaction, we issued an aggregate of 6,072,579,705 common shares to the Secured Lenders and Unsecured Lenders. Specifically, we issued 3,036,289,852 common shares (the “Secured Lender Shares”), or 48.625% of our outstanding common shares, to the Secured Lenders and 3,036,289,853 common shares (the “Unsecured Lender Shares” and together with Secured Lender Shares, the “Shares”), or 48.625% of our outstanding common shares, to the Unsecured Lenders. As of the Closing Date, we had 6,244,297,897 common shares issued and outstanding and existing holders of our common shares collectively held 171,718,192 common shares, or 2.75% of our outstanding common shares. 
 As of the Closing Date, the outstanding principal amount of the Secured Notes (including the interim financing secured notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $14.7 million originally due on July 13, 2025 (the “Interim Financing”)) together with interest accrued and fees thereon were forgiven in part and exchanged for (A) the Secured Lender Shares, (B) June Secured Debentures (as defined below) in the aggregate principal amount of $99,736,842 and (C) June Unsecured Debentures (as defined below) in the aggregate principal amount of $5 million. In addition, as of the Closing Date, the outstanding principal amount of the Unsecured Debentures together with interest accrued and fees thereon were forgiven in part and exchanged for (A) the Unsecured Lender Shares and (B) June Unsecured Debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $15 million. Furthermore, all existing options and warrants to purchase our common shares, including certain debenture warrants and exchange warrants previously issued to the Secured Lenders, the warrants previously issued in connection with the Unsecured Debentures and all other Affected Equity (as defined in the Plan of Arrangement), were cancelled and extinguished for no consideration. 
 Secured Debenture Purchase Agreement 
 In connection with the closing of the Recapitalization Transaction, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Secured Debenture Purchase Agreement (the “Secured DPA”), dated as of June 24, 2022, with ICM, the other Credit Parties (as defined in the Secured DPA), the Collateral Agent, and the lenders party thereto (the “New Secured Lenders”) pursuant to which ICM issued the New Secured Lenders 8% secured debentures (the “June Secured Debentures”) in the aggregate principal amount of $99,736,842 pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement. 
 
15 


 The June Secured Debentures accrue interest at a rate of 8% per annum (increasing to 11% upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the June Secured Debentures)), are due on June 24, 2027, and may be prepaid on a pro rata basis from and after the third anniversary of the Closing Date upon prior written notice to the New Secured Lenders without premium or penalty. Upon receipt of a Change of Control Notice (as defined in the June Secured Debentures), each New Secured Lender may provide notice to ICM to either (i) purchase the June Secured Debenture at a price equal to 103% of the then outstanding principal amount together with interest accrued thereon (the “Offer Price”) or (ii) if the Change of Control Transaction (as defined in Secured DPA) results in a new issuer, or if the New Secured Lender desires that the June Secured Debenture remain unpaid and continue in effect after the closing of the Change of Control Transaction, convert or exchange the June Secured Debenture into a replacement debenture of the new issuer or ICM, as applicable, in the aggregate principal amount of the Offer Price on substantially equivalent terms to those terms contained in the June Secured Debenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if 90% or more of the principal amount of all June Secured Debentures outstanding have been tendered for redemption on the date of the Change of Control Notice, ICM may, at its sole discretion, redeem all of the outstanding June Secured Debentures at the Offer Price. As security for the Obligations (as defined in the June Secured Debenture), ICM and the Company granted to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the New Secured Lenders, a security interest over all of their present and after acquired personal property. 
 Pursuant to the Secured DPA, so long as Gotham Green Partners, LLC or any of its Affiliates (as defined in the Secured DPA) hold at least 50% of the outstanding principal amount of June Secured Debentures, the Collateral Agent will have the right to appoint two non-voting observers to our board of directors (the “Board of Directors” or the “Board”), each of which shall receive up to a maximum amount of $25,000 in any 12-month period for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, pursuant to the Secured DPA, the New Secured Lenders purchased an additional $25,000,000 of June Secured Debentures (the “Additional Secured Debentures”). 
 Unsecured Debenture Agreement 
 In connection with the closing of the Recapitalization Transaction, we, as guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations (as defined in the Unsecured DPA (as defined herein)), entered into an Unsecured Debenture Agreement (the “Unsecured DPA”) dated as of June 24, 2022 with ICM, the Secured Lenders and the Consenting Unsecured Lenders pursuant to which ICM issued 8% unsecured debentures (the “June Unsecured Debentures”) in the aggregate principal amount of $20 million pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, including $5 million to the Secured Lenders and $15 million to the Unsecured Lenders. 
 The June Unsecured Debentures accrue interest at a rate of 8% per annum (increasing to 11% upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the June Unsecured Debentures)), are due on June 24, 2027, and may be prepaid on a pro rata basis from and after the third anniversary of the Closing Date upon prior written notice to the Unsecured Lender without premium or penalty. Upon receipt of a Change of Control Notice (as defined in the June Unsecured Debenture), each Unsecured Lender may provide notice to ICM to either (i) purchase the June Unsecured Debenture at a price equal to 103% of the then outstanding principal amount together with interest accrued thereon (the “Unsecured Offer Price”) or (ii) if the Change of Control Transaction (as defined in Unsecured DPA) results in a new issuer, or if the Unsecured Lender desires that the June Unsecured Debenture remain unpaid and continue in effect after the closing of the Change of Control Transaction, convert or exchange the June Unsecured Debenture into a replacement debenture of the new issuer or ICM, as applicable, in the aggregate principal amount of the Unsecured Offer Price on substantially equivalent terms to those terms contained in the June Unsecured Debenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if 90% or more of the principal amount of all June Unsecured Debentures outstanding have been tendered for redemption on the date of the Change of Control Notice, ICM may, at its sole discretion, redeem all of the outstanding June Unsecured Debentures at the Unsecured Offer Price. Pursuant to the Unsecured DPA, the Obligations (as defined in the Unsecured DPA) are subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Indebtedness (as defined in the Unsecured DPA). 
 Pursuant to the Recapitalization Transaction, the Secured Lenders, the Unsecured Lenders and our shareholders were allocated and issued the June Secured Debentures, the June Unsecured Debentures, and percentage of our pro forma common shares, as presented in the following table: 
 

(in ’000s of U.S. dollars) | June SecuredDebentures(1) | | InterimFinancing(2) | | | June UnsecuredDebentures(3) | | ProFormaCommonEquity(4)
Secured Lenders | $ | 85,000 | | $ | 14,737 | | $ | 5,000 | 48.625 | %

(4) | On December 31, 2021, our Board of Directors approved the terms of a Long-Term Incentive Program recommended by our compensation committee, pursuant to which, on July 26, 2022, we issued to certain of our employees (including executive officers) an aggregate of 320,165,409 restricted stock units (“RSUs”), under our Amended and Restated Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Incentive Plan”) dated October 15, 2018 in order to attract and retain such employees. RSUs represent a right to receive a single common share that is both non-transferable and forfeitable until certain conditions are satisfied. The allocation of RSUs was contingent upon the closing of the Recapitalization Transaction and was subject to approval of the Canadian Securities Exchange and the Board. All of our existing warrants and options were cancelled, and our common shares may be consolidated pursuant to a consolidation ratio which has yet to be determined.

Registration Rights Agreement 
 In connection with the consummation of the Recapitalization Transaction, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the “RRA”) dated as of the Closing Date with ICM and certain holders of Registrable Securities (as defined in the RRA) (the “Holders”) pursuant to which we shall, upon receipt of written notice (the “Shelf Request”) from Holders of at least 15% of our outstanding common shares (the “Substantial Holders”), prepare and file (i) with the applicable Canadian Securities Regulators (as defined in the RRA), a Shelf Prospectus (as defined in the RRA) to facilitate a secondary offering of all of the Registrable Securities or (ii) with the SEC, a registration statement on Form S-3 (the “S-3 Registration Statement”) covering the resale of all Registrable Securities. Pursuant to the RRA, subject to certain exceptions, we shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file the Shelf Prospectus or the S-3 Registration Statement, as applicable, as soon as practicable but in no event later than 20 days following the receipt of the Shelf Request. In addition, pursuant to the RRA, the Substantial Holders may request (the “Demand Registration Request”) that we file a Prospectus (as defined in the RRA) (other than a Shelf Prospectus) or a registration statement on any form that we are then eligible to use (the “Registration Statement”) to facilitate a Distribution (as defined in the RRA) in Canada or the United States of all or any portion of the Registrable Securities (the “Demand Registration”) held by the Holders requesting the Demand Registration. 
 Pursuant to the RRA, subject to certain exceptions, we shall use our commercially reasonable efforts to file one or more Prospectuses or Registration Statements within 20 days following delivery of a Demand Registration Request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we shall not be obligated to effect more than two Demand Registrations in any fiscal year. Moreover, pursuant to the RRA and subject to certain exceptions, if, at any time, we propose to make a Distribution for our own account, we shall notify the Holders of such Distribution (the “Piggyback Registration”) and shall use reasonable commercial efforts to include in the Piggyback Registration such Registrable Securities requested by the Holders be included in such Piggyback Registration. Furthermore, pursuant to the RRA and subject to certain exceptions, after the receipt by us of a Demand Registration Request, we shall not, among other things, without the prior written consent of Holders of least 66 2/3% of the then issued common shares held by all Holders (the “Requisite Holders”) authorize, issue or sell any common shares or Equity Securities (as defined in the RRA) until the date which is 90 days after the later of (i) the date on which a receipt is issued for the Prospectus or Registration Statement filed in connection with such Demand Registration and (ii) the completion of the offering contemplated by the Demand Registration, provided that in respect of any subsequent Demand Registration Request in any fiscal year, such date shall be reduced to the date which is 30 days after the later of (i) and (ii) above. Moreover, pursuant to the RRA and subject to certain exceptions, we shall not grant registration rights to any other Person (as defined in the RRA) without the prior written consent of the Requisite Holders. In addition, we shall use our best efforts to cause a Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as possible but in no event later than the date which is 30 days (or 90 days if the SEC notifies us that it will “review” the Registration Statement) after the initial filing of such Registration Statement. 
 New Board of Directors 
 Effective as of the Closing Date, each of Michael Muldowney, Diane Ellis and Robert Galvin resigned from our Board of Directors as well as our audit committee, our nominating and corporate governance committee and our compensation committee, as applicable. Pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Arrangement and the IRA (as defined herein), the Secured Lenders have the right to nominate three directors to our Board and the Consenting Unsecured Lenders have the right to collectively nominate three directors to our Board. Specifically, we entered into an Investor Rights Agreement (“IRA”) dated June 24, 2022 with ICM and certain investors (the “Investors”) in connection with the closing of the Recapitalization Transaction pursuant to which the Investors are entitled to designate nominees for election or appointment to our Board as follows:

 Recent Developments 
 Issuance of common shares 
 On January 5, 2023, we issued 7,853 common shares for vested RSUs. We withheld 7,776 common shares to satisfy our employees’ tax obligations of $0.2 million. 
 On March 3, 2023, we issued 27,930 common shares for vested RSUs to Mr. Kalcevich as per the December Separation Agreement. 
 Extension of INJ Senior Secured Bridge Notes 
 On February 2, 2023, we entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the $11.0 million senior secured bridge notes issued by INJ on February 2, 2021 (“Senior Secured Bridge Notes”) with all the holders of such notes. Pursuant to the Amendment, the maturity date of the Senior Secured Bridge Notes was extended until February 2, 2024, the interest on the principal amount outstanding was increased to a rate of 12% per annum, and an amendment fee equal to 10% of the principal amount outstanding of the Senior Secured Bridge Notes as of February 2, 2023 or $1.4 million in the aggregate, was added to such notes such that it will become due and payable on the maturity date. 
Disposition of Vermont Operations 
 On February 6, 2023, ICM entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “MIPA”) with an unaffiliated third-party buyer (the “VT Buyer”) for the sale of all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of GVMS (the “GVMS Sale”) for $0.2 million, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the MIPA. The closing of the MIPA remains subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the Vermont Cannabis Control Board (the “CCB”). On February 6, 2023, ICM, GVMS and GRVT entered into a management agreement (the “Management Agreement”) with the VT Buyer, which went into effect on March 8, 2023. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the VT Buyer will manage the operations of GRVT until the closing of the GVMS Sale. The Management Agreement terminates upon the earlier of the closing of the GVMS Sale or termination of the MIPA. 
Intellectual Property 
 Our portfolio of subsidiaries currently includes a number of local and multi-state brands. As cannabis currently remains illegal under U.S. federal law, we cannot register our cannabis brands with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. However, we rely on the intellectual property protections afforded under applicable state laws and common law through the use of our marks in commerce in each of the respective regions in which we operate. 
Governmental Regulations 
 Cannabis 
 In the United States, the cultivation, manufacturing, importation, distribution, use and possession of cannabis is illegal under U.S. federal law. However, medical and adult-use cannabis has been legalized and regulated by individual states. Pursuant to the Congressional Research Service, as of March 1, 2023, (i) 37 states plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have comprehensive laws and policies allowing for the medicinal use of marijuana, (ii) 10 additional states allow for “limited access medical cannabis,” which refers to low-THC cannabis or CBD oil and (iii) 21 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands have enacted laws allowing the recreational use of marijuana. Notwithstanding the regulatory environment with respect to cannabis at the state level, cannabis continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA. Accordingly, the use, possession, or distribution of cannabis violates U.S. federal law. As a result, cannabis businesses in the United States are subject to inconsistent state and federal legislation, regulation and enforcement. 
 Under former President Barack Obama, in an effort to provide guidance to U.S. federal law enforcement regarding the inconsistent regulation of cannabis at the U.S. federal and state levels, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) released a memorandum on August 29, 2013 titled “Guidance Regarding Marijuana Enforcement” from former Deputy Attorney General James Cole (the “Cole Memorandum”). The Cole Memorandum acknowledged that, although cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA, the U.S. Attorneys in states that have legalized cannabis should prioritize the use of the U.S. federal government’s limited prosecutorial resources by focusing enforcement actions on the following eight areas of concern (the “Cole Priorities”): 
 
18 


 
• | Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing marijuana possession or use on U.S. federal property.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 In January 2018, under the administration of former President Donald Trump, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum. While this did not create a change in U.S. federal law, as the Cole Memorandum was policy guidance and not law, the rescission added to the uncertainty of U.S. federal enforcement of the CSA in states where cannabis use is legal and regulated. Former Attorney General Sessions, concurrent with the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, issued a memorandum (“Sessions Memorandum”) which explained that the Cole Memorandum was “unnecessary” due to existing general enforcement guidance adopted in the 1980s, as set forth in the U.S. Attorney’s Manual (“USAM”). The USAM enforcement priorities, like those of the Cole Memorandum, are also based on the U.S. federal government’s limited resources and include law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the alleged crimes, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. 
 While the Sessions Memorandum emphasizes that cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA and states that it is a “dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime,” it does not otherwise provide that the prosecution of cannabis-related offenses is now a DOJ priority. Furthermore, the Sessions Memorandum explicitly indicates that it is a guide for prosecutorial discretion and that discretion is firmly in the hands of U.S. Attorneys who determine whether to prosecute cannabis-related offenses. U.S. Attorneys could individually continue to exercise their discretion in a manner similar to that permitted under the Cole Memorandum. While certain U.S. Attorneys have publicly affirmed their commitment to proceeding in a manner contemplated under the Cole Memorandum, or otherwise affirmed that their views of U.S. federal enforcement priorities have not changed as a result of the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, others have publicly supported the rescission of the Cole Memorandum. 
 Under former Attorney General William Barr, the Department of Justice did not take a formal position on the federal enforcement of laws relating to cannabis. However, prior to his resignation on December 23, 2020, former Attorney General William Barr stated that his preference would be to have a uniform federal rule against cannabis, but, absent such a uniform rule, his preference would be to permit the existing federal approach leaving it up to the states to make their own decision. In addition, former Attorney General William Barr indicated that the DOJ was reviewing the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act (“STATES Act”), which would shield individuals and businesses complying with state cannabis laws from federal intervention. 
 On March 10, 2021, the Senate confirmed, President Joseph R. Biden’s nominee, Merrick Garland, to serve as Attorney General in his administration. Furthermore, two of President Biden’s nominees for top positions at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) have strong track records of supporting and defending state-legalized marijuana programs. California’s former Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who serves as the head of HHS, vowed to defend California’s legal cannabis market from any potential intervention during the Trump administration. In addition, Pennsylvania’s former Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine, who serves as the Assistant Secretary of HHS, played a pivotal role in the implementation of Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana program. On October 6, 2022, President Joseph Biden announced a three-step program to bring broad changes to federal marijuana policy. As an initial step towards reform, President Biden began the process of pardoning all federal offenders convicted of simple marijuana possession. As a second step, President Biden encouraged Governors to take similar steps to pardon simple state marijuana possession charges. Finally, President Biden directed the Department of Health and Human Services and Attorney General Merrick Garland to “expeditiously” review marijuana’s status as a Schedule I controlled drug under the CSA. Despite the growing enthusiasm in the cannabis business community, it remains unclear whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Garland will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum or effectuate a substantive marijuana enforcement policy change. 
 Other federal legislation provides or seeks to provide protection to individuals and businesses acting in violation of U.S. federal law but in compliance with state cannabis laws. For example, the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment has been included in annual spending bills passed by Congress since 2014. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment restricts the DOJ from using federal funds to interfere with states implementing laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical cannabis. 
 
19 


 U.S. courts have construed these appropriations bills to prevent the U.S. federal government from prosecuting individuals or businesses engaged in cannabis-related activities to the extent they are operating in compliance with state medical cannabis laws. However, because this conduct continues to violate U.S. federal law, U.S. courts have observed that should the U.S. Congress choose to appropriate funds to prosecute individuals or businesses acting in violation of the CSA, such individuals or businesses could be prosecuted for violations of U.S. federal law even to the extent/even if they are operating in compliance with applicable state medical cannabis laws. 
 If Congress declines to include the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment in future fiscal year appropriations bills or fails to pass necessary budget legislation causing a government shutdown, the U.S. federal government will have the authority to spend federal funds to prosecute individuals and businesses acting contrary to the CSA for violations of U.S. federal law. 
 Furthermore, the appropriations protections only apply to individuals and businesses operating in compliance with a state’s medical cannabis laws and provide no protection to individuals or businesses operating in compliance with a state’s adult-use cannabis laws. 
 Additionally, there are a number of marijuana reform bills that have been introduced in the U.S. Congress that would amend federal law regarding the legal status and permissibility of medical and adult-use cannabis, including the STATES Act, the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (the “MORE Act”) and the Substance Regulation and Safety Act (the “SRSA”). The STATES Act would create an exemption in the CSA to allow states to determine their own cannabis policies without fear of federal reprisal. The MORE Act, which was reintroduced to the House of Representatives on May 28, 2021, would remove cannabis from the CSA, expunge federal cannabis offenses and establish a 5% excise tax on cannabis to fund various federal grant programs. The SRSA, which was introduced by U.S. Senator Tina Smith on July 30, 2020, would remove cannabis from the CSA, grant the FDA authority to regulate cannabis and cannabis products and regulate the safety and quality control of cannabis crops and the import and export of cannabis materials. In addition to the foregoing, on December 2, 2022, President Biden signed the Medical Marijuana Research Act (the “MMRA”) into law. The MMRA is a piece of bipartisan legislation and marks the first standalone cannabis reform bill to be signed into law, a significant milestone in the evolution of federal cannabis policy. While the new law does not change marijuana’s status as a Schedule I substance under the CSA, the legislation is intended to: 1) advance research on the potential risks and medical benefits of cannabis, cannabis products, and their synthetic equivalents by streamlining and clarifying the role of the DEA in research; 2) expand sources of research-grade marijuana; 3) promote the commercial development of FDA-approved drugs derived from marijuana and CBD; and 4) ensure that physicians may discuss the potential risks and benefits of marijuana and CBD with their patients. At this time, it is uncertain which other federal marijuana reform bills, if any, will ultimately be passed and signed into law. 
 Businesses in the regulated cannabis industry, including our business, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States that involve money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crime, including the U.S. Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (“Bank Secrecy Act”) and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (the “US PATRIOT Act”) and the rules and regulations thereunder and any related or similar rules, regulations, or guidelines, issued, administered, or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States. Further, under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be charged with money laundering, aiding and abetting, or conspiracy. 
 Despite these laws, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), a bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“U.S. Treasury”), issued a memorandum on February 14, 2014 (the “FinCEN Memorandum”), which provides instructions to banks and other financial institutions seeking to provide services to cannabis-related businesses. The FinCEN Memorandum explicitly references the Cole Priorities and indicates that in some circumstances it is permissible for banks and other financial institutions to provide services to cannabis-related businesses without risking prosecution for violation of U.S. federal money laundering laws. Under these guidelines, financial institutions are subject to a requirement to submit a suspicious activity report in certain circumstances as required by federal money laundering laws. These cannabis related suspicious activity reports are divided into three categories: marijuana limited, marijuana priority and marijuana terminated, based on the financial institution’s belief that the marijuana business follows state law, is operating out of compliance with state law, or where the banking relationship has been terminated, respectively. The FinCEN Memorandum refers to supplementary guidance in the Cole Memorandum relating to the prosecution of money laundering offenses predicated on cannabis-related violations of the CSA. 
 The rescission of the Cole Memorandum did not affect the status of the FinCEN Memorandum, and to date, the U.S. Treasury has not given any indication that it intends to rescind the FinCEN Memorandum. While the FinCEN Memorandum was originally intended to work in tandem with the Cole Memorandum, the FinCEN Memorandum appears to remain in effect as standalone guidance. Although the FinCEN Memorandum remains intact, indicating that the U.S. Treasury and FinCEN intend to continue abiding by its guidance, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will continue to follow the guidelines set forth under the FinCEN Memorandum.

 In March 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act (the “SAFE Banking Act”) which creates protections for financial institutions that provide banking services to businesses acting in compliance with applicable state cannabis laws. Most recently, on July 19, 2021, the America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing, Pre-Eminence in Technology, and Economic Strength Act of 2022 (the “America COMPETES Act of 2022”) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. The America COMPETES Act of 2022 includes provisions of the SAFE Banking Act and sets out financial regulations for cannabis-related businesses and revises other aspects of the financial system with regard to cannabis-related businesses. On February 4, 2022, a majority of the U.S. House of Representatives passed the America COMPETES Act of 2022; however, it did not pass the U.S. Senate. The SAFE Banking Act was again introduced in the House and passed as an amendment to the FY 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, but the amendment did not pass in the Senate at the close of the 2022 congressional session. This marked the seventh time that the U.S. House of Representatives have advanced SAFE Banking to the U.S. Senate. 
 There can be no assurance that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. In addition, local and city ordinances may strictly limit and/or restrict the distribution of cannabis in a manner that could make it difficult or impossible to operate cannabis businesses in certain jurisdictions. 
 Hemp 
 On December 20, 2018, the U.S. Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the “2018 Farm Bill”) was signed into law. Prior to its enactment, the U.S. federal government did not distinguish between cannabis and hemp and the entire plant species Cannabis sativa L. (subject to narrow exceptions applicable to specific portions of the plant) was scheduled as a controlled substance under the CSA. Therefore, the cultivation of hemp for any purpose in the United States without a Schedule I registration with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) was federally illegal, unless exempted by Section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (the “2014 Farm Bill”). The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp (which is defined as “the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis”) and its derivatives, extracts and cannabinoids, including CBD derived from hemp, from the definition of marijuana in the CSA, thereby removing hemp and its derivatives from DEA purview as a controlled substance. The 2018 Farm Bill also amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to allow for the commercial production of hemp in the United States under the purview of the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”) in coordination with state departments of agriculture that elect to have primary regulatory authority over hemp production in their respective jurisdictions. Pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill, states, U.S. territories and tribal governments may adopt their own regulatory plans for hemp production even if more restrictive than federal regulations so long as they meet minimum federal standards and are approved by the USDA. Hemp production in states and tribal territories that do not choose to submit their own plans and that do not prohibit hemp production will be governed by USDA regulations. 
 On October 31, 2019, the USDA issued an interim final rule governing the domestic production of hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill, establishing the U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program (the “USDA IFR”). The USDA IFR outlines the requirements for the USDA to approve plans submitted by states and tribal governments for the domestic production of hemp. It also establishes a federal plan for hemp producers in states or territories of Native American tribes that do not have USDA-approved hemp production plans. Pursuant to the USDA IFR, the USDA reviews hemp production plans submitted by state and tribal governments that wish to obtain or retain primary regulatory authority over hemp production in their respective jurisdictions. Once the USDA formally receives a plan from a state or tribal government, the agency has 60 days to review and approve or reject the plan. 
 Although the USDA IFR provides the framework for the USDA, state departments of agriculture and tribal governments to begin the implementation of commercial hemp production programs pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill, the 2014 Farm Bill was scheduled to remain in effect for one year after the effective date of the USDA IFR. On January 15, 2021, the USDA issued a final rule on hemp production which incorporates modifications established under the USDA IFR published in October 2019. The rule became effective on March 22, 2021 and outlines, among other things, the licensing requirements, recordkeeping requirements, procedures for testing THC concentrations and, procedures for disposing of non-compliant plants. 
 The application of the hemp provisions of the 2014 Farm Bill was initially set to expire on October 31, 2020, at which time state programs would be required to comply with the 2018 Farm Bill regulations. However, U.S. Senators and state agricultural departments requested an extension of the application of the 2014 Farm Bill and a delay of the implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill due to delays caused by COVID-19. Although, as a result of the extension, the 2014 Farm Bill was set to expire on December 31, 2021, it was extended until January 1, 2022, by the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2021. As of January 1, 2022, there have been no further extensions and all states must either have a USDA-approved hemp product plan, or grant regulatory oversight over hemp cultivation to the USDA. 
 Under the 2018 Farm Bill, states and tribal governments have authority to adopt regulatory regimes that are more restrictive than federal mandates or prohibit hemp production altogether. Accordingly, variance in hemp regulation across jurisdictions is likely to persist. Compliance with state hemp law, if any, is required under the 2018 Farm Bill. 
 As a result of the 2018 Farm Bill, federal law now provides that CBD derived from hemp is not a controlled substance under the CSA; however, CBD derived from hemp could still be considered a controlled substance under applicable state law. States take varying approaches to regulating the production and sale of hemp and hemp-derived CBD. While some states explicitly authorize and regulate 
 
21 


 the production and sale of CBD or otherwise provide legal protection for authorized individuals and businesses to engage in commercial hemp activities, other states maintain outdated drug laws that do not distinguish hemp or hemp-derived CBD from marijuana (or “cannabis” as used herein), resulting in hemp being classified as a controlled substance under certain state laws. In these states, the sale of CBD, notwithstanding its origin, is either restricted to state medical or adult-use cannabis program licensees or remains unlawful. Additionally, a number of states prohibit the sale of consumable CBD products based on the position of the FDA set forth in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FFDCA”) that it is unlawful to introduce food containing added CBD or THC into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products as or in dietary supplements regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. 
 The 2018 Farm Bill preserves the authority and jurisdiction of the FDA under the FFDCA to regulate the manufacture, marketing and sale of food, drugs, dietary supplements and cosmetics, including products that contain hemp extracts and derivatives such as CBD. As a producer and marketer of hemp-derived products, we are required to comply with FDA regulations applicable to the manufacturing and marketing of such products, including with respect to dietary supplements, food and cosmetics. To date, the FDA has not deemed CBD or other cannabinoids permissible for use in dietary supplements, as dietary ingredients, or as safe for use in food. The FDA has consistently taken the position that CBD is prohibited from being marketed as a dietary supplement or added to food because substantial clinical trials studying CBD as a new drug must be made public prior to the marketing of any food or dietary supplements containing CBD. 
 The FDA has issued warning letters to companies unlawfully marketing CBD products. In many of these cases, the manufacturer made unsubstantiated claims that products containing CBD are able to treat serious medical conditions, including cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, opioid withdrawal and anxiety, among others, without obtaining drug approvals. Some of these letters were co-signed with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and cited the companies for making claims about the efficacy of CBD that were not substantiated by scientific evidence. 
 The FDA has stated that it recognizes the potential opportunities and significant interest in drugs and consumer products containing CBD, is committed to evaluating the agency’s regulatory policies related to CBD and has established a high-level internal working group to explore potential pathways for various types of CBD products to be lawfully marketed. The FDA has authority to issue regulation that would allow these naturally-occurring hemp compounds to be added to food or dietary supplements. In May 2019, the FDA held a public hearing to obtain scientific data and information about the safety, manufacturing, product quality, marketing, labeling and sale of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than Epidiolex (cannabidiol), a cannabis-derived product, and three synthetic cannabis-related drug products (Marinol (dronabinol), Syndros (dronabinol) and Cesamet (nabilone)), the FDA has not approved a marketing application for cannabis for the treatment of any disease or condition and has not approved any cannabis, cannabis-derived or CBD products. See Risk Factors—Our products are not approved by the FDA or any other federal governmental authority; and There is uncertainty surrounding the regulatory pathway for CBD. 
 In connection with the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, the House Committee on Appropriations issued an explanatory statement agreeing to appropriate $2.0 million in funding to the FDA for research, policy evaluation, market surveillance and issuance of an enforcement discretion policy for products under the FDA’s jurisdiction that contain CBD. The legislation required the FDA to provide a report within 60 days regarding its progress in obtaining and analyzing data to help determine a policy of enforcement discretion and the process through which CBD will be evaluated for use in products. On March 5, 2020, the FDA issued a report on its progress and committed to expanding its educational efforts regarding CBD products, encouraging, facilitating and initiating more research on CBD, continuing to monitor the CBD marketplace and take appropriate action against unlawful CBD products that pose a risk of harm to the public and developing a risk-based enforcement policy aimed at protecting the public and providing more regulatory clarity regarding the FDA’s CBD enforcement priorities. The FDA was also required to conduct a sampling study of the current CBD marketplace to determine the extent to which products containing CBD are mislabeled or adulterated within 180 days of the enactment of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020. 
 On July 9, 2020, the FDA issued its sampling study to the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations and the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations detailing the sampling conducted in recent years on CBD products. While the minority of CBD products previously tested by the FDA contained CBD concentrations consistent with their labeling, the report states that a majority of products tested for potentially harmful elements “did not raise significant public health concerns.” The report further provides that the FDA will undertake a more extensive sampling effort expected to cover a representative sample of currently marketed CBD products, including tinctures, oils, extracts, capsules, powders, gummies, water and other beverages, conventional foods, cosmetics, lubricants, tampons, suppositories, vape cartridges and products sold for consumption by pets. Products will be evaluated for cannabinoid content as well as potentially harmful elements. 
 The rules, regulations and enforcement in this area continue to evolve and develop. On August 20, 2020, the DEA issued an interim final rule conforming its regulations to the 2018 Farm Bill (the “DEA IFR”), which went into effect on August 21, 2020. Notably, the DEA IFR creates uncertainty with respect to the federal legal status of any hemp derivative, extract, or product that exceeds a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of 0.3 percent during processing, which, pursuant to the DEA IFR, renders it a federal Schedule I substance under the CSA even if the hemp plant from which any such material is sourced does not exceed the 0.3 percent threshold.

 On September 4, 2020, the Hemp and Hemp-Derived CBD Consumer Protection and Market Stabilization Act of 2020 was initially introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives and was reintroduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on February 4, 2021. The Hemp and Hemp-Derived CBD Consumer Protection and Market Stabilization Act of 2020 permits the inclusion of hemp and CBD derived from hemp as ingredients in dietary supplements that otherwise comply with the applicable requirements for dietary supplements set forth in the FFDCA and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. The bill does not address the inclusion of hemp or CBD derived from hemp as ingredients in food products, and it is unclear whether it will ultimately be passed and signed into law. 
 On January 8, 2021, the FDA issued a report stating that more real-world data on CBD use and safety, alongside data from other types of studies, is needed to fill in the current gaps in the FDA’s understanding of the safety profile of CBD and many other cannabis-derived compounds, including potential safety risks for people and animals. Until these gaps are filled and the FDA formally adopts regulations authorizing the production and sale of CBD products as food and/or dietary supplements, there is a risk that the FDA could take enforcement action against us. Failure to comply with FDA requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, seizures, fines and criminal prosecutions. We continue to closely monitor FDA developments with respect to CBD and our compliance with applicable United States laws relating to hemp, including the FDA’s regulations of CBD and evaluate and implement appropriate compliance measures on an ongoing basis. 
 On February 8, 2022, the Hemp Advancement Act of 2022 was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Hemp Advancement Act of 2022 would raise the permitted THC threshold for hemp and in-process hemp extract, remove the requirement that hemp testing occur at DEA-registered facilities, and allow people with drug-related felony convictions to receive a hemp license. The 2018 Farm Bill is set to expire in September 2023. Congress is currently considering a number of reforms to protect public safety and benefit the hemp industry for inclusion in the next iteration of the Farm Bill. Such provisions may seek to address requirements such as DEA-registered testing labs, short testing windows, background checks for hemp growers, and the low THC limit for hemp. Lawmakers are also considering inclusion of provisions from the Hemp Advancement Act into the next Farm Bill. 
 Application of Cannabis Regulations in the United States 
 Violations of U.S. federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions, or settlements arising from either civil or criminal proceedings brought by either the U.S. federal government or private citizens, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, seizure of property or products, cessation of business activities, or divestiture. Our cannabis business activities and the cannabis business activities of our subsidiaries, while believed to be compliant with applicable U.S. state and local laws, currently are illegal under U.S. federal law.
