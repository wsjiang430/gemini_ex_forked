Our innovative, award-winning products, combined with our customer-first approach, allow us to attract customers worldwide. Kodak is committed to environmental stewardship, including industry leadership in developing sustainable solutions for print.
 
The Company was founded by George Eastman in 1880 and incorporated in 1901 in the State of New Jersey.  Kodak is headquartered in Rochester, New York.
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS
 Kodak’s operations are classified into four reportable segments: Traditional Printing, Digital Printing, Advanced Materials and Chemicals and Brand. The balance of Kodak’s continuing operations, which do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment, are reported in All Other and primarily represent the Eastman Business Park ("EBP") operations.
Traditional Printing 
 The Traditional Printing segment is comprised of Prepress Solutions, which includes Kodak’s digital offset plate offerings and computer-to-plate (“CTP”) imaging solutions. The Traditional Printing segment provides digital and traditional product and service offerings to a variety of commercial industries, including commercial print, direct mail, book publishing, newspapers and magazines and packaging.
 
This segment is experiencing challenges from higher raw material and other supply chain costs, digital substitution and competitive pricing pressures. Refer to the Business Overview and Strategy section of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” for additional information on the opportunities and challenges related to Traditional Printing.
 
The goal of Prepress Solutions is to pursue a contract-based, stable and recurring cash flow-generative business model. The average duration of customer contracts is two years. These contracts generate recurring revenue. The core of the business is the manufacturing of aluminum digital printing plates of varying sizes. These plates can be as small as 23cm x 27cm and as large as 126cm x 287cm. Unexposed plates are sold to commercial printing companies for use in the offset printing process. Kodak also manufactures equipment, known as CTP equipment, which images the plates with a laser. The plates are used in the offset printing process, which transfers ink from the plate onto a rubber blanket and then onto the substrate to be printed. Due to the nature of the imaging and printing process, a new plate must be used for each printing run. As a result, there is a recurring revenue stream from the sale of these plates.
 
The Traditional Printing products and services are sold globally to customers through both a direct sales team as well as indirectly through dealers and channel partners.
 
Kodak’s primary competitors are Fuji and Agfa. Kodak expects to benefit from current industry trends, including customers’ increasing focus on sustainability initiatives, which may strengthen demand for Kodak’s process-free solutions.
 
Digital offset plate offerings include KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates. Instead of the traditional process in which a plate is run through processing equipment containing a solution of developer, chemicals and water to set the image, KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates enable printers to set the image on the platesetter, then go directly to press. There’s also no processing variability, so process-free plate users benefit from more consistent and stable plates.  It’s designed to be a much more environmentally friendly approach that could eliminate all processing chemicals, water and excess energy and waste from the plate-making process. These plates are designed to deliver cost savings and efficiency for customers and promote environmental sustainability practices.

Net sales for Traditional Printing accounted for 59%, 57% and 58% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
The Traditional Printing segment also provides service and support related to these products.
 
On September 1, 2019 Kodak established a strategic relationship with Lucky HuaGuang Graphics Co. Ltd (“HuaGuang”) in the People’s Republic of China. The relationship is comprised of an agreement under which Kodak sold its shares of the Kodak (China) Graphic Communication Co. Ltd. entity, which included the offset printing plates facility in Xiamen, China, and related assets and liabilities, to HuaGuang; a supply agreement for HuaGuang to help Kodak fulfill customer demand; and a license agreement under which Kodak licensed its plates technology, including its Sonora Process Free plates technology, to HuaGuang with the intent of expanding the plates market in China.  As part of the arrangement, Kodak established an escrow in China to secure minimum payments required under the supply agreement. The escrow balance as of December 31, 2022 approximated $5 million.
 
Digital Printing 
 The Digital Printing segment contains PROSPER, Software, Electrophotographic Printing Solutions and Versamark.  Digital Printing products include high-quality digital printing solutions using electrically charged toner-based technology, production press systems, consumables (primarily ink), inkjet components, software and services. Digital Printing products are distributed directly by Kodak and indirectly through dealers. The markets that the Digital Printing segment serves are highly competitive in variable printing applications like direct mail, newspapers, books, and packaging/labels. Key competitors are HP, Canon, Ricoh and Screen. Products and services included in Kodak’s offerings are described below.

RAW MATERIALS
 The raw materials used by Kodak are many and varied and are generally readily available. Lithographic aluminum is the primary material used in the manufacture of offset printing plates.  Kodak procures lithographic aluminum coils from several suppliers with pricing based on prevailing market prices for aluminum. Lithographic aluminum is experiencing significantly increased prices and demand. Electronic components are used in the manufacturing of commercial printers and other electronic devices. The film and chemicals business uses many raw materials, including silver, from a broad range of suppliers. While most raw materials are generally available from multiple sources, certain key electronic components, other components and specialty chemicals included in the finished goods manufactured by Kodak and manufactured by and purchased from Kodak’s third-party suppliers are obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects Kodak to supply risks. Refer to the Executive Overview section of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” for a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global events for additional information.
SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS
 Printing equipment and plate unit sales generally are higher in the fourth quarter, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices and buying patterns.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 Kodak's general practice is to protect its investment in research and development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents. The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's ability to provide industry-leading products. Kodak holds portfolios of patents in several areas important to its business, including specific technologies such as lithographic printing plates and related equipment systems; digital printing workflow and color management proofing systems; color and black-and-white electrophotographic printing systems including key press components and toners; commercial inkjet writing systems and components, presses and inks; custom and specialty materials for 3D printing, functional printing materials, material formulations, and deposition modalities; engineered microparticles for specific functions; security materials; and embedded information. Each of these areas is important to existing and emerging business opportunities that bear directly on Kodak's overall business performance.
 
In addition to patents, Kodak’s intellectual property includes know-how in many of the areas noted above, but in other businesses as well, such as color negative films, processing and print films and manufacturing of KSMs for the pharmaceutical industry.
 
Kodak's major products are not dependent upon one single, material patent. Rather, the technologies that underlie Kodak's products are supported by an aggregation of patents having various remaining lives and expiration dates. There is no individual patent, or group of patents, whose expiration is expected to have a material impact on Kodak's results of operations.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 Kodak is subject to a wide variety of increasingly stringent federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. It is Kodak’s policy to carry out its business activities in a manner consistent with sound health, safety and environmental management practices, and to comply with applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations. Kodak continues to engage in programs for environmental, health and safety protection and control.
 
A liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to Kodak’s operations, cash flows or financial position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on operations, cash flows or financial condition, Kodak does not currently anticipate material expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations.
 
Kodak is focused on developing and delivering products and technologies that can drive sustainability performance by increasing operational efficiency, minimizing resource use, reducing costs over time and empowering customers to meet their own sustainability objectives.
 
The opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of its products and services is especially great for print products, as commercial printing has historically been a significant source of waste and pollution. Kodak is developing in-house life cycle assessment and carbon foot printing capabilities, which will help identify where the environmental footprint of Kodak’s products can be further reduced.

HUMAN CAPITAL
 As of January 1, 2023, Kodak employed approximately 4,200 employees across 35 countries. Kodak’s success greatly depends on identifying, attracting, engaging, developing, and retaining a highly skilled workforce in multiple areas within Kodak. Outside the U.S. there are employees in certain countries that are represented by unions or similar organizations, such as works councils, or are covered by collective bargaining agreements .
 
Kodak utilizes temporary staffing programs to develop a pipeline of talent and provide additional support during peak periods. This includes working closely with local schools to provide apprentice and intern programs. Approximately 2% of its workforce is temporary.
 
Diversity, Equality and Inclusion
 Kodak is focused on creating an inclusive and creative environment globally. Kodak strives to create a culture of inclusion, reduce bias in its talent practices, and invest in and engage with its communities. Kodak conducts diversity and code of conduct trainings with employees and managers to promote an inclusive and diverse workplace, where all individuals feel respected and part of a team regardless of their race, national origin, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity.
 
Kodak has achieved a score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index for over two decades and is included on its list of “Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality”.
 
Health, Wellness and Safety
 Kodak is dedicated to driving continuous safety improvement across its operations. Kodak’s approach includes identifying and mitigating risk, targeted training, information sharing on safe work practices, and thorough analysis of incidents and near misses.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic magnified the importance of keeping employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, Kodak has taken actions consistent with government mandates and continues to track active cases. The Executive Leadership Team reviews the impact of and responds to COVID-10 on a regular basis. Kodak will continue to emphasize the health and safety of its employees going forward.
