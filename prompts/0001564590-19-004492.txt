Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapeutic compounds to treat disease through the inhibition of the complement system, which is an integral component of the immune system, at the level of C3, the central protein in the complement cascade. We believe that this approach can result in broad inhibition of the principal pathways of the complement system and has the potential to effectively control a broad array of complement-dependent autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. 
 We have the most advanced clinical program targeting C3 with Phase 3 clinical trials of our lead product candidate, APL-2, in multiple indications. We believe that APL-2 has the potential to be a best-in-class treatment that may address the limitations of existing treatment options or provide a treatment option where there currently is none.  APL-2 has already shown activity that we believe is clinically meaningful in clinical trials for four distinct medical conditions - geographic atrophy in age-related macular degeneration, or GA; paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH; cold agglutinin disease, or CAD; and warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or wAIHA. In addition to trials for these indications, we are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of APL-2 in patients with glomerular diseases with complement involvement.
 We initiated a Phase 3 clinical program consisting of two Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating APL-2 in patients with GA in September 2018.  In our Phase 2 clinical trial of APL-2 in patients with GA, treatment with APL-2 resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of GA lesion growth over 12 months. In June 2018, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical program evaluating APL-2 in patients with PNH who are anemic while being treated with eculizumab, an approved therapy for PNH and in mid 2019 we plan to initiate a second Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with PNH who have not been treated with eculizumab. In our ongoing Phase 1b trials in PNH, APL-2 has achieved improvements in transfusion dependency, hemoglobin levels and other hematological indicators that we believe are clinically meaningful. In our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials of APL-2 in patients with CAD and wAIHA, patients with CAD and with wAIHA have achieved reduced extravascular hemolysis, measured by increased hemoglobin levels, reduced reticulocytes and bilirubin levels, and reduced intravascular hemolysis, measured by reduced lactate dehydrogenase.  We plan to continue clinical development of APL-2 for these indications.  We are developing novel compounds targeting C3 and plan to conduct clinical trials of these compounds in additional complement-dependent diseases. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to APL-2 and those other novel compounds targeting C3. 
 GA Program
 In GA, we are developing APL-2 to be injected intravitreally as a monotherapy. GA is an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, which is a disorder of the central portion of the retina characterized by progressive retinal cell death that ultimately leads to blindness. GA is a disease with significant unmet need that affects approximately one million patients in the United States and for which there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved therapies. In July 2018, we received fast track designation from the FDA for APL-2 in GA.
 Our ongoing Phase 3 clinical program in GA consists of two 600-patient prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, sham-injection controlled trials to assess the efficacy and safety of multiple intravitreal injections of APL-2 in patients with GA, with the goal of enrolling a total of 1,200 patients across approximately 200 sites worldwide. Patients in each Phase 3 trial receive a dose of 15 mg of APL-2 injected intravitreally in a 0.1 cc volume, monthly or every other month for 24 months. In the sham-injection cohorts, patients receive a simulated injection. As with our Phase 2 clinical trial, the primary endpoint of each trial is the change in total area of GA lesions in the study eye from baseline to month 12 compared to sham. The measurements of change will be analyzed at 12 months (primary endpoint) and 24 months. We dosed the first patient in the Phase 3 trials in September 2018. 
 
In October 2018, we announced that we voluntarily implemented a pause in dosing in our Phase 3 clinical program in patients with GA due to observed cases of non-infectious inflammation in patients treated from a single manufacturing lot of APL-2 intravitreal drug product.  We have also voluntarily implemented a pause in our Phase 1b/2 trial of APL-2 in patients with wet AMD.  A total of eight patients, four in the Phase 3 GA program and four in our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of APL-2 in patients with wet AMD, were treated with APL-2 from this manufacturing lot and each patient developed non-infectious inflammation.  Inflammation in all eight patients has completely resolved.  We have reviewed these events with the data safety monitoring board for our GA and wet AMD trials, conducted a series of non-human studies and introduced improvements to the manufacturing process. Based on these efforts, we believe that the source of inflammation resided in a contaminant or impurity in the active pharmaceutical ingredient.  We have decided to discontinue the Phase 1b/2 trial of APL-2 in patients with wet AMD.  We plan to provide an update on the status of the Phase 3 clinical program in GA by the end of the first quarter of 2019.  We continue to expect to be able to restart enrollment of our Phase 3 clinical program in GA during the next four months of 2019 and to have fully enrolled both trials in the GA program by the end of the first quarter of 2020, within the originally planned timeline for completion.

In 2018, we completed a Phase 2 trial of APL-2 in 246 patients in which APL-2 was administered as an intravitreal injection monthly or every other month for 12 months. In this trial, APL-2 achieved the primary endpoint of reduction in the rate of GA lesion growth at 12 months. Patients treated monthly with APL-2 showed a 29% reduction in the rate of GA lesion growth compared to sham, with a p-value of 0.008, and patients treated with APL-2 every other month showed a 20% reduction, with a p-value of 0.067. P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical results. In our Phase 2 trial, we set statistical significance as a p-value of 0.1 or less, meaning that there is a 1-in-10 or less statistical probability that the observed results occurred by chance rather than as a result of a treatment effect. Because the p-value of these results was less than 0.1, they are statistically significant. 
 Additionally, in a post hoc analysis of the Phase 2 trial, a greater effect was observed during the second six months of the treatment period compared to the first six months. During the second six months, we observed a reduction in the rate of GA lesion growth for patients for whom images were available at six and 12 months of 47% with monthly administration compared to sham, with a p-value of less than 0.001, and a reduction of 33% with administration every other month compared to sham, with a p-value of 0.01. These results are also statistically significant. 
 After the 12-month treatment period, patients were monitored for a further six months without treatment. During this monitoring period, the GA lesions in the previously treated groups grew at a rate similar to sham.  Patients who received monthly APL-2, and for whom images were available at 12 and 18 months, showed a 12% reduction in the growth rate of lesions over the six-month monitoring period compared to sham, while patients who received every other month administration of APL-2 showed a 9% reduction in the growth rate of lesions over the six-month monitoring period compared to sham.  These differences are not considered to be statistically significant.
 We also initiated a Phase 1b/2, multi-center, open label clinical trial to evaluate the safety of intravitreal APL-2 therapy in patients with wet AMD in the study eye in the second quarter of 2018. As with our Phase 3 program in GA, we voluntarily implemented a pause in our Phase 1b/2 trial of APL-2 in patients with wet AMD.  We have decided to discontinue this trial.
 PNH Program
 In PNH, we are developing APL-2 to be injected subcutaneously as a monotherapy. PNH is a rare, life-threatening, chronic, debilitating blood disorder characterized by the absence of certain proteins that normally regulate complement activity on the surface of blood cells. As a consequence, patients with PNH suffer from significant and chronic red blood cell loss, or hemolysis. The only therapies currently approved for the treatment of PNH, eculizumab (Soliris) and ravulizumab (Ultomiris), both of which are marketed by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., inhibit the complement system by targeting C5, a protein that is downstream from C3 in the complement cascade. Inhibitors that target C5 are limited to addressing only one of the two mechanisms of hemolysis in PNH. In a third-party study published in Blood in 2017, it was reported that over 70% of patients with PNH who are on treatment with eculizumab remain anemic and 36% of patients on eculizumab continue to require at least one transfusion per year.  These conditions are associated with a poor quality of life. By contrast, APL-2, because it targets C3, addresses both mechanisms of hemolysis and, we believe, may therefore significantly ameliorate anemia, reduce transfusions and improve patient quality of life for patients being treated with these approved therapies. 
 We initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with PNH in June 2018. This Phase 3 clinical trial, which we refer to as our PEGASUS trial, is a 70-patient randomized head-to-head trial comparing APL-2 monotherapy to eculizumab monotherapy in patients with PNH currently on treatment with eculizumab who have a hemoglobin level of greater than 10.5 g/dL, regarding of eculizumab dose or transfusion history. The treatment period of the trial consists of three parts: a four-week run-in period, a 16-week randomized treatment period and a 32-week open-label APL-2 only period. During the run-in period, all patients receive twice-weekly subcutaneous doses of 1,080 mg of APL-2 in addition to patients’ then current dose of eculizumab. The run-in period is designed to provide patients with sufficient plasma concentration of APL-2 to provide for what we expect to be adequate complement inhibition before withdrawing eculizumab. Following completion of the run-in period, patients will receive either 1,080 mg of APL-2 twice per week or their current dose of eculizumab through the duration of the 16-week randomized treatment period. The primary endpoint of the trial is the change in hemoglobin level from baseline at week 16. Following completion of the randomized treatment period with either APL-2 monotherapy or eculizumab monotherapy, all 70 patients will receive APL-2 monotherapy for 32 weeks in an open-label treatment period.  We expect to have completed enrollment for the PEGASUS trial by the end of the second quarter of 2019 and to report top-line data in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
We also plan to initiate a 48-patient Phase 3 clinical trial in patients who have not been treated with eculizumab, who we refer to as treatment-naïve patients, in mid 2019, which we refer to as the PRINCE study.
 In our Phase 1b trial of APL-2 for the treatment of PNH, treatment with APL-2 has been associated with improvements in transfusion dependency, levels of hemoglobin—the protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues of the body—and other hematological indicators that we believe are clinically meaningful. We made these observations both in the PADDOCK trial, which 
 3

enrolled treatment-naïve patients, and in the PHAROAH trial, which enrolled patients being treated with eculizumab who remained anemic and required frequent blood transfusions. In these Phase 1b trials, APL-2 has been generally well tolerated.  
 In our Phase 1b trial with patients treated with eculizumab, four of the six patients who had been treated with daily doses of 270 mg of APL-2 and with eculizumab continued on treatment until they completed the trial (2 years of dosing with APL-2).  These four patients received co-treatment with APL-2 and eculizumab for 16 to 22 months.   All four patients were discontinued from treatment with eculizumab based on decisions made by treating physicians and are continuing treatment with APL-2 as a monotherapy in a long-term extension study that we are conducting.
 We announced interim data from our Phase 1b trial of treatment-naïve patients at the 60th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology, or the ASH Conference, in December 2018 from 19 patients at baseline, 15 patients on treatment at day 85 and ten patients on treatment at day 169. The reported patients achieved transfusion independence with an average hemoglobin increase of 4.2 g/dL by day 85 to 12.2 g/dL and average reticulocytes decrease of 50% from 2.0x upper limit of normal, or ULN, to 1.0x ULN. LDH was reduced from 9.7x ULN at baseline to 0.9x at day 85 with 80% of patients achieving normal LDH.  The baseline hemoglobin was 8.0 g/dL (n=19) which increased to 10.8 g/dL (n=19) and 12.2 g/dL (n=15) at days 29 and 85, respectively. In the 12 months prior to screening, the reported patients had received an average of 8.7 units packed red blood cells (range 0-28). Each patient achieved transfusion independence while on APL-2 maintenance therapy with the exception of one patient with severe aplastic anemia at day 364. We believe that systemic inhibition of C3 with APL-2 may control both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis in PNH patients, as demonstrated by normalization of LDH, total bilirubin, and reticulocytes, which are all markers of hemolysis.
 We believe that our current clinical trial program for PNH will allow us to submit APL-2 for regulatory approval with the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA. 
 In April 2014, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for APL-2 for PNH.  In February 2019 we received fast track designation from the FDA for APL-2 for patients with PNH, which superseded the fast track designation we received in December 2016 for APL-2 for the subset of patients with PNH who continue to require transfusions despite receiving therapy with eculizumab. If our clinical development of APL-2 for PNH is successful, we believe that APL-2 could be a best-in-class therapy for PNH, differentiated by mechanism, and has the potential to significantly increase the quality of life of patients with PNH as compared to the current standard of care. 
 CAD Program
 In our CAD program, we are developing APL-2 to be injected subcutaneously as a monotherapy. In March 2018, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of APL-2 administered by subcutaneous injection in patients with CAD. CAD is a severe, chronic rare autoimmune disorder caused by pathogenic Immunoglobulin M antibodies that react with red blood cells at body temperatures below 30oC and leads to clumping, or agglutination, of red blood cells. Agglutinated red blood cells activate the complement system leading to destruction of the red blood cells. The disease is often characterized by chronic anemia, severe fatigue, and an increased risk of life-threatening events such as stroke. There are an estimated 10,000 CAD patients across the United States and Europe. There are currently no approved therapies for CAD.  
 In December 2018, we announced interim data from the Phase 2 trial at the ASH Conference. As of December 3, 2018, we had enrolled 12 patients with CAD in the Phase 2 trial, of which five patients had been treated for at least 56 days. In this clinical trial, treatment with APL-2 reduced extravascular hemolysis, measured by increased hemoglobin levels and reduced reticulocytes and bilirubin levels, and intravascular hemolysis measured by reduced LDH in patients with CAD.  We plan to provide additional data in the second quarter of 2019.  
 wAIHA Program
 In our wAIHA program, we are developing APL-2 to be injected subcutaneously as a monotherapy. In March 2018, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of APL-2 administered by subcutaneous injection in patients with wAIHA. wAIHA is a rare autoimmune disorder caused by pathogenic Immunoglobulin G antibodies that react with red blood cells and can activate the complement system leading to the premature destruction of red blood cells at normal body temperature. The disease is often characterized by profound, and potentially life-threatening anemia and other acute complications, including severe and life-threatening hemolysis, severe weakness, enlarged spleen or liver, rapid heart rate, chest pain, heart failure and fainting. There are estimated to be more than 30,000 wAIHA patients across the United States and Europe. There are currently no approved treatments for wAIHA.
 In December 2018, we announced interim data from the Phase 2 trial at the American Society of Hematology conference. As of December 3, 2018, we had enrolled nine patients with wAIHA, of which five patients had been treated for at least 56 days. In this clinical trial, treatment with APL-2 reduced extravascular hemolysis, measured by increased hemoglobin levels, reduced reticulocytes and bilirubin levels, and intravascular hemolysis measured by reduced LDH, in patients with wAIHA.  We plan to provide additional data in the second quarter of 2019.

Other Indications
 We are currently conducting a Phase 2 trial of APL-2 in four types of glomerular diseases in which complement has been implicated: C3 glomerulopathy, IgA nephropathy, primary membranous nephropathy and lupus nephritis. In December 2018, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of C3 glomerulopathy. We initiated this trial of APL-2 in patients with glomerular diseases with complement involvement in the first quarter of 2018 and plan to provide additional data in the second half of 2019.
 By combining our core expertise in complement inhibition with our deep understanding of complement immunology, we intend to expand our pipeline of potential treatment areas with APL-2 and with additional new product candidates, including APL-9, which we are developing for intravenous administration in systemic indications. 
 Our Approach 
 The complement system plays a pivotal role in both innate and adaptive immune systems. Complement proteins are produced primarily by the liver and circulate in the blood and through the body’s tissues. The complement system may be activated through three principal pathways, known as the classical, lectin and alternative pathways, each of which requires the C3 protein to enable three principal immune responses: opsonization, inflammation and formation of the membrane attack complex, or MAC. When C3 is activated, C3 fragments, such as C3b, tag cell surfaces in a process called opsonization, which marks the cells for removal from tissues or the bloodstream. Two other fragments, C3a and C5a, are released, contributing to inflammation in the surrounding tissues. Further complement activation causes membrane attack complex formation on cell surfaces, piercing holes and causing cells to lyse, or rupture. 
 The following figure depicts the complement system, its three principal activation pathways and its principal effects: 
 

Under conditions of excessive or uncontrolled activation, the complement system is believed to play a key role in the incidence and progression of several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In these diseases, the complement system acts directly through tissue destruction by the membrane attack complex and indirectly by signaling other elements of the immune system to inappropriately target otherwise healthy tissues. Because the contribution of complement activation to the development and progression of these diseases is not fully understood, it has been difficult to develop therapeutics that ameliorate the conditions contributing to these diseases by targeting only one of the complement activation pathways. 
 Complement activation and its effects can be inhibited in multiple ways. By targeting complement proteins upstream of C3, one of the three principal activation pathways can be inhibited. For example, inhibition of factor D results in inhibition of the alternative pathway, but not the classical or lectin pathways. The complement system can also be inhibited by targeting complement proteins 
 5

downstream of C3, which results in limited inhibition of complement effects. For example, inhibition of C5 leads to inhibition of the formation of the membrane attack complex and C5a-mediated inflammation but does not affect opsonization or C3a-mediated inflammation. 
 We have designed APL-2 to target complement proteins centrally at the level of C3. We believe that this approach can result in broad inhibition of the complement pathways and has the potential to effectively control complement-dependent diseases, including GA, PNH, CAD, wAIHA and glomerular diseases with complement involvement. We believe that APL-2 has the potential to be a best-in-class treatment and may address the limitations of existing treatment options or provide a treatment option where there is none. 
 We also believe that APL-2 may act as an immunotherapy, which refers to the clinical regulation of an overly permissive or overly aggressive immune system for therapeutic purposes. In the field of oncology, innovative approaches to immunotherapy have been used to correct an overly permissive immune system that fails to properly eliminate cancer cells. These approaches have led to unprecedented rates of prolonged disease-free survival in certain cancers. In autoimmune disease, we believe immunotherapy may be used to correct an overly aggressive immune system. We further believe that C3 inhibition has the potential to correct the immunological dysfunction that underlies multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases by enabling the natural regulatory mechanisms of immunity to normalize the immune response. We refer to this corrective approach as complement immunotherapy. As with cancer, we believe that the next breakthrough treatments in autoimmune disease may stem from novel approaches to immunotherapy, such as complement immunotherapy. 
 Strategy 
 We aim to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapeutics to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases through complement inhibition. To achieve this goal, we are pursuing the following strategies:  

• | Complete Phase 3 clinical development of APL-2 (intravitreal administration) in GA. We are developing APL-2 as monotherapy for GA, administered by intravitreal injections. We have initiated a Phase 3 clinical program consisting of two Phase 3 clinical trials of APL-2 in GA in the second half of 2018 with the goal of enrolling a total of 1,200 patients across approximately 200 sites worldwide. We dosed the first patient in the Phase 3 trials in September 2018. In October 2018, we announced that we had voluntarily implemented a pause in dosing patients in the Phase 3 clinical program due to observed cases of non-infectious inflammation in patients treated from a single manufacturing lot of APL-2 intravitreal drug product. We plan to provide an update on the status of the Phase 3 clinical program in the first quarter of 2019. We continue to expect to be able to restart enrollment of our Phase 3 clinical program during the next four months of 2019 and to have fully enrolled both trials by the end of the first quarter of 2020, within the originally planned timeline for completion.

• | Complete Phase 3 clinical development of APL-2 (systemic administration) in PNH. We are developing APL-2 as monotherapy for patients with PNH, administered by subcutaneous injection. We initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with PNH in June 2018. This Phase 3 clinical trial, which we refer to as our PEGASUS trial, is a 70-patient randomized head-to-head study comparing APL-2 monotherapy to eculizumab monotherapy in patients with PNH currently on treatment with eculizumab. We expect to have completed enrollment for the PEGASUS trial by the end of the second quarter of 2019 and to report top-line data in the fourth quarter of 2019. We also plan to initiate a 48-patient Phase 3 clinical trial in treatment-naïve patients, which we refer to as our PRINCE trial, mid 2019. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prepare for commercialization of APL-2. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to APL-2 and our other product candidates. As a result, we have the flexibility to develop and potentially commercialize products ourselves, or alternatively to seek to enter into collaborations with industry partners. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue clinical development of APL-2 (systemic administration) in CAD. We are developing APL-2 for patients with CAD, administered by subcutaneous injection. We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of APL-2 in patients with CAD in the first quarter of 2018, reported interim data in December 2018 and intend to provide additional data in the second half of 2019.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand APL-2 (systemic administration) into new indications with demonstrated complement involvement. Complement has been found to be implicated in multiple diseases. We believe that APL-2 has the potential to be an effective treatment for patients with these diseases. We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of APL-2 in glomerular diseases with complement involvement in the first quarter of 2018 and plan to provide additional data in the second half of 2019.

• | Expand our pipeline by developing new compounds and programs for other complement-dependent diseases. By combining our core expertise in complement inhibition with our understanding of immunology and the role of the complement system in disease, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to develop a pipeline of treatments for a broad range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We are developing new product candidates for the treatment of complement-dependent diseases, including APL-9, which we are developing for intravenous administration in systemic indications.

Our Programs 
 Our lead product candidate, APL-2, is a C3 inhibitor. APL-2 is a conjugate of a compstatin analogue, formulated both for intravitreal injection, which is an injection directly into the eye, and systemic administration by subcutaneous injection, which is an injection into the tissue under the skin.

 Ophthalmology (intravitreal APL-2) 
 Geographic Atrophy 
 Background 
 GA is a type of advanced age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. AMD is a disorder of the central portion of the retina in the eye, known as the macula, which is responsible for central vision and color perception. AMD affects vision in one or both eyes and results in progressive and chronic degeneration of the macula, often resulting in irreversible vision loss. AMD is a disease of aging, typically occurring after the age of 50. In the early stage of the disease, yellow deposits, or drusen, appear under the retina. Over time, the disease can progress to an intermediate stage where drusen deposits grow larger and other changes reflective of disease progression appear. Patients with intermediate AMD are at risk of progressing to GA or wet AMD. In contrast to intermediate AMD, these advanced forms are associated with progressive and often severe vision loss. GA is characterized by a degenerative process resulting in the progressive loss of retinal cells, which over the course of several years results in blindness. 
 Wet AMD is characterized by the rapid abnormal growth of blood vessels beneath the retina and leakage. If left untreated, wet AMD rapidly progresses to severe vision loss. Wet AMD is typically treated with anti-VEGF therapies. Some wet AMD patients require only a few anti-VEGF injections to resolve the condition and do not require further treatment. These patients have good long-term visual outcomes. Other patients become dependent on chronic and repetitive anti-VEGF injections. In a third-party study of wet AMD patients in clinical trials of an anti-VEGF therapy, known as the SEVEN-UP study, 98% of patients dependent on chronic and repetitive anti-VEGF injections developed GA within seven years and GA affected central vision in 90% of these patients. Based on the SEVEN-UP study, we believe that patients with wet AMD who receive chronic anti-VEGF therapies may suffer from significant long-term vision loss as the result of the development of GA. 
 7

According to the Brightfocus Foundation, over ten million people in the United States have some form of AMD. Based on published studies, we believe that at least one million people in the United States have GA. 
 The mechanism by which complement activation is upregulated and can damage the retina is poorly understood. However, we believe that the upregulation of complement activation due to immune dysregulation damages retinal cells in two ways. First, retinal cells are damaged by inflammation caused by increased levels of C3a and C5a. Second, the increased deposition of C3b on the cell surface of retinal cells caused by complement activation, combined with the limited ability of cells to remove C3 activated fragments such as C3b, leads to the accumulation of C3 fragments on the retinal cells. The presence of C3a and C5a, as well as C3 fragment deposition on retinal cells, activates macrophages and microglia. Macrophages are large white blood cells that form part of the immune system that engulf and digest cells, debris and foreign substances. Macrophages also play an important role in modulating other parts of the immune system. Microglia are a type of tissue-residing macrophage located in the brain, spinal cord and retina. 
 Because APL-2 both blocks the production of C3a and C5a and prevents the accumulation of C3 fragments on retinal cells through the inhibition of C3, we believe that APL-2 may allow the retinal environment to return to its quiescent state. We do not believe that selective inhibitors of the alternative pathway, such as lampalizumab, a complement factor D inhibitor, which only partially blocks the formation of C3b on the retinal cell surface, or C5 inhibitors, which cannot prevent C3b deposition on retinal cells, can cause the retinal environment to return to its quiescent state. 
 Current Therapies and Their Limitations 
 There are no therapies approved to treat GA. There are, however, therapies in development for GA. For instance, Zimura, a C5 inhibitor being developed by Ophthotech Corporation, is in Phase 2/3 trials. 
Benefits of Our Approach 
 We believe APL-2, with its inhibition of complement activation at the level of C3, may provide the following benefits: 
  
• | Prevention or reduction of the rate of retinal cell death progression. We believe APL-2 may mitigate or prevent retinal cell death in GA. In our Phase 2 trial of APL-2 in patients with GA, treatment with APL-2 resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of GA lesion growth over 12 months. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential application to all patients with GA independent of complement pathway causing disease progression. APL-2, by targeting C3, has been designed to inhibit all three principal complement activation pathways and may therefore be effective in a broad patient population. We believe, based on the genetic marker and other data from our analysis of the Phase 2 trial that the activity of APL-2 may not be dependent upon the activation of any particular complement pathway.

Clinical Development 
 We have initiated a Phase 3 clinical program following completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with GA. In August 2017, we completed the primary endpoint analysis for the 12-month treatment period in that trial and in February 2018 we completed the analysis of data from the six-month monitoring period. Prior to the GA trial, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of APL-2 in patients with wet AMD in 2016. In July 2018, we received fast track designation from the FDA for APL-2 in GA.
Phase 3 Clinical Program
 In September 2018, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical program to evaluate APL-2 for the treatment of GA.  The Phase 3 program in GA consists of two 600-patient prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, sham-injection controlled trials to assess the efficacy and safety of multiple intravitreal injections of APL-2 in patients with GA, with the goal of enrolling a total of 1,200 patients across approximately 200 sites worldwide. We dosed the first patient in our Phase 3 trial in September 2018. 
 
In October 2018, we announced that we voluntarily implemented a pause in dosing in our Phase 3 clinical program in patients with GA due to observed cases of non-infectious inflammation in patients treated from a single manufacturing lot of APL-2 intravitreal drug product.  We have also voluntarily implemented a pause in our Phase 1b/2 trial of APL-2 in patients with wet AMD.  A total of eight patients, four in the Phase 3 GA program and four in our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of APL-2 in patients with wet AMD, were treated with APL-2 from this manufacturing lot and each patient developed non-infectious inflammation.  Inflammation in all eight patients has completely resolved.  We have reviewed these events with the data safety monitoring board for our GA and wet AMD trials, conducted a series of non-human studies and introduced improvements to the manufacturing process. Based on these efforts, we believe that the source of inflammation resided in a contaminant or impurity in the active pharmaceutical ingredient.  We have decided to discontinue the Phase 1b/2 trial of APL-2 in patients with wet AMD.  We plan to provide an update on the status of the Phase 3 clinical program in GA by the end of the first quarter of 2019.  We continue to expect to be able to restart enrollment of 
 8

our Phase 3 clinical program in GA during the next four months of 2019 and to have fully enrolled both trials in the GA program by the end of the first quarter of 2020, within the originally planned timeline for completion. 
 Patients in each Phase 3 trial will receive a dose of 15 mg of APL-2 injected intravitreally in a 0.1 cc volume, monthly or every other month for 24 months.  In the sham-injection cohorts, patients receive a simulated injection. As with our Phase 2 clinical trial, the primary endpoint of each trial is the change in total area of GA lesions in the study eye from baseline to month 12 compared to sham. The measurements of change in lesion size will be analyzed at 12 months (primary endpoint) and 24 months. We set statistical significance as a p-value of 0.05 or less, meaning that there is a 1 in 20 or less probability that the observed results occurred by chance.  Patients who develop new onset exudation in the study eye will continue to be treated with APL-2 along with anti-VEGF injections, the current standard of care for wet AMD.  
 The observation intervals in pivotal studies in AMD are typically 24 months in total duration in order to meet regulatory requirements for long-term safety and to demonstrate durability of the treatment effect on anatomical and functional endpoints. However, based on our experience in the Phase 2 trial, we believe that APL-2 can show treatment effect at 12 months and we therefore plan to analyze the data after all patients have completed 12 months of treatment in the trial in addition to a second assessment after 24 months of treatment. This design is in line with the recommendations of the FDA and the EMA. 
 
Phase 2 Clinical Trial in GA 
 In the third quarter of 2015, we initiated a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, single-masked, sham-controlled clinical trial of APL-2 in patients with GA at more than 40 clinical sites, primarily located in the United States. We enrolled 246 patients in the trial. Patients were randomized in a 2:2:1:1 manner to receive APL-2 monthly, APL-2 every other month, sham injection monthly or sham injection every other month. Patients in the APL-2 arms received a dose of 15 mg of APL-2 injected intravitreally in a 0.1 cc volume, monthly or every other month for 12 months followed by six months of monitoring without treatment. In the sham-injection cohorts, patients receive a simulated injection. Study eyes received up to 13 injections in the monthly arm, and up to seven injections in the every other month arm. Eyes were evaluated for GA at the end of months two, six and 12 and will be evaluated at the end of month 18, in each case using fundus autofluorescence photographs. Fundus autofluorescence photographs are a standard imaging format used by ophthalmologists to measure and quantify clinical features of geographic atrophy. 
 We conducted this trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, or PK, and evidence of activity of multiple intravitreal injections of APL-2 in patients with GA in at least one eye. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in the square root of GA lesion size from baseline to month 12 in each treatment arm when compared to sham in the modified intent to treat population, which included 84 patients receiving administration of APL-2 every month, 78 patients receiving administration of APL-2 every other month and 80 patients in the group receiving sham injections. The primary safety endpoint was the number and severity of local and systemic treatment emergent adverse events. The trial was monitored by a safety monitoring committee. 
 Efficacy Analysis. We announced 12-month results of the Phase 2 trial in August 2017. After 12 months, patients treated monthly with APL-2 showed a 29% reduction in the rate of GA lesion growth compared to sham, with a p-value of 0.008, and patients treated every other month showed a 20% reduction compared to sham, with a p-value of 0.067. The rate of GA lesion growth in the sham was consistent with the rate of lesion growth in patients with GA in third-party historical studies. These data are shown in the figure below.

EOM = Every other month 
 We set statistical significance as a p-value of 0.1 or less, meaning that there is a 1-in-10 or less statistical probability that the observed results occurred by chance rather than as a result of a treatment effect. Because the p-value of these results was less than 0.1, they are statistically significant. 
 Additionally, in a post hoc analysis of the Phase 2 trial, a greater effect was observed during the second six months of the treatment period compared to the first six months. During the second six months, we observed a reduction in the rate of GA lesion growth for patients for whom images were available at six and 12 months of 47% with monthly administration compared to sham, with a p-value less than 0.001, and a reduction of 33% with administration every other month compared to sham, with a p-value of 0.01. These results are also statistically significant. This post hoc analysis, shown in the figure below, was conducted in fewer patients than were included in the primary endpoint analysis because only patients with images available at both six and 12 months could be analyzed post hoc. 
 
The activity of APL-2 was also shown in a post hoc analysis of the impact of APL-2 on patients with GA in both the study eye and the fellow eye, or bilateral GA. A published study has shown that growth rates of GA lesion size are similar in both eyes of patients with bilateral GA. We also made this observation in patients with bilateral GA in the sham group. In the trial, patients with bilateral GA received treatment with APL-2 in one eye and did not receive treatment in the other eye. We conducted this post hoc analysis because a comparison of effects in both eyes of individual patients allows the treatment effect of APL-2 to be analyzed independently of potential differences in the baseline characteristics of patients in each arm of the trial. In the trial, the rate of GA lesion growth in the study eye of patients with bilateral GA receiving administration of APL-2 every month was slower than the rate of growth in their fellow eye, with a p-value of 0.083. For the patients with bilateral GA receiving administration of APL-2 every other month, the rate of GA lesion growth was also slower in the study eye than the rate of growth in their fellow eye, but with a p-value greater than 0.1. In addition, in both treatment groups the rate of GA growth in the untreated fellow eye was slower than in the sham group. These results are shown in the figure below.

AM – APL-2 monthly; AEOM – APL-2 every other month. 
 As part of our review of the data, we also conducted an analysis of the treatment effect as measured by the rate of GA lesion growth in patients treated with APL-2 across multiple genetic subpopulations, including complement factor I (CFI) genotypes. We did not observe any difference in treatment effect across the subpopulations. 
 After the 12-month treatment period, patients were monitored for a further six months without treatment. During the monitoring period, the GA lesions in the previously treated groups grew at a rate similar to sham but the treatment effect was maintained for the full 18 months.  Patients who received monthly APL-2, and for whom images were available at 12 and 18 months showed a 12% reduction in the growth rate of lesions over the six-month monitoring period compared to sham, while patients who received every other month administration of APL-2 showed a 9% reduction in the growth rate of lesions over the six-month monitoring period compared to sham. These differences are not considered to be statistically significant. In the modified intent to treat population over the full 18-month period, patients who received monthly APL-2 showed a 20% reduction in the growth rate of lesions over the full 18-month period compared to sham, while patients who received every other month administration of APL-2 showed a 16% reduction in the growth rate of lesions over the full 18-month period compared to sham.
 Safety Analysis. The most frequently reported adverse events in the trial were associated with the injection procedure in the study eye. These adverse events included two cases of confirmed endophthalmitis and one case of presumed endophthalmitis where the culture tested negative for bacterial growth. In the latter case, the patient fully recovered visual acuity. In our Phase 2 trial, we observed an incidence rate of endophthalmitis of 0.21% per injection. We believe the incidence of endophthalmitis may be due in part to our use of a freeze-dried material requiring reconstitution prior to injection during our Phase 2 trial, which introduced an additional risk of contamination. We intend to use a liquid instead of the freeze-dried formulation in our Phase 3 trial, which we believe may reduce the incidence of endophthalmitis. 
 In addition, during the 12-month treatment period and the six-month monitoring period, we observed a higher incidence of new onset exudation in the study eyes treated with APL-2 as compared to sham, predominantly in patients with a history of wet AMD in the fellow eye. Specifically, we observed that, after the 12-month treatment period and the six-month monitoring period, 18 patients (21%) receiving administration of APL-2 every month and seven patients (9%) receiving administration of APL-2 every other month showed new onset exudation in the study eye, as compared to one patient (1%) in the sham group. 
 Patients who experienced new onset exudation in the study eye were discontinued from treatment with APL-2 and, in all but one case, treated with standard of care anti-VEGF injections under supervision. There was no meaningful negative impact on visual acuity resulting from the new onset exudations. 
 The development of new onset exudation by patients in the trial was communicated to the safety monitoring committee after six months of study data were available. The safety monitoring committee reviewed the cases of new onset exudation, and met several times to discuss the study data, including visual acuity, assessed the risks and benefits of continued treatment and decided that the trial should continue as planned. All mandated safety monitoring committee meetings have been held and no further safety monitoring committee meetings are scheduled. 
 We submitted a safety report to the FDA in April 2017 regarding these events, and the FDA has not communicated any concern or requested additional information with respect to these findings.

We observed a pronounced treatment effect in patients who experienced exudation in the study eye. In a post hoc analysis of the 12-month data, a subset of patients who experienced exudation in the study eye, and for whom images were available at baseline, two, six and 12 months, had pronounced reductions in the growth rate of GA lesion size as shown in the figure below. However, given the small number of patients in these groups, this observation was not statistically significant. 
 

 
Note: | Sample size for sham-total includes all sham patients and the sample size for all other groups includes patients who had images at baseline, two, six and 12 months.
------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also observed a treatment effect in patients who did not experience exudation in their study eye. In a post hoc analysis, when patients who experienced exudation in the study eye were excluded from the analysis, 71 patients receiving administration of APL-2 every month showed a 28% reduction in the growth rate of GA lesion size as compared to 80 sham patients, with a p-value of 0.011, and 73 patients receiving administration of APL-2 every other month showed a 24% reduction in the growth rate of GA lesion size as compared to sham, with a p-value of 0.028. 
 In a post hoc analysis of the 12-month data, after excluding patients with wet AMD in the fellow eye, five patients (10%) receiving monthly administration of APL-2 and two patients (4%) receiving administration every other month of APL-2 experienced exudation in the study eye. In the Phase 2 trial, a total of 93 patients (36%) had wet AMD in the fellow eye at the start of the trial, and we observed that these patients were more likely to show new onset exudation in the study eye than patients without wet AMD in the fellow eye. Wet AMD was present in 27% in the fellow eye of patients with GA in a published third-party study. 
 Phase 1b/2 Clinical Trial in Wet AMD
 We initiated a Phase 1b/2, multi-center, open label clinical trial to evaluate the safety of intravitreal APL-2 therapy when administered in parallel with anti-VEGF treatments in patients with wet AMD in the study eye in the second quarter of 2018.  As with our Phase 3 program in GA, we voluntarily implemented a pause in our Phase 1b/2 trial of APL-2 in patients with wet AMD.  We have decided to discontinue the Phase 1b/2 trial of APL-2 in patients with wet AMD. 
Phase 1 Clinical Trial in Low Vision Geography Atrophy
 We initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate the safety of monthly intravitreal treatments with APL-2 in up to 12 patients with GA secondary to AMD and with low vision in September 2018.
Phase 1 Clinical Trial 
 We conducted a Phase 1 open label, ascending single-dose clinical trial of APL-2 administered by intravitreal injection in patients with wet AMD who were receiving anti-VEGF therapy. We conducted the trial at multiple clinical sites both within and outside the United States to assess safety, tolerability and PK of APL-2. In this trial, patients received a single dose of APL-2 by intravitreal injection followed by 113 days of monitoring. We originally planned to enroll nine patients in the trial, in three cohorts of three patients each, at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg of APL-2. In August 2015, after completing enrollment of all three cohorts, we expanded the third cohort from three to 12 patients, for a total of 18 patients in this trial. 
 In this trial, APL-2 was well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were reported. Based on the results, we determined to evaluate a dose of 15 mg in our Phase 2 trial.

Preclinical Studies 
 We have conducted preclinical studies in monkeys to assess the safety of APL-2 injected intravitreally. A full toxicological review, including histopathological examinations of both eyes and of multiple additional tissues from each monkey revealed no evidence of APL-2-related toxicity changes at any of the doses tested. 
 Hematology (systemic APL-2) 
 Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria 
 Background 
 PNH is a rare, chronic, debilitating blood disorder that is most frequently acquired in early adulthood and usually continues throughout the life of the patient. Some of the prominent symptoms of PNH include severe anemia, a condition that results from having too few red blood cells, severe abdominal pain, severe headaches, back pain, excessive weakness, fatigue and recurrent infections. If not treated, PNH results in the death of approximately 35% of affected individuals within five years of diagnosis and 50% of affected individuals within ten years of diagnosis, primarily due to the formation of life-threatening blood clots inside the blood vessels, or thrombosis. Based on prevalence data published in an abstract in a peer-reviewed journal, we estimate that there are approximately 4,700 patients with PNH in the United States. 
 PNH is caused by the presence of mutant stem cells in the bone marrow that lack important proteins on their surface that protect against activation of the complement system. In patients with PNH, an autoimmune response targets and eliminates normal stem cells, enabling mutant cells to become dominant in the bone marrow. These mutant stem cells lead to mutant platelets and red blood cells that, unlike normal cells, are overly susceptible to activation or destruction by the complement system. Mutant platelets, activated by the membrane attack complex, increase the risk of thrombosis, which is the leading cause of mortality in patients with PNH. Mutant red blood cells are susceptible to destruction by intravascular and extravascular hemolysis. Intravascular hemolysis, which involves the destruction of blood cells within the blood vessels, is caused by the formation of the membrane attack complex on the surface of red blood cells causing them to rupture. Intravascular hemolysis causes severe anemia and contributes to the risk of thrombosis. Extravascular hemolysis, which involves the destruction of blood cells outside the blood vessels, is caused by C3-related opsonization on red blood cells leading to removal of the cells from the blood stream by the liver and the spleen. Extravascular hemolysis further contributes to severe anemia and transfusion dependency in patients with PNH.
 Current Therapies and Their Limitations 
 Eculizumab, marketed as Soliris, and ravulizumab, marketed as Ultomiris, both by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Alexion, are the only therapies that have been approved for the treatment of PNH. Alexion has reported that eculizumab had worldwide sales of more than $3.6 billion in 2018 for its three approved indications, PNH, atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, or aHUS, and refractory myasthenia gravis in ACHR+ adults. We believe the price per year for treatment with eculizumab is approximately $500,000 in adults. Eculizumab, which is administered every two weeks intravenously, or directly into the veins, is designed to treat PNH by targeting C5 and preventing the formation of the membrane attack complex and intravascular hemolysis. Many patients with PNH on treatment with eculizumab continue to be anemic. In addition, in a third-party study published in Blood in 2017, it was reported that over 70% of patients with PNH who are on treatment with eculizumab remained anemic and 36% of patients on eculizumab continued to require at least one transfusion per year.We believe that inability of eculizumab to control extravascular hemolysis is responsible in part for these continuing complications.  Ultomiris is administered intravenously every eight weeks and subcutaneously once per week and is designed to have a longer half-life and greater inhibition of C5 than eculizumab.   Ultomiris was tested in two Phase 3 non-inferiority trials with Soliris and was found to be non-inferior.  Hemoglobin levels for patients in the Phase 3 studies of Ultomiris have not been published.
Benefits of Our Approach 
 We believe that, because APL-2 inhibits complement activation at the level of C3, APL-2 may provide the following benefits in controlling PNH: 
  
• | Prevention of intravascular hemolysis and its consequences. APL-2 prevents the formation of the membrane attack complex and may thereby prevent the activation of mutant platelets and intravascular hemolysis, thus reducing the risk of thrombosis, the leading cause of mortality in PNH, as well as reducing anemia. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prevention of extravascular hemolysis and its consequences. APL-2 prevents C3b opsonization, and may thereby prevent extravascular hemolysis, further reducing anemia and transfusion dependency in patients with PNH. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease and convenience of use. We have formulated APL-2 so that it may be self-administered by patients with PNH by subcutaneous injection. Because APL-2 is stable at room temperature for weeks in liquid, patients will be able to self-administer APL-2 without a visit to the physician. We are initially developing APL-2 for self-administration, either daily 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

or less frequently (such as twice per week). We believe that the ability to self-administer APL-2 on a regular basis could improve the quality of life for patients with PNH. We are developing a drug delivery system to facilitate APL-2’s ease of use and self-administration for patients.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinical Development 
 Our clinical development program is guided by a planned commercial switch-over strategy for APL-2. Under this strategy, following marketing approval, we plan to allow PNH patients on treatment with eculizumab to assess the benefit of APL-2 in co-treatment with eculizumab for a limited time, before deciding to switch to APL-2 monotherapy or to revert to eculizumab monotherapy. 
 We initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with PNH in June 2018. This Phase 3 clinical trial, which we refer to as our PEGASUS trial, is a 70-patient randomized head-to-head trial comparing APL-2 monotherapy to eculizumab monotherapy in patients with PNH currently on treatment with eculizumab who have a hemoglobin level of greater than 10.5 g/dL, regarding of eculizumab dose or transfusion history. The treatment period of the trial consists of three parts: a four-week run-in period, a 16-week randomized treatment period and a 32-week open-label APL-2 only period. During the run-in period, all patients receive twice-weekly subcutaneous doses of 1,080 mg of APL-2 in addition to patients’ then current dose of eculizumab. The run-in period is designed to provide patients with sufficient plasma concentration of APL-2 to provide for what we expect to be adequate complement inhibition before withdrawing eculizumab. Following completion of the run-in period, patients will receive either 1,080 mg of APL-2 twice per week or their current dose of eculizumab through the duration of the 16-week randomized treatment period. The primary endpoint of the trial is the change in hemoglobin level from baseline at week 16. Following completion of the randomized treatment period with either APL-2 monotherapy or eculizumab monotherapy, all patients will receive APL-2 monotherapy for 32 weeks in the open-label part.  We expect to have completed enrollment for the PEGASUS trial by the end of the second quarter of 2019 and to report top-line data in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 We plan to initiate a 48-patient Phase 3 clinical trial in patients who have not been treated with eculizumab, who we refer to as treatment-naïve patients, in mid 2019, which we refer to as the PRINCE study.  
 We have conducted two clinical trials of APL-2 as part of our PNH program: a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with PNH being treated with eculizumab, which has concluded, and a Phase 1b clinical trial in treatment-naïve patients, which is ongoing. These trials were designed to assess safety and tolerability and whether APL-2 has the potential to control PNH. In these trials, we measured hemoglobin levels, which are significantly lower in patients with PNH, whether or not treated with eculizumab, and blood reticulocyte count, which is an indicator of overall hemolysis (both intravascular and extravascular) in patients on eculizumab. We also measured intravascular hemolysis based on LDH levels, which can be ten times higher than normal in patients with PNH, bilirubin, which is a breakdown product of hemoglobin and may be higher in patients who experience hemolysis, and the clonal distributions of normal red blood cells and mutant red blood cells unprotected from the membrane attack complex. 
 In both Phase 1b trials, patients treated with APL-2 have experienced reductions in LDH levels, and improved hemoglobin levels. Furthermore, we have observed lower reticulocyte counts in patients treated with APL-2, which we believe reflects that the bone marrow is producing fewer red blood cells because fewer red blood cells are destroyed by hemolytic activity. We believe that the clonal distribution of red blood cells in treated patients suggests that fewer mutant cells are destroyed by hemolytic activity.
 We believe that our current clinical trial program for PNH will allow us to submit APL-2 for regulatory approval with the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA. 
 In addition, we have conducted supporting trials to determine the safety, PK and pharmacodynamic, or PD, of APL-2 in healthy volunteers of Japanese descent and to determine the renal PK in healthy volunteers. We are also conducting a trial in healthy volunteers to assess the PK of a less frequent dosing regimen.   
 In July 2014, we submitted an IND to the FDA for the clinical development of APL-2 for the treatment of PNH. In April 2014, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for APL-2 for PNH.  In February 2019 we received fast track designation from the FDA for APL-2 for patients with PNH, which superseded the fast track designation we received in December 2016 for APL-2 for the subset of patients with PNH who continue to require transfusions despite receiving therapy with eculizumab. 
 In all trials of APL-2 administered systemically by subcutaneous injection, we have monitored the safety of our targeting of C3 closely. Individuals who lack functional levels of C3 or C5 have been shown to be susceptible to infection by certain bacterial species, including Neisseria meningitidis in C5-deficient individuals and Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in C3-deficient individuals. As a result, we vaccinate patients in these trials against these three pathogens, which we believe minimizes the risk of infection. In our clinical trials of APL-2 using subcutaneous administration, which we have conducted in more than 70 patients and healthy volunteers, we have not observed any infections of concern.

Phase 1b Clinical Trial with Patients on Eculizumab 
 We have recently completed a Phase 1b open-label, single and multiple ascending dose clinical trial of APL-2 in patients with PNH who are receiving eculizumab.  We initiated this trial in February 2015 and the last patient transitioned in October 2018 into a long-term extension study that we are conducting. The trial was conducted at multiple clinical sites in the United States. 
 In this clinical trial, doses of APL-2 were administered by subcutaneous injection to patients with PNH who were concurrently being treated with eculizumab at varying doses according to the treating physicians’ recommendations. We initially enrolled eight patients with PNH who participated in one of four cohorts. Each cohort was composed of two patients. The first two cohorts received a single dose of APL-2 ranging from 25 mg to 50 mg, and then, after a 28-day monitoring period, received daily doses of APL-2 for an additional 28 consecutive days at doses ranging from 5 mg/day to 30 mg/day. The other two cohorts received daily doses of 180 mg and 270 mg. Based on the combined safety and PD data from this and our other trials of APL-2, we amended the protocol to increase the number of patients in the fourth cohort to six and to provide that patients in the fourth cohort would receive a dose of 270 mg/day for up to two years. 
 APL-2 was generally well tolerated by the patients in the trial with 12 serious adverse events reported across three patients. Only one of these serious adverse events was noted as possibly related to the administration of APL-2. The patient with this serious adverse event, who had a history of elevated liver enzymes, experienced liver pain and elevated liver enzyme levels. As a result, treatment with APL-2 was temporarily discontinued but treatment with eculizumab continued. This discontinuation was followed by a recurrence of anemia and required a blood transfusion. Treatment with APL-2 was reinitiated at a dose of 180 mg and then increased to 270 mg, and the patient’s hemoglobin levels increased. The patient was diagnosed with a biliary obstruction and later underwent surgery to improve the flow of bile. This intervention resulted in a lowering of the liver enzyme levels, which thereafter remained low. 
 The first two cohorts, in which patients received a dose of 5 mg/day or 30 mg/day of APL-2 for 28 days, did not show evidence of pharmacological activity. In the third cohort, in which patients received a dose of 180 mg/day, there were relevant changes in hematological indicators. Hemoglobin levels increased in both patients during the first two weeks of treatment and remained stable until the end of treatment on Day 28. There was also a reduction in reticulocyte counts. No patient required a red blood cell transfusion during the treatment period, in contrast to the period prior to the start of dosing. 
 In the fourth cohort, six patients received single doses of 270 mg/day of APL-2 for 28 days. After 28 days of treatment, all six patients experienced clinical improvement associated with relevant changes in hematological indicators and APL-2 treatment was continued. Hemoglobin levels increased and reticulocyte counts decreased in all six patients, and reached the normal range in five of the six patients. LDH levels decreased in all six patients. Additionally, C3 fragment deposition on mutant red blood cells was reduced in these patients. In addition, during the six-month period following the 28-day monitoring period, the patients’ hemoglobin levels have remained in the normal range and LDH levels have continued to decrease.
 Four of the six patients in the fourth cohort received co-treatment with APL-2 and eculizumab for a total of between 16 and 22 months.   All four patients were discontinued from treatment with eculizumab based on decisions made by treating physicians and are continuing treatment with APL-2 as a monotherapy in our long-term extension study.
 Ongoing Phase 1b Clinical Trial with Treatment-Naïve Patients 
 We are conducting a Phase 1b open-label clinical trial of APL-2 in treatment-naïve patients with PNH that we initiated in December 2015. We are conducting this trial at multiple clinical sites outside of the United States. 
 We initially enrolled two cohorts of patients with PNH in this trial at doses of 180 mg/day of APL-2 for the first cohort of two patients and 270 mg/day for the second cohort of three patients. In this clinical trial, doses of APL-2 were initially administered by subcutaneous injection for up to 28 consecutive days. In the first quarter of 2018, based on the evidence of safety and activity observed during the first 28 days of treatment, we extended the administration period for the patients in the second cohort to one year and increased the number of patients who may be enrolled in the second cohort to 20 complement inhibitor naïve patients. As of February 15, 2019, APL-2 had been generally well tolerated in these patients with thirteen serious adverse events reported, across seven patients, all but one of which was considered unlikely to be related to administration of APL-2 and one of which, a hypersensitivity reaction possibly related to the administration of APL-2, resolved completely without complications. In late October 2017, we learned that one patient with concomitant aplastic anemia developed bone marrow failure after one year of treatment with APL-2. Treatment with APL-2 was discontinued for this patient on November 14, 2017.  The investigator determined that the bone marrow failure in this patient was not related to the administration of APL-2.
 In the first cohort in this trial, the two treatment-naïve patients with PNH completed 28 days of treatment with daily doses of 180 mg/day of APL-2 administered by subcutaneous injection. Reductions in LDH levels were observed in both patients from Day 1 to Day 29. Hemoglobin levels were maintained above 80 g/L in both patients and neither required a transfusion during the treatment period. Both, however, required transfusions within four weeks of discontinuing treatment with APL-2. 
 15

In the second cohort in this trial, the initial three enrolled treatment-naïve patients completed the initial 28-day treatment period with daily doses of 270 mg/day of APL-2 administered by subcutaneous injection. All three patients demonstrated reductions in LDH levels to within two times the upper limit of normal. All patients treated met the pre-determined criteria to continue dosing.  Of the three patients, one discontinued dosing after developing bone marrow failure, one continued dosing for more than 300 days before withdrawing due to a diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer that was determined to be unrelated to APL-2, and one withdrew consent for personal reasons. As part of the expansion of this cohort, we enrolled an additional 17 patients resulting in a total of 20 patients in the second cohort.   Of these additional 17 patients, as of February 26, 2019, 16 continue to receive treatment with APL-2 and as of February 26, 2019 all have been treated with APL-2 for at least six months.
 We announced interim data from our Phase 1b trial of treatment-naïve patients at the ASH Conference in December 2018 from 19 patients at baseline, 15 patients on treatment at day 85 and ten patients on treatment at day 169. The reported patients achieved transfusion independence with an average hemoglobin increase of 4.2 g/dL by day 85 to 12.2 g/dL and average reticulocytes decrease of 50% from 2.0x upper limit of normal, or ULN, to 1.0x ULN. Lactate dehydrogenase, or LDH, was reduced from 9.7x ULN at baseline to 0.9x at day 85 with 80% of patients achieving normal LDH.  The baseline hemoglobin was 8.0 g/dL (n=19) which increased to 10.8 g/dL (n=19) and 12.2 g/dL (n=15) at days 29 and 85, respectively. In the 12 months prior to screening, the reported patients had received an average of 8.7 units packed red blood cells (range 0-28). Each patient achieved transfusion independence while on APL-2 maintenance therapy with the exception of one patient with severe aplastic anemia at day 364. We believe that systemic inhibition of C3 with APL-2 may control both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis in PNH patients, as demonstrated by normalization of LDH, total bilirubin, and reticulocytes, which are all markers of hemolysis.
 Long-Term Extension Study
 We are conducting a long-term extension study of APL-2 in patients with PNH who participated in previous clinical trials with APL-2.  This study is an open label, non-randomized, multi-center study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of APL-2 in the treatment of PNH with dosing for a longer period and at doses of 1,080 mg given either twice a week or every three days. The study will be carried out with patients who were enrolled in our Phase 1b studies. The total number of participants will not exceed the total number who were in the previous trials. The main endpoints that will be evaluated are as follows: safety endpoints, including the incidence and severity of treatment emergent adverse events, incidence of thromboembolic events, laboratory parameters, and ECG parameters; efficacy endpoints, including hemoglobin level, LDH level, reticulocyte count, RBC transfusions and FACIT-fatigue scale score; and PK/PD endpoints, including APL-2 pharmacokinetic concentrations, CH50, AH50, and C3 levels, C3 deposition on RBC cells, and clonal distribution of PNH RBCs. We expect to continue the extension study until APL-2 becomes commercially available in the subject’s participating country, or until the development program for APL-2 in subjects with PNH is terminated.
Supporting Trials 
 We conducted a Phase 1 trial to assess the safety and tolerability of APL-2 in patients with renal impairment. The study will initially include one cohort of eight patients with severe renal impairment and a second cohort of eight control patients and will evaluate various PK endpoints, in addition to safety and tolerability endpoints.  No significant difference in PK parameters was noted.
 We conducted a Phase 1 trial to determine the safety, PK and PD of twice-weekly and once-weekly subcutaneous administration of APL-2 in healthy volunteers. We are evaluating whether less frequent administration provides comparable PK and PD profiles to daily subcutaneous administration and may enable less frequent dosing in upcoming clinical trials. 
 We conducted a Phase 1 trial to determine the safety, PK and PD of APL-2 in healthy volunteers of Japanese descent. We intend to evaluate whether APL-2 will have comparable PK and PD profiles in this population. No significant difference in PK parameters was noted.
 We discontinued the single-center, observational, prospective natural history study of patients with PNH.
Completed Phase 1 Clinical Trials—Single and Multiple Ascending Dose in Healthy Volunteers 
 We have completed both single ascending and multiple ascending dose Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of APL-2 in healthy volunteers. We conducted the trials at a single site in Australia to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of APL-2. 
 In the Phase 1 single ascending dose trial, APL-2 was administered by subcutaneous injection to healthy volunteers on the first day of the trial and followed by either 29 or 43 days of monitoring depending on dosing level. We enrolled 31 subjects in this trial. These subjects participated in one of six cohorts at doses ranging from 45 mg to 1440 mg. In the Phase 1 multiple ascending dose trial, APL-2 was administered by subcutaneous injection to healthy volunteers daily for 28 consecutive days followed by 56 days of monitoring after last dosing. We enrolled 20 subjects in this trial. These subjects participated in one of four cohorts at doses ranging from 30 mg to 270 mg/day. 
 16

A total of 24 subjects received single doses of APL-2 at doses up to 1440 mg and 16 subjects received multiple doses of APL-2 for 28 consecutive days at doses up to 270 mg/day. A total of eleven subjects received either single or multiple administrations of a placebo in these trials. 
 We observed the following in the trials: 
  
• | APL-2 was well tolerated in both trials with no serious adverse events reported;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the PK of APL-2 in humans was in line with our expectations derived from preclinical data, with little inter-subject variability observed;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in the multiple ascending dose trial, the plasma concentration of APL-2 increased over time, reaching maximum concentration after the last day of administration on day 28; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in both trials, we observed a dose-dependent increase in C3 that is indicative of APL-2 binding to C3.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In these trials, we assessed inhibition of hemolysis of red blood cells by using ex vivo serum-induced hemolysis. In the multiple ascending dose trial, at a dose level of 180 mg/day of APL-2, reduction of ex vivo serum-induced hemolysis was observed as early as seven days after initiation of treatment, continued for the duration of treatment, and reached a maximum of more than 80% in two of the four subjects who received 180/mg day of APL-2 and of more than 60% in the other two subjects. At the dose level of 270 mg/day of APL-2, reduction of ex vivo serum-induced hemolysis was observed as early as seven days after initiation of treatment, continued for the duration of treatment, and reached a maximum reduction of more than 90% in three of the four subjects who received 270 mg/day of APL-2. The fourth subject on active treatment had a more moderate reduction compared to placebo. 
 Preclinical Studies 
 We have conducted numerous preclinical studies of APL-2 in animals and in laboratory samples to assess the safety of APL-2, including repeat-dose subcutaneous and intravenous toxicity studies of APL-2 in rats, rabbits and monkeys for durations of up to nine months. In these studies, there were no significant macroscopically observable or clinical pathology drug-related changes in any species at any of the doses tested. Similarly, there was no evidence of a potential for adverse effects on myocardial conduction, cardiovascular and respiratory systems in either species and no genotoxicity potential was observed. In addition, no signs of infection were observed in any of the studies that we conducted. The main toxicity observed at the highest doses tested was microscopic kidney damage, likely resulting from accumulation of APL-2 in the kidney, which is one of the organs we believe to be responsible for its clearance from the body. 
 While there is no animal model of PNH, APL-2 inhibited both hemolysis of red blood cells by the membrane attack complex and C3 fragment deposition on the surface of these cells in preclinical studies that we conducted ex vivo on blood samples from patients with PNH. 
 Cold Agglutinin Disease (Systemic APL-2)
 Cold agglutinin disease, or CAD, is a severe, chronic rare autoimmune disorder caused by pathogenic immunoglobulin M antibodies that react with red blood cells at body temperatures below 30oC and leads to agglutination of red blood cells. Like other autoimmune hemolytic anemias, CAD is characterized by autoantibody-initiated premature destruction of red blood cells, chronic anemia, severe fatigue, and an increased risk of life-threatening events such as stroke. There are an estimated 10,000 CAD patients across the United States and Europe. The complement system plays a major role in red blood cell destruction in CAD through extravascular hemolysis, which corresponds to the removal and destruction of opsonized red blood cells from the blood vessels by the spleen or liver, and intravascular hemolysis, which corresponds to the destruction of the red blood cells following the formation of the membrane attack complex in the membrane of the red blood cells in the blood vessels. 
 We are developing APL-2 as a monotherapy for CAD. In March 2018, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of APL-2 administered by subcutaneous injection in patients with CAD.  In December 2018, we announced interim data for the Phase 2 trial at the ASH Conference. As of December 3, 2018, we had enrolled 12 patients with CAD in the Phase 2 trial, of which five patients had been treated for at least 56 days. Treatment with APL-2 reduced extravascular hemolysis, measured by increased hemoglobin levels and reduced reticulocytes and bilirubin levels, and intravascular hemolysis, measured by reduced LDH, in these five CAD patients.  
 For the patients with CAD, we observed that:
  
• | Mean hemoglobin levels increased from 8.7 g/dL (n=12) at baseline to 12.1 g/dL (n=5) at day 56, a 3.4 g/dL increase. Two patients have reached day 168 and had a mean hemoglobin level of 12.6 g/dL.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17

 
• | Mean absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) decreased from 137.5 10⁹/L (n=11) at baseline to 46.6 10⁹/L (n=5) at day 56, with a mean ARC of 70.8 10⁹/L (n=2) at day 168
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mean bilirubin decreased from 1.9 mg/dL (n=12) at baseline to 0.5 mg/dL (n=5) at day 56
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mean LDH decreased from 487.8 U/L (n=12) at baseline to 173.4 U/L (n=5) at day 56 with a mean LDH of 143.5 U/L (n=2) at day 168
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There is no FDA-approved drug therapy specifically for CAD. The primary and secondary therapies, which include corticosteroids, splenectomy, alkylating agents and immunosuppressive drugs, are associated with low response rates, relapses and clinically significant adverse effects. 
 We believe that C3 inhibition has the potential to prevent C3-related opsonization and extravascular hemolysis in patients with CAD, and that inhibiting the complement system by targeting C3 may have the same impact, if not greater, as other complement pathway drugs in these diseases. 
 Warm Antibody Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (Systemic APL-2) 
 Warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or wAIHA, is a rare autoimmune disorder caused by pathogenic Immunoglobulin G antibodies that react with red blood cells and can activate the complement system leading to the premature destruction of red blood cells at normal body temperature. As with CAD, the complement system plays a major role in red blood cell destruction in wAIHA through extravascular hemolysis, which corresponds to the removal and destruction of opsonized red blood cells from the blood vessels by the spleen or liver, and intravascular hemolysis, which corresponds to the destruction of the red blood cells following the formation of the membrane attack complex in the membrane of the red blood cells in the blood vessels. wAIHA is often characterized by profound, and potentially life-threatening anemia and other acute complications, including severe and life-threatening hemolysis, severe weakness, enlarged spleen or liver, rapid heart rate, chest pain, heart failure and fainting. There are estimated to be more than 30,000 wAIHA patients across the United States and Europe.  
 In March 2018, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of APL-2 administered by subcutaneous injection in patients with wAIHA. In December 2018, we announced interim data for the Phase 2 trials at the American Society of Hematology conference. As of December 3, 2018, we had enrolled nine patients with wAIHA, seven of which tested positive for the presence of complement C3 using a Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) (C3+ wAIHA).  We believe that a positive C3 DAT indicates a disease mechanism that is more likely to be responsive to C3 inhibition.  As of December 3, 2018, five of these C3+ wAIHA patients had been on treatment with APL-2 for at least 56 days.  Treatment with APL-2 reduced extravascular hemolysis, measured by increased hemoglobin levels and reduced reticulocytes and bilirubin levels, and intravascular hemolysis, measured by reduced LDH, in these five C3+ wAIHA patients.  
 For the seven patients with C3+ wAIHA, we observed that:
  
• | Mean hemoglobin increased from 9.3 g/dL (n=7) at baseline to 11.3 g/dL (n=5) at day 56, a 2.0 g/dL increase.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mean absolute reticulocyte count decreased from 185.5 10⁹/L (n=7) at baseline to 61.1 10⁹/L (n=5) at day 56
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mean bilirubin decreased from 0.8 mg/dL (n=7) at baseline to 0.4 mg/dL (n=6) at day 56
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mean LDH decreased from 306.9 U/L (n=7) at baseline to 150.2 U/L (n=5) at day 56. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There is no FDA-approved drug therapy specifically for wAIHA. The primary and secondary therapies, which include corticosteroids, splenectomy, alkylating agents and immunosuppressive drugs, are associated with low response rates, relapses and clinically significant adverse effects. 
 We believe that C3 inhibition has the potential to prevent C3-related opsonization and extravascular hemolysis in patients with wAIHA, and that inhibiting the complement system by targeting C3 may have the same impact, if not greater, as other complement pathway drugs in these diseases. 
 Nephrology (systemic APL-2) 
 Glomerular Diseases with Complement Involvement
 IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, primary membranous nephropathy and C3 glomerulopathy are diseases in which complement activation is believed to play an important role in kidney injury.  In all four diseases, C3 activation products are found deposited in glomeruli, the filtering units of the kidney.  APL-2 is designed to prevent C3 activation, and as such, we believe it has the potential to 
 18

prevent further deposition of C3 activation products in the glomeruli, which may protect the kidney from further injury.  We met with the FDA in October 2017 in a pre-IND meeting and submitted an IND to the FDA in November 2017.
 In February 2018, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of APL-2 in biopsy-proven C3 glomerulopathy, IgA nephropathy, primary membranous nephropathy and lupus nephritis to evaluate safety and biologic activity of APL-2 in patients with these glomerular diseases.  We plan to enroll up to 12 patients per disease.  Each patient will receive once daily subcutaneous infusions of up to 360 mg of APL-2 for one year. The primary efficacy endpoint for all four diseases is the reduction in proteinuria from baseline to week 48. Based on the scientific literature as well as the underlying pathophysiology of the disease, we believe that a substantial reduction in proteinuria is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit in all four glomerular diseases.  We plan to report data from these patients in the second half of 2019.  In December 2018, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of C3 glomerulopathy.
 
Other Complement-Dependent Diseases
 We are developing APL-9 for intravenous administration in systemic indications.  We are conducting a single ascending dose Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of APL-9 in healthy volunteers. This trial will enable us to determine the safety, PK and PD of APL-9. In this trial, APL-9 is being administered either as a single IV dose infused over 30 minutes or as a slow bolus IV loading dose to provide rapid pharmacological complement inhibition followed by a continuous IV infusion to maintain pharmacological levels of APL-9 for the desired duration.  Complement activity resumes shortly after the termination of the IV infusion. 
Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position in a variety of ways, including by pursuing patent protection in certain jurisdictions where it is available. For example, we file U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 We have developed our lead product candidate, APL-2, which is an analog of the cyclic peptide compstatin, based on technology that we have exclusively licensed from the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, or Penn, including a license agreement with Penn that was assigned to us in connection with our acquisition of the assets of Potentia in September 2015. The intellectual property in-licensed under our two license agreements with Penn includes four U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent applications, including original filings, continuations and divisional applications, and numerous foreign counterparts, with claims granted or pending in Europe, Japan and elsewhere. These licensed patent rights include issued patents with claims that recite a class of compounds generically covering our lead product candidate, APL-2, and that specifically recite the active component. These patents have terms that extend to 2026. 
 In addition to the intellectual property licensed from Penn, as of December 31, 2018, we own a total of nine U.S. patents and 14 pending U.S. patent applications, including original filings, continuations and divisional applications, as well as numerous foreign counterparts of many of these patents and patent applications. Our patent applications include families of US and foreign applications relating, for example, to certain compstatin analogs with a prolonged in vivo half-life, including APL-2, and/or to methods of treatment and dosing regimens for treating particular complement-dependent diseases. Patents in these families would expire in 2032 or 2033. Our patent applications also include families relating in part to particular doses and dosing regimens for intravitreally or subcutaneously administered APL-2. Patents based on these applications would expire between 2036 and 2038. Finally, the filings include certain U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications relating to methods of treating eye disorders associated with complement activation, which we acquired in the acquisition of Potentia’s assets. These acquired Potentia patent rights include issued U.S. patents with claims to methods of treating AMD by administration of compstatin analogs and a granted European patent with claims to a class of compstatin analogs for use in treatment of macular degeneration. These patents have terms that extend into 2026. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each 
 19

regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. 
 Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates, including APL-2, receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. Expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term adjustment or extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us. 
 We granted rights to use our intellectual property to manage our Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in Australia and exclusive rights to distribute our product within Australia, South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and New Zealand to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Apellis Australia Pty Ltd. 
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. 
 Patent License Agreement with The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania (Non-ophthalmic Fields of Use) 
 In March 2008, Apellis AG entered into an agreement with Penn for an exclusive worldwide license, under specified patent rights controlled by Penn, to develop and commercialize products covered by the licensed patent rights for all fields except the treatment of ophthalmic indications. This license was assigned to us in 2010 in connection with our acquisition of Apellis AG, and we have the right to grant sublicenses under this license. 
 The patent rights licensed to us by Penn include patents with claims that recite a class of compounds generically covering our lead compound, APL-2, and specifically recite APL-1. 
 In exchange for the rights licensed from Penn, Apellis AG transferred to Penn shares of Potentia common stock that it had purchased from Potentia with a $250,000 promissory note in 2008. In 2010, Apellis AG assigned its Penn license to us together with the promissory note. We repaid the promissory note in full in 2013. 
 Under the license agreement, we are obligated to make a $100,000 annual license maintenance payment to Penn until the first commercial sale of a licensed product, some of which may become creditable against milestone payments under specified circumstances. We may also become obligated to make payments to Penn aggregating up to $1,650,000 based on achieving specified development and regulatory approval milestones and up to $2,500,000 based on achieving specified annual sales milestones with respect to each of the first two licensed products, and to pay low single-digit royalties to Penn based on net sales of each licensed product by us and our affiliates and sublicensees and specified minimum quarterly royalty thresholds. In addition, we are obligated to pay Penn a specified portion of income we receive from sublicensees.  
 In 2018 we made payments of $375,000, net of a credit for the annual license maintenance payment, for the achievement of milestones under this agreement.
 Our royalty obligation with respect to each licensed product in a country extends until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire patent licensed from Penn covering the licensed product in the country or the expiration of a specified number of years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product in the country. 
 The agreement obligates us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products in accordance with a development plan, which we update annually, and a development milestone timetable specified in the agreement and to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize licensed products. 
 Penn has the right to terminate the agreement if we breach the agreement and fail to cure our breach within specified cure periods or in the event of specified bankruptcy, insolvency and liquidation events. We have the right to terminate the agreement for our convenience at any time on 60 days’ notice to Penn. 
 Amended and Restated Patent License Agreement with The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania (Ophthalmic Field of Use) 
 At the same time that it entered into the agreement with Apellis AG, Penn licensed rights to the same portfolio of cases to Potentia, to develop and commercialize products covered by the licensed patent rights for the treatment of ophthalmic indications. In 
 20

September 2015, Potentia assigned the license agreement between Potentia and Penn to us in connection with our acquisition of the assets of Potentia pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with Potentia. 
 Upon Potentia’s assignment of the license to us, we became the licensee and are obligated to make a $100,000 annual license maintenance payment to Penn until the first commercial sale of a licensed product. We also became obligated to make payments to Penn aggregating up to $3,200,000 based on achieving specified development and regulatory approval milestones and up to $5,000,000 based on achieving specified annual sales milestones with respect to each licensed product, and to pay low single-digit royalties to Penn based on net sales of each licensed product by us and our affiliates and sublicensees and specified minimum quarterly royalty thresholds. In addition, we are obligated to pay Penn a specified portion of income we receive from sublicensees. 
 In 2018 we made payments of $650,000, net of a credit for the annual license maintenance payment, for the achievement of milestones under this agreement.
 Our royalty obligation with respect to each licensed product in a country will extend until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire patent licensed from Penn covering the licensed product in the country or the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in the country. 
 We have the right to grant sublicenses under the license. 
 We also are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products in accordance with a development plan, which we will update annually, and a development milestone timetable specified in the agreement and to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize licensed products. 
 Penn has the right to terminate the agreement if we breach the agreement and fail to cure our breach within specified cure periods or in the event of specified bankruptcy, insolvency and liquidation events. We have the right to terminate the agreement for our convenience at any time on 60 days’ notice to Penn. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 There are a number of currently marketed products and product candidates in preclinical research and clinical development by third parties to treat the various diseases that we are targeting. In general, these products and product candidates can be categorized based on their proposed mechanisms of action. The mechanisms of action for these product candidates include inflammation suppression by agents such as complement inhibitors and corticosteroids, as well as immune modulators, visual cycle modulators, anti-amyloid agents, antioxidants, neuroprotectants, cell and gene therapies and vascular and interstitial tissue remodeling agents. 
 If our lead product candidate is approved for the indications for which we are currently undertaking or planning clinical trials, it will compete with the products and product candidates discussed below. 
 GA.    There are currently no approved treatments for GA. We are aware that there are a number of companies that are actively developing product candidates for the treatment of GA, including the following product candidates that are in clinical development: CLG561, an anti-properdin monoclonal antibody being developed as a monotherapy or adjunctive therapy with LFG316, an anti-C5 monoclonal antibody being developed by Novartis AG that is in Phase 2 clinical trials; Zimura, a C5 inhibitor being developed by Ophthotech Corporation that is in Phase 2/3 clinical trials; and other product candidates that do not target the complement system that are in Phase 2 clinical trials, including compounds being developed by Allergan PLC and Regenerative Patch Technologies. 
 PNH.     Eculizumab and ravulizumab, C5 complement inhibitors, marketed as Soliris and Ultomiris, respectively, by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., are the only drugs approved for the treatment of PNH. Ravulizumab is designed to have a longer half-life and greater inhibition of C5 than eculizumab. In addition, we are aware that there are a number of other companies that are actively developing product candidates for the treatment of PNH, including the following: 

• | AMY-101, a product candidate directed at C3 complement inhibition that is currently in early clinical development by Amyndas Pharmaceuticals SA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21

 
• | product candidates directed at C5 complement inhibition such as ALN-CC5, an RNAi therapeutic targeting C5 being developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. that is in early clinical trials, Coversin, a small protein inhibitor of C5 being developed by Akari Therapeutics, Plc. that is in Phase 2 clinical trials, Ra101495, a cyclic peptide inhibitor of C5 that is currently in Phase 2 development by Ra Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and LFG316, an anti-C5 monoclonal antibody that is currently in Phase 2 trials by Novartis;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other product candidates directed at other mechanisms of complement inhibition such as NM-9405, an anti-properdin antibody in preclinical development by NovelMed Therapeutics, Inc., and ACH-4471 (previously ACH-CFDIS), an orally available small molecule inhibitor of complement factor D, that is currently in early clinical development by Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Amgen is developing ABP959, a biosimilar for eculizumab that is in Phase 3 clinical development.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 CAD.    There are no currently marketed drug treatments for CAD, but there are currently treatments in development for CAD, including: 
  
• | Fostamatinib, a spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed by Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is now in Phase 2 trials in CAD and wAIHA patients; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | TNT-009/BIVV009, a C1s monoclonal antibody inhibitor, which is being developed by Bioverativ Inc., and is in Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with CAD.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 wAIHA.    There are no currently marketed drug treatments for wAIHA, but there are currently treatments in development for wAIHA, including fostamatinib, which is in Phase 2 trials for wAIHA.  Alexion has announced plans to initiate a pivotal trial of ALXN1830, a humanized monoclonal antibody currently in Phase 1b/2a clinical trials, in 2019.
 Glomerular Diseases with Complement Involvement. There are no currently marketed drug treatments for glomerular diseases with complement involvement, but OMS721, a human monoclonal antibody to mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2) that blocks the lectin pathway, is being developed by Omeros Corp. as a treatment for IgAN and is in Phase 3 clinical trials. Voclosporin, an immunosuppressant, being developed by Aurininia Pharmaceuticals for lupus nephritis is in Phase 3 clinical trials, and avacopan, an oral C5aR-inhibitor being developed by ChemoCentryx, Inc. for C3 glomerulopathy, is in Phase 2 clinical trials.
 Sales and Marketing 
 We hold worldwide commercialization rights to all our product candidates. We plan to build focused capabilities to commercialize development programs for certain indications where we believe that the medical specialists for the indications are sufficiently concentrated to allow us to effectively promote the product with a targeted sales team. In other indications, we may seek to enter into collaborations that we believe may contribute to our ability to advance development and ultimately commercialize our product candidates. We may also seek to enter into collaborations where we believe that realizing the full commercial value of our development programs will require access to broader geographic markets or the pursuit of broader patient populations or indications. 
Manufacturing 
 We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. Although we intend to rely on third-party contract manufacturers to produce our products, we have recruited personnel with experience to manage the third-party contract manufacturers producing our product candidates and other product candidates or products that we may develop in the future. 
 The process for manufacturing our product candidates consists of chemical synthesis, purification using liquid chromatography, and freeze drying into solid form. The drug substance is then dissolved in solution and aliquoted into small vials for individual dosing.  Each of these steps involves a relatively routine chemical engineering process. We expect the costs associated with manufacturing drug product for our product candidates may be comparable to the current manufacturing costs for other similarly sized peptide-based components.
 We have engaged a limited number of third-party manufacturers to provide all of our raw materials, drug substances and finished products for use in clinical trials. Our raw materials, drug substances and finished products have been produced under master service contracts and specific work orders from these manufacturers pursuant to agreements that include specific supply timelines and volume and quality expectations. We choose the third-party manufacturers of the raw materials and drug substances based on the volume required and the regulatory requirements at the relevant stage of development. All lots of drug substances and finished products used in clinical trials are manufactured under current good manufacturing practices. Separate third-party manufacturers are for fill and finish services and for labeling and shipment of the final drug products to the clinical trial sites.

We have introduced improvements to the manufacturing process in order to eliminate impurities like those that we believe caused inflammation in our Phase 3 trials in GA and our Phase 1b/2 trial in wet AMD. A new lot of the APL-2 active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) incorporating these improvements has been manufactured and is ready for release in a quantity sufficient to complete both the GA Phase 3 clinical trials. We believe that the improved manufacturing process can be used to supply API at a scale required for global commercialization. In non-clinical testing, treatment with API manufactured through the improved manufacturing process did not cause inflammation. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approvals 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, pricing, reimbursement, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities, including state agencies.
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Before an applicant begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage.  Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among 
 23

other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 Companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the investigational product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 The IND and IRB Processes 
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. 
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed. 
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain FDA requirements in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Those requirements provide that such studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects.
 In addition to the IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory 
 24

alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application. 
 When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
 On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established (and the 2017 Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act later amended) a requirement that sponsors of one or more investigational drugs for the treatment of a serious disease(s) or condition(s) make publicly available their policy for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients. Although these requirements were rolled out over time, they have now come into full effect.  This provision requires drug and biologic companies to make publicly available their policies for expanded access for individual patient access to products intended for serious diseases. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy
 Human Clinical Studies in Support of an NDA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4: Post-approval studies, which are conducted following initial approval, are typically conducted to gain additional experience and data from treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in 
 25

accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Safety and Innovation Act, or the FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. For drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. 
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
 Submission of an NDA to the FDA 
 Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2019 is $2,588,478 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for federal fiscal year 2019 is $309,915. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or FDARA, the FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain drug applications, including applications for drugs in a shortage or drugs for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report. 
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for 
 26

prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations 
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and regenerative advanced therapy designation. 
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Second, a product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
 Fourth, with passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.
 Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
 27

For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. There is limited experience with accelerated approvals by the FDA based on intermediate clinical endpoints. However, the FDA has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA 
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 28

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In the United States, healthcare professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, the FDA’s regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementation regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, which regulates the distribution of and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCSA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. 
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD. 
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug...” 
 Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 
 29

Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. 
 The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved. 
 Under FDARA, a priority review track will be established for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within eight months for a drug that has three or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The new legislation also authorizes the FDA to expedite review of “competitor generic therapies” or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application. 
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. 
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval). 
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population 
 30

studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. With regard to patents, the six-month pediatric exclusivity period will not attach to any patents for which a generic (ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA) applicant submitted a paragraph IV patent certification, unless the NDA sponsor or patent owner first obtains a court determination that the patent is valid and infringed by a proposed generic product. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will be receiving orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Those circumstances include instances in which another sponsor’s application for the same drug product and indication is shown to be “clinically superior” to the previously approved drug. In this context, clinically superior means that the drug provides a significant therapeutic advantage over and above the already approved drug in terms of greater efficacy, greater safety or by providing a major contribution to patient care. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
 Under FDARA, orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another orphan drug under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. The new legislation reverses prior precedent holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 
 Review and Clearance or Approval of Medical Devices in the United States 
 Medical devices in the United States are strictly regulated by the FDA. Under the FDCA, a medical device is defined as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part, or accessory which is, among other things: intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes. This definition provides a clear distinction between a medical device and other FDA regulated products such as drugs. If the primary intended use of the product is achieved through chemical action or by being metabolized by the body, the product is usually a drug. If not, it is generally a medical device. 
 Unless an exemption applies, a new medical device may not be marketed in the United States until it has been cleared through filing of a 510(k) premarket notification, or 510(k), or approved by the FDA pursuant to a premarket approval application, or PMA. The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes on the basis of 
 31

the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices have the lowest level or risk associated with them, and are subject to general controls, including labeling, premarket notification and adherence to the Quality System Regulation, or QSR. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards. Class III devices, which have the highest level of risk associated with them, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are subject to most of the aforementioned requirements as well as to premarket approval. 
 A 510(k) must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device, or predicate device, that did not require premarket approval. In evaluating a 510(k), the FDA will determine whether the device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and (a) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device, or (b) has different technological characteristics, and (i) the data supporting substantial equivalence contains information, including appropriate clinical or scientific data, if deemed necessary by the FDA, that demonstrates that the device is as safe and as effective as a legally marketed device, and (ii) does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device. Most 510(k)s do not require clinical data for clearance, but the FDA may request such data. The FDA seeks to review and act on a 510(k) within 90 days of submission, but it may take longer if the agency finds that it requires more information to review the 510(k). If the FDA concludes that a new device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the new device will be classified in Class III and the manufacturer will be required to submit a PMA to market the product. 
 Modifications to a 510(k)-cleared medical device may require the submission of another 510(k) or a PMA if the changes could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or constitute a major change in the intended use of the device. Modifications to a 510(k)-cleared device frequently require the submission of a traditional 510(k), but modifications meeting certain conditions may be candidates for FDA review under a Special 510(k). If a device modification requires the submission of a 510(k), but the modification does not affect the intended use of the device or alter the fundamental technology of the device, then summary information that results from the design control process associated with the cleared device can serve as the basis for clearing the application. A Special 510(k) allows a manufacturer to declare conformance to design controls without providing new data. When the modification involves a change in material, the nature of the “new” material will determine whether a traditional or Special 510(k) is necessary. 
 A clinical trial is typically required for a PMA application and, in a small percentage of cases, the FDA may require a clinical study in support of a 510(k) submission. A manufacturer that wishes to conduct a clinical study involving the device is subject to the FDA’s IDE regulation. The IDE regulation distinguishes between significant and non-significant risk device studies and the procedures for obtaining approval to begin the study differ accordingly. Also, some types of studies are exempt from the IDE regulations. A significant risk device presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. Significant risk devices are devices that are substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or in preventing impairment to human health. Studies of devices that pose a significant risk require both FDA and an IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study. Non-significant risk devices are devices that do not pose a significant risk to the human subjects. A non-significant risk device study requires only IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study.
 Review and Approval of Combination Products in the United States 
 Certain products may be comprised of components that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and frequently by different Centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be: 
  
• | a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a drug or device packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug or device where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any investigational drug or device packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the FDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. That determination is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a device-drug combination product is attributable to the drug product, the FDA Center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review 
 32

process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.
  Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 Procedures Governing Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 
 Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an E.U. member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 
 To obtain marketing approval of a product under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all E.U. member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. 
 Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 
 The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various E.U. member states where such product has not previously received marketing approval in any E.U. member states. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. 
 If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 
 Clinical Trial Approval 
 Requirements for the conduct of clinical trials in the European Union including Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, are set forth in the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the GCP Directive 2005/28/EC. Pursuant to Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC, as amended, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national 
 33

legislation of the E.U. member states. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the competent national authority of each E.U. member state in which a study is planned to be conducted. To this end, a clinical trial application is submitted, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier, or IMPD, and further supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and other applicable guidance documents. Furthermore, a clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application in that country. 
 In April 2014, the European Union passed the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, which will replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The Regulation was published on June 16, 2014 but is not expected to apply until 2019. To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the European Union, the new E.U. clinical trials legislation was passed as a regulation that is directly applicable in all E.U. member states. All clinical trials performed in the European Union are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC until the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 becomes applicable. The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC will, however, still apply three years from the date of entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation to (i) clinical trials applications submitted before the entry into application and (ii) clinical trials applications submitted within one year after the entry into application if the sponsor opts for old system. 
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trial in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the E.U. portal; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures that will spare sponsors from submitting broadly identical information separately to various bodies and different member states; a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts—Part I is assessed jointly by all member states concerned. Part II is assessed separately by each member state concerned; strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications; and the involvement of the ethics committees in the assessment procedure in accordance with the national law of the member state concerned but within the overall timelines defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. 
 As in the United States, similar requirements for posting clinical trial information are present in the European Union (EudraCT) website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/ and other countries.  
 PRIME Designation in the EU
 In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist.  The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure.  Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies.  Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted.  Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level.  A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union 
 In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product. 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA 
 34

approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals 
 Marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the European Union market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Regulation 141/2000 provides that a drug shall be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Community when the application is made, or that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Community and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Community would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Community or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
 Regulation 847/2000 sets out criteria and procedures governing designation of orphan drugs in the European Union. Specifically, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. This period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of “clinically relevant superiority” by a similar medicinal product, or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a member state in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs pursuant to Regulation 141/2000 shall be eligible for incentives made available by the European Community and by the member states to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan drugs. 
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom (U.K.) voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the U.K. provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the E.U. Treaty. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the U.K. covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the U.K. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the U.K. 
 The U.K. has a period of a maximum of two years from the date of its formal notification to negotiate the terms of its withdrawal from, and future relationship with, the European Union. If no formal withdrawal agreement is reached between the U.K. and the European Union, then it is expected the U.K.’s membership of the European Union will automatically terminate two years after the submission of the notification of the U.K.'s intention to withdraw from the European Union. Discussions between the U.K. and the European Union focused on finalizing withdrawal issues and transition agreements are ongoing. However, limited progress to date in these negotiations and ongoing uncertainty within the U.K. Government and Parliament sustains the possibility of the U.K. leaving the European Union on March 29, 2019 without a withdrawal agreement and associated transition period in place, which is likely to cause significant market and economic disruption.
 General Data Protection Regulation
 
35

The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater.  The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR.  Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. 
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our product candidates will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. 
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.

Healthcare Law and Regulation 
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted regulatory approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease or order of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willingly executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on covered entities and their business associates that associates that perform certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on their behalf;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 
 In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidates are: 
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 37

 
• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% (and 70% starting January 1, 2019) point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Since enactment of the ACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by the President on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.”  The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, will become effective in 2019.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise.  Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices.  Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”.
 The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA.  Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. One Executive Order directs federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The second Executive Order terminates the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Further, on June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known.
 Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimburs
ement methodologies for drug products. For example, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and

proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.  For example, on May 11, 2018, the Administration issued a plan to lower drug prices.  Under this blueprint for action, the Administration indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will: take steps to end the gaming of regulatory and patent processes by drug makers to unfairly protect monopolies; advance biosimilars and generics to boost price competition; evaluate the inclusion of prices in drug makers’ ads to enhance price competition; speed access to and lower the cost of new drugs by clarifying policies for sharing information between insurers and drug makers; avoid excessive pricing by relying more on value-based pricing by expanding outcome-based payments in Medicare and Medicaid; work to give Part D plan sponsors more negotiation power with drug makers; examine which Medicare Part B drugs could be negotiated for a lower price by Part D plans, and improving the design of the Part B Competitive Acquisition Program; update Medicare’s drug-pricing dashboard to increase transparency; prohibit Part D contracts that include “gag rules” that prevent pharmacists from informing patients when they could pay less out-of-pocket by not using insurance; and require that Part D plan members be provided with an annual statement of plan payments, out-of-pocket spending, and drug price increases.
 
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing.  We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
