ITEM 1. Business.
The Company
 
BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc. (BioForce or the Company) was previously in the business of manufacturing nano-particular measurement devices and molecular printers, but due to a lack of profitability, the subsidiary of the company that owned that technology filed for bankruptcy. That subsidiary and related technology was later bought out of bankruptcy by an unrelated third party. Subsequently, new management came into the Company to pursue a better business model and now the Companys mission is to become a leading provider of natural vitamins, minerals and other nutritional supplements, powders and beverages, formulated to promote a healthier lifestyle for active individuals in all age ranges. The Company private labels products with key distributors and manufacturing providers.
 
BioForce entered into the supplement business in or about 2015. These supplements, powders and beverages offer vitamins and minerals to complement a healthy intake of protein and carbohydrates for active individuals and participants in sports.
 
BioForce recently changed its business plan and it is in the process of establishing a dynamic marketing campaign to achieve brand awareness of its product offerings to drive business growth through sales of nutrition supplements to retailers, sporting goods retailers, supermarkets, mass merchandisers, and online. BioForce currently markets its products through social media and telemarketing. The Company plans to expand marketing efforts with a direct marketing and B2B (Business to Business) sales campaign, with the eventual expectation to expand throughout the entire United States.
 
The Company proactively seeks to expand its BioForce Eclipse nutritional powder for use into households throughout the U.S., and the Company will approach retail stores, including health food and sporting goods stores to create a vendor relationship. During this phase, the Company will continue to try to advance its social media platform with direct online and targeted advertisements to health conscience individuals.
 
Nutrition retailers, grocery stores, retail pharmacies, and online stores, like Amazon, will be important channels for the Companys Eclipse product-lines. In The USA, there are thousands of direct outlets like grocery stores, pharmacies, hospitals, department stores, medical clinics, surgery clinics, universities, nursing homes, prisons, and other facilities which are all targets of potential sales of the vitamin and mineral supplemental products.
 
The Company plans to offer its products for direct sales on its website at www.bioforceeclipse.com.

The approximate $35.0 billion vitamin and supplement manufacturing industry grows on average 2.5% annually.
 
The Company will seek out retail sales opportunities with gyms, health clubs, and fitness centers with incentive base sales agreements based on volume of sales obtained.
 
Currently, the Company BioForce Eclipse, a private label brand powder supplements. The product is a mixture of amino acids, key vitamins, and other plant based proteins, essential to the physical well-being of the individual. Protein supplements are known to promote muscular growth, so athletes or others often take them as a dietary supplement to gain muscle mass.
 
Nutritional Products are made up of a wide range of products, which include supplements, meal replacement products, multivitamins, and convenience products. As these products have increased in popularity, more individuals have been attempting to get in optimal physical condition, wanting to use products that complement their lifestyles, exercise, or athletic regimen. BioForces Management is aware of other potential products and will continue to evaluate these potential markets and possible new products lines.
 
BioForce entered into a market that has some reputable players, but has limited leadership. BioForce will work to get the product available through most retail channels, so that customers will see both convenience in purchasing the product, and convenience over having to take numerous different supplements. After BioForce launches its products into the sports nutrition supplement industry, it is anticipated that there will be other firms that will work to offer similar products. This fact magnifies the importance of BioForces quality and its support of its products.
 
The initial marketing efforts will focus on the online stores, B2B sales, direct mail, industry trade shows, conventions, and affiliate marketing designed to educate prospective users and distributors, including retail channels, doctors and gyms. Less direct methods will include TV and radio advertising until such time as the Companys budget allows it to upgrade its marketing plan and to do so effectively.
 
BioForce Nanosciences Holdings, Inc. maintains an executive office in Virginia Beach, Virginia. All marketing, sales, and customer support will be managed from its Virginia Beach Office. Private labeling is done on a contractual basis unless an opportunity to vertically integrate production makes fiscal sense.
 
BioForce Nanosciences Holdings sells the BioForce Eclipse powder multivitamin and mineral supplement without non-compete and non-disclosure agreements. The Company currently private labels the powder through a manufacturer located in Virginia. The Company has a Supplier Agreement with this manufacturer that gives the Company non-exclusion rights to market the product. The distributor owns the rights to the formula for this product. If the Company can source product in a more cost-effective way without diminished quality, the Company would evaluate such opportunities when presented. Currently, the distributor who provides the private label powder provides Consignment Terms, which allows us to only pay for the product when it is sold. 
 
In addition to manufacturing the product, this private label vitamin distributor also offers custom labeling and packaging of the product. BioForce utilizes these services, and will seek out examples from other potential manufacturer and distributor of future products to ensure that the quality of work reflects the Companys standards for presentation and quality.

The FDA has rules regarding the fitness for consumption of foods as well as vitamins and supplements sold to the public, and those laws apply to our product. However, our product does not require pre-clearance like a drug in order to be sold into the marketplace. 
 
BioForces management understands that similar competing products are available to the consumer, and customers may consider switching from BioForce Eclipse to a competitors product. Manufacturers and distributors who provide private label services generally incentives larger orders, which the Company might not be financially able to provide. Management remains conscience of changes in the marketplace, its relationship with the Private Label manufacture distributor, and other risk associated with supply chain issues.
 
BioForces dietary supplements and vitamins cannot take the place of a well-balanced diet. Some people believe that the ingestion of supplements, pills and beverages can make up for poor eating habits; but vitamin and mineral supplements dont offer a wellness solution. None of BioForces products are approved by the FDA and are sold without doctors prescriptions through the Companys marketing channels.
 
The Company caters to the needs of customers with a focus on the elderly and athletes across numerous sports, ages, and economic backgrounds. 
 
The Company plans to offer numerous products beyond nutritional supplement powder, but will only offer products that advance the BioForce product-line name, BioForce Eclipse (See Fig. 1-product labels).
 
The aging baby boomers, report regular use of multivitamin and multi-mineral supplements at a higher rate than other demographic group. Recent surveys have indicated that women, Caucasians, individuals with higher education levels, people with lower body mass indexes and people with higher physical activity levels were more likely to use supplements. These groups were also most likely to talk to a doctor about the need for supplements, because they knew about their benefits, they are subject to a higher risk of deficiencies, or had a family history of medical type issues.
 
Health conscience Baby Boomers, sports participants, and other active individuals continue to extend their health education awareness. The industrys traditional focus on these groups is shifting to an ever-expanding group that includes recreational and lifestyle users, such as fitness enthusiasts, weekend athletes and gym-goers, of all ages.
 
BioForce will provide its consumer base with products that serve their health needs, and which add value even beyond their needs. The Company first introduced its multivitamin and mineral supplemental powder product, BioForce Eclipse in December, 2014. With the introduction of this first product, BioForce advances the Companys name offering additional products that meet the standards for a healthy lifestyle. BioForce Eclipse is a private label branding produced by Body Align, LLC from a distributor located in Virginia, USA.
 
The Company had no customer during its 2021 and 2022 fiscal years. Customers are not required to purchase the product in the future and the Companys marketing plan is to broaden the Companys customer base.
 
The Company intends to increase its U.S. market share by offering new incentives and promotions to attract customers on trying its products. The Company intends to market a new biodegradable, recyclable container of its products to attract enviromentally conscience customers and to develop new markets. BioForce will evaluate the success of its marketing objectives and determine which marketing strategy provides the best results. As sale volumes increase, we expect that it will become necessary to hire sales associates.
