------------+---------

Overview
 
On September 29, 2018 (the “Closing Date”), we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) with Blind Faith Concepts Holdings, Inc. a Nevada corporation (the “Seller”) whereby we completed the acquisition of 100% of the assets of “NFID” from the Seller. We plan to develop NFID as an exclusive brand of clothing consisting initially of sweatshirts, hoodies, pants, t-shirts, and hats. Our clothing brand will feature non-binary work wear-inspired clothing for the revolutionarily-spirited person.
 
We are developing the streetwear apparel brand, NFID, which stands for “No Found Identification”. The streetwear collection is inspired by music, fashion and captures the social consciousness of popular culture. The brand unapologetically celebrates the freedom of choice and expression. Generational political shifts have changed the way younger generations express and interpret gender, particularly in youth subculture and countercultural movements. While today’s youth culture rebellion is gender neutral, there is no single brand providing a uniform for the expression of that rebellion.
 
Our Business
 
Product and Service Offerings
 
Branded hooded sweatshirts, shirts, and hats will be the initial product launch while options for footwear are developed. The business model is uses concepts of “Less is More” and utilizes social media and the “Have to Have” market. This is achieved through limited quantities and styles released strategically to generate maximum trending on social media platforms.
 
Combining the right product with a branding message around unisex, the MeToo Movement, Times Up, and various current issues, the company is investigating possible alignments with a notable charity organization to further leverage is recognition as a socially relevant new brand
 
Commercial Market Strategy
 
Our strategy involves developing the NFID brand through a direct to consumer (“DTC”) sales model, fed into by parallel digital marketing strategies, including collaboration with established brands throughout industry categories as well as seeding to celebrities/social media influencer sponsorships and viral product placement.
 
Parallel to this strategy is a series of targeted influencer We plan on leveraging relationships with core social media influencers of youth culture’s rebellion who have strong voices in the streetwear community.
 
We plan on sponsoring NFID events rather than mass marketing. These events are individually planned and social series that will consist of intimate cultural events in New York City and other cities, rather than a single large one-size-fits-all event. These smaller events will ultimately drive sales in multiple markets and expand the brand reach.
 
For example, we will select a group of 10-15 buzzworthy cultural influencers and/or relevant celebrities to dine at a location such as political dissent, free speech, gender expression, cult film screenings, and culinary pop-ups an industrial space in a hub or affluent hipster heavy neighborhood that seats a minimum 60-70 people. We are developing plans to create a database of each customer of consumer information.
 
NFID.com is expected to launch its apparel in the second quarter this year and begin generating revenues.

Corporate Background
 
Point Capital, Inc. was incorporated under its original name Gold Swap, Inc. under the laws of the State of New York on July 13, 2010. On December 11, 2012, shareholders approved changing the Company’s state of incorporation from New York to Delaware by the merger of Gold Swap with and into its wholly-owned subsidiary, Point Capital, Inc., and to change the name of the Company from “Gold Swap Inc.” to “Point Capital, Inc.” The merger was effective on January 24, 2013.
 
Through September 28, 2018, we were a closed-end, non-diversified investment company that had elected to be regulated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”).  As a business development company, we were required to comply with certain regulatory requirements.  For instance, we generally had to invest at least 70% of our total assets in “qualifying assets,” including securities of private U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less.
 
On September 29, 2018, we filed Form N-54C, Notification of Withdrawal of election to be Subject to Section 55 through 65 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, whereas we have changed the nature of our business so as to cease to be a business development company. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2018, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (the “U.S. GAAP”).
 
As a result of this change in status, we shall discontinue applying the guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 946 - Financial Services – Investment Company and shall account for the change in its status prospectively by accounting for its equity investments in accordance with ASC Topics 320 - Investments—Debt and Equity Securities as of the date of the change in status. Additionally, the presentation of the financial statements will be that of a commercial company rather than that of an investment company.

In accordance with ASC 946, we are making this change to our financial reporting prospectively, and not restating periods prior to our change in status to a non-investment company effective September 29, 2018, Accordingly, in this report, we may refer to both accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) applicable to corporations (Corporation Accounting), which applies commencing September 29, 2018 and to that applicable to investment companies under the 1940 Act (Investment Company Accounting) which applies to prior periods. However, pursuant to ASC 205 – Presentation of Financial Statements, Section 205-10-50-1, “Changes Affecting Comparability”, certain amounts in the 2017 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2018 presentation. These reclassifications primarily effect the presentation of revenues and expenses in the statements of operations and presentation of assets in the balance sheet. Additionally, the schedules of investments are not presented for 2018 or 2017. We determined that there is no cumulative effect of the change from Investment Company Accounting to Corporation Accounting on periods prior to those presented and that there is no effect on our financial position or results of operations as a result of this change.
 
In order to maintain its status as a non-investment company, we will now operate so as to fall outside the definition of an “investment company” or within an applicable exception. The Company expects to continue to operate outside the definition of an “investment company” as a company primarily engaged in the business of developing and selling apparel products.
 
Through March 31, 2017, we elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operated in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. At March 31, 2017, we failed this diversification test since our investment in IPSIDY INC. (formerly ID Global Solutions Corporation) (“IDTY”) accounted for over 25% of our total assets. We did not cure our failure to retain our status as a RIC and we will not seek to obtain RIC status again. Accordingly, beginning in 2017, we are subject to income taxes at corporate tax rates. The loss of the Company’s status as a RIC did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations.
 
Currently, we are not making any new equity investments.
 
On September 29, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) with Blind Faith Concepts Holdings, Inc. a Nevada corporation (the “Seller”) whereby we completed the acquisition of 100% of the assets of “NFID” from the Seller which consisted of three trademarks related to the NFID brand, the NFID website, shoe designs and samples, and the assumption of a one-year Brand Ambassador Agreement in exchange for 2,000,000 shares of common capital stock of the Company. NFID is a recently developed unisex clothing brand. We plan on continuing product development to fully launch the product. Our acquisition of the NFID assets gives us access to the growing market for unisex products. 
 
Pursuant to the terms of the APA, the Company agreed to issue 2,000,000 shares of common capital stock of the Company in exchange for 100% of the NFID assets.
 
On November 5, 2018, we entered into 14 separate Return to Treasury Agreements, whereby certain shareholders holding an aggregate of 28,734,901 shares of common stock of the Company agreed to return a portion of their respective holdings to treasury in exchange for cash payments aggregating $2,872. As a result, the total issued and outstanding number of shares of common stock of the Company was reduced by 28,734,901.
 
At December 31, 2018, all of the fair value of the Company’s equity investments, at fair value is concentrated in one entity in the biometric technology industry, which gives rise to a risk of significant loss should the performance or financial condition of this industry or the portfolio company deteriorates.
 
Our transfer agent is West Coast Stock Transfer, Inc., 721 N. Vulcan Ave. Ste. 205, Encinitas, CA 92024. Their telephone number is (619) 664-4780.

Competition
 
The streetwear industry is a $75 billion industry with robust secondary markets, e-commerce disruptors, and a vast ecosystem of competing blue-chip companies. Industry digital media and e-commerce platform Hypebeast filed for a groundbreaking IPO back in 2016.
 
The largest competitor is “hype brand” Supreme which was given a $1 billion valuation upon selling a minority stake to private equity firm Carlyle Group following a successful collaboration with high fashion staple, Louis Vuitton. NOAH, is a New York-based utilitarian men’s streetwear brand that uses cross-platform collaborations with subcultural icons to penetrate the market.
 
Governance
 
Our Board of Directors monitors and performs an oversight role with respect to our business and affairs, including with respect to investment practices and performance, compliance with regulatory requirements and the services, expenses and performance of our service providers. Among other things, our Board of Directors approves the appointment of our officers, reviews and monitors the services and activities performed by our officers, and provides overall risk management oversight.  
 
Our Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities. The Audit Committee is composed of Van Parker, Committee Chairman, Joel Stone, and Leonard Schiller. The Audit Committee’s responsibilities include overseeing our accounting and financial reporting processes, our systems of internal controls over financial reporting, and audits of our consolidated financial statements, and approval of the engagement, and reviews the performance of, our independent registered public accounting firm.
 
Employees
 
We currently have no employees and our Chief Executive Officer provides service on a part-time basis. Our chief executive officer is also a director and our Chief Financial Officer.  All functions including development, strategy, negotiations and administration are currently being provided by our executive officers or outsourced to service providers. Our officer and directors do not work exclusively for us and do not devote all of their time to our operations. Their other activities prevent them from devoting their full-time to our operations.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
 
From incorporation through December 31, 2013, we were treated as a corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). From January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016, we elected to be treated for tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Code. As discussed below, since March 31, 2017, we failed the RIC diversification test. As of December 31, 2018 and through the date of this report, we had not cured our failure to retain our status as a RIC and we will not retain our RIC status. Accordingly, beginning in 2017, we are subject to income taxes at corporate tax rates. 
 
During the periods we qualified as a RIC, we did not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any investment company taxable income (which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses) or any realized net capital gains (which is generally net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses) that we would have been required to distribute to our stockholders if we would have generated taxable income. We were subject to United States federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any investment company taxable income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. During the periods we were a RIC, we did not generate any taxable income.
 
Since we did not generate investment company taxable income in any taxable years, we were not required to make any distributions to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement.
 
Since March 31, 2017, we failed the RIC diversification test since one of our investments accounted for approximately 78% of our total assets. If we were to correct the failure, we should have disposed of the asset causing the failure within six months of the end of the quarter in which we identified the failure to cure the failure and we would be required to pay an excise tax of $50,000.

As of December 31, 2018 and through the date of this report, we had not cured our failure to retain our status as a RIC and we do not intend to retain our RIC status. Accordingly, beginning in 2017, we are subject to income taxes at corporate tax rates.
 
Regulation as a BDC
 
Initially we elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act requires that a majority of our directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC without the approval of a “majority of our outstanding voting securities,” within the meaning of the 1940 Act.
 
On September 29, 2018, we filed Form N-54C, Notification of Withdrawal of election to be Subject to Section 55 through 65 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, whereas we have changed the nature of our business so as to cease to be a business development company.
