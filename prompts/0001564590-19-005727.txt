We have prepared our accompanying consolidated financial statements under GAAP and the rules and regulations of the SEC. Our accounting records are maintained in U.S. dollars and all references to dollars in this report are to U.S. dollars, except where stated otherwise. Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned and/or controlled subsidiaries, and all significant intercompany items have been eliminated in consolidation. The address of our principal executive offices is 811 Louisiana Street, Suite 2100, Houston, Texas 77002, and our telephone number at this address is (713) 584-1000.
 Our Operations
 We are engaged in the business of:
  
• | gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting and selling natural gas;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | storing, fractionating, treating, transporting and selling NGLs and NGL products, including services to LPG exporters;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | gathering, storing, terminaling and selling crude oil; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | storing, terminaling and selling refined petroleum products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 To provide these services, we operate in two primary segments: (i) Gathering and Processing, and (ii) Logistics and Marketing (also referred to as the Downstream Business). 
 Our Gathering and Processing segment includes assets used in the gathering of natural gas produced from oil and gas wells and processing this raw natural gas into merchantable natural gas by extracting NGLs and removing impurities; and assets used for crude oil gathering and terminaling. The Gathering and Processing segment's assets are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeast New Mexico (including the Midland, Central and Delaware Basins); the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; the Barnett Shale in North Texas; the Anadarko, Ardmore, and Arkoma Basins in Oklahoma (including the SCOOP and STACK plays) and South Central Kansas; the Williston Basin in North Dakota; and the onshore and near offshore regions of the Louisiana Gulf Coast and the Gulf of Mexico.
 
Our Logistics and Marketing segment includes the activities and assets necessary to convert mixed NGLs into NGL products and also includes other assets and value-added services such as storing, fractionating, terminaling, transporting and marketing of NGLs and NGL products, including services to LPG exporters; storing and terminaling of refined petroleum products and crude oil and certain natural gas supply and marketing activities in support of our other businesses. The Logistics and Marketing segment also includes the Grand Prix Pipeline (“Grand Prix”), as well as our equity interest in the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline (“GCX”), which are both currently under construction
 and expected to begin operations during 2019. Grand Prix, once operational, will integrate our gathering and processing positions in the Permian Basin, Southern Oklahoma and North Texas with our downstream facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas. The associated assets, including these pipeline projects, are generally connected to and supplied in part by our Gathering and Processing segment and, except for the pipeline projects and smaller terminals, are located predominantly in Mont Belvieu and Galena Park, Texas, and in Lake Charles, Louisiana.

Acquisitions and Organic Growth Projects
 Since the founding of our predecessor company in 2003, and since 2010, the year of our initial public offering, we have expanded our midstream natural gas and NGL services footprint substantially. The expansion of our business has been fueled by a combination of third-party acquisitions and major organic growth investments in our businesses. Third-party acquisitions included our 2012 acquisition of Saddle Butte Pipeline LLC’s crude oil pipeline and terminal system and natural gas gathering and processing operations in North Dakota (referred to by us as “Badlands”), our 2015 acquisition of Atlas Pipeline Partners L.P. (“APL,” renamed by us as Targa Pipeline Partners LP or “TPL”), and our 2017 acquisition of gas gathering and processing and crude oil gathering assets in the Permian Basin (referred to by us as the “Permian Acquisition”). As a result of these transactions, we acquired natural gas gathering, processing and treating assets in West Texas, South Texas, North Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, as well as crude oil gathering and terminal assets in North Dakota and West Texas.
 We also continue to invest significant capital in our businesses and in Grand Prix, which connects many of our gathering and processing operations to our Downstream Business. We have invested approximately $8.3 billion in growth capital expenditures since 2010, including approximately $3.2 billion in 2018. These expansion investments are distributed across our businesses, with 53% to Gathering and Processing and 47% related to Logistics and Marketing. We expect to continue to invest in both large and small organic growth projects in 2019 and currently estimate that we will invest at least $2.3 billion in organic growth capital expenditures for announced projects in 2019.

Recent Developments
 
Gathering and Processing Segment Expansion
 
Permian Midland Processing Expansions
 
In response to increasing production and to meet the infrastructure needs of producers, we have announced the construction of additional processing plants that further expand the gathering and processing footprint of our Permian Midland systems. These plants were announced in, or completed in, 2018:

• | In February 2018, we announced plans to construct two new cryogenic natural gas processing plants, each with a processing capacity of 250 MMcf/d. The first plant, known as the Hopson Plant, is expected to begin operations early in the second quarter of 2019. The second plant, known as the Pembrook Plant, is expected to begin operations late in the second quarter of 2019.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In May 2017, we announced plans to build a 200 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant, known as the Johnson Plant, which began operations in September 2018.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In November 2016, we announced plans to build the 200 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant, known as the Joyce Plant, which began operations in March 2018.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permian Delaware Processing Expansions
 In March 2018, we announced that we entered into long-term fee-based agreements with an investment grade energy company for natural gas gathering and processing services in the Delaware Basin and for downstream transportation, fractionation and other related services. The agreements are underpinned by the customer's dedication of significant acreage within a large, well-defined area in the Delaware Basin. We are constructing approximately 220 miles of 12- to 24-inch high-pressure rich gas gathering pipelines across the Delaware Basin and a new 250 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant (the “Falcon Plant”) in the Delaware Basin that is expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2019. We have also commenced acquiring long lead time items and have begun site preparation for a second 250 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant (the “Peregrine Plant”) in the Delaware Basin that is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2020.
 
We will provide NGL transportation services on Grand Prix and fractionation services at our Mont Belvieu complex for a majority of the NGLs from the Falcon and Peregrine Plants. Total growth capital expenditures related to the plants and high-pressure pipeline system are expected to be approximately $500 million.
 In May 2017, we announced plans to build a new plant and further expand the gathering footprint of our Permian Delaware systems. This project included a new 250 MMcf/d cryogenic processing plant, known as the Wildcat Plant, which began operations in May 2018. In addition, a 60 MMcf/d cryogenic processing plant, known as the Oahu Plant, was placed into service in April 2018.
 
Badlands
 
In January 2018, we announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture with Hess Midstream Partners LP under which Targa will construct and operate a new 200 MMcf/d natural gas processing plant (the “LM4 Plant”) at Targa’s existing Little Missouri facility. The LM4 Plant is anticipated to be completed in the second quarter of 2019. 
 
SouthOK Expansion
 
In May 2017, we acquired a 150 MMcf/d natural gas processing plant (the “Flag City Plant”) located in Jackson County, Texas, from subsidiaries of Boardwalk Midstream LLC. In December 2017, ownership of the Flag City Plant assets was transferred to Centrahoma Processing, LLC, a joint venture that we operate (“Centrahoma” or the “Centrahoma Joint Venture”), and in which we have a 60% ownership interest; the remaining 40% ownership interest is held by MPLX LP (“MPLX”). The former Flag City Plant assets have been relocated to, and installed in, Hughes County, Oklahoma, as a new 150 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant (the “Hickory Hills Plant”). The Hickory Hills Plant processes natural gas production from the Arkoma Woodford Basin and began operations in December 2018. In October 2018, Targa contributed the 120 MMcf/d cryogenic Tupelo Plant in Coal County, Oklahoma to Centrahoma. In conjunction with Targa’s contribution of both the Hickory Hills and Tupelo plant assets, MPLX made cash contributions to Centrahoma in order to maintain its 40% ownership interest in the expanded operations.

Eagle Ford Shale Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Joint Venture
 
In May 2018, Sanchez Midstream Partners LP (“Sanchez Midstream”) and we merged our respective 50% interests in the Carnero gathering and Carnero processing joint ventures, which own the high-pressure Carnero gathering line and Raptor natural gas processing plant, to form an expanded 50/50 joint venture in South Texas (the “Carnero Joint Venture”) that we operate. In connection with the joint venture merger transactions, the Carnero Joint Venture acquired our 200 MMcf/d Silver Oak II natural gas processing plant located in Bee County, Texas, which increased the processing capacity of the joint venture from 260 MMcf/d to 460 MMcf/d. Additional enhancements to the prior joint ventures included dedication of over 315,000 additional gross acres in the Western Eagle Ford, operated by Sanchez Energy Corporation (“Sanchez Energy” or “SN”), under a new long-term firm gas gathering and processing agreement. Including the initial dedication of approximately 105,000 gross acres (the “Catarina acreage”), the joint venture now has over 420,000 gross acres under a long-term dedication.
Downstream Segment Expansion
 
Grand Prix NGL Pipeline
 
In May 2017, we announced plans to construct a new common carrier NGL pipeline. The pipeline will transport NGLs from the Permian Basin and North Texas to our fractionation and storage complex in the NGL market hub at Mont Belvieu, Texas. Grand Prix will be supported by our volumes and other third-party customer volume commitments, and is expected to be fully in service in the third quarter of 2019.
 
In September 2017, we sold a 25% interest in our consolidated subsidiary, Grand Prix Pipeline LLC (the "Grand Prix Joint Venture"), which owns the portion of Grand Prix extending from the Permian Basin to Mont Belvieu, Texas, to funds managed by Blackstone Energy Partners (“Blackstone”). We are the operator and construction manager of Grand Prix.
 
Concurrent with the sale of the minority interest in the Grand Prix Joint Venture to Blackstone, we and EagleClaw Midstream Ventures, LLC ("EagleClaw"), a Blackstone portfolio company, executed a long-term Raw Product Purchase Agreement whereby EagleClaw dedicated and committed significant NGLs associated with EagleClaw's natural gas volumes produced or processed in the Delaware Basin.
 
Grand Prix NGL Pipeline Extension into Oklahoma
 In March 2018, we announced an extension of Grand Prix into southern Oklahoma. The pipeline expansion is supported by long-term commitments of NGLs for both transportation and fractionation from our existing and future processing plants in the Arkoma area in our SouthOK system and from third-party commitments, including a long-term commitment of NGLs for transportation and fractionation with Valiant Midstream, LLC. The extension of Grand Prix into southern Oklahoma is not part of the Grand Prix Joint Venture. 
 The capacity of the 24-inch diameter pipeline segment from the Permian Basin will be approximately 300 MBbl/d, expandable to 550 MBbl/d. The pipeline segment from the Permian Basin will be connected to a 30-inch diameter pipeline segment in North Texas where Permian, North Texas and Oklahoma volumes will be connected to Mont Belvieu, and will have capacity of approximately 450 MBbl/d, expandable to 950 MBbl/d. The capacity from Oklahoma to North Texas will vary based on telescoping pipe size.
 
In February 2019, we announced an extension of Grand Prix from southern Oklahoma to the STACK region of Central Oklahoma where it will connect with Williams’ new Bluestem Pipeline and link the Conway, Kansas, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, NGL markets. In connection with this project, Williams has committed significant volumes to us that we will transport on Grand Prix and fractionate at our Mont Belvieu facilities. Williams will also have an initial option to purchase a 20% equity interest in one of our recently announced fractionation trains (Train 7 or Train 8) in Mont Belvieu. This Grand Prix extension is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021.
 
Grand Prix volumes flowing on the pipeline from the Permian Basin to Mont Belvieu are included in the Blackstone and Grand Prix DevCo (as defined below) joint venture arrangements, while the volumes flowing from North Texas and Oklahoma to Mont Belvieu accrue solely to Targa’s benefit.
 
Total growth capital spending on Grand Prix, including the extensions into Oklahoma, is now estimated to be approximately $1.9 billion, with our portion of growth capital spending estimated to be approximately $1.3 billion.

Fractionation Expansion
 
In February 2018, we announced plans to construct a new 100 MBbl/d fractionation train in Mont Belvieu, Texas (“Train 6”), which is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2019. The total cost of the fractionation train and related infrastructure is expected to be approximately $350 million.
 
In November 2018, we announced plans to construct two new 110 MBbl/d fractionation trains in Mont Belvieu, Texas (“Train 7 and Train 8”), which are expected to begin operations in the first quarter of 2020 and second quarter of 2020, respectively. The total cost of these fractionation trains and related infrastructure is expected to be approximately $825 million.
 
LPG Export Expansion
 
In February 2019, we announced plans to further expand our LPG export capabilities of propane and butanes at our Galena Park Marine Terminal by increasing refrigeration capacity and load rates. Our current effective export capacity of 7 MMBbl per month will increase to approximately 11 to 15 MMBbl per month, depending upon the mix of propane and butane demand, vessel size and availability of supply, among other factors. The total cost of the expansion and related infrastructure is expected to be approximately $120 million and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2020.
Gulf Coast Express Pipeline
 In December 2017, we entered into definitive joint venture agreements with Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline LLC (“KMTP”) and DCP Midstream Partners, LP (“DCP”) with respect to the joint development of the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline, a natural gas pipeline from the Waha hub, including direct connections to the tailgate of many of our Midland Basin processing facilities, 
to Agua Dulce in South Texas. The pipeline will provide an outlet for increased natural gas production from the Permian Basin to growing markets along the Texas Gulf Coast. We and DCP each own a 25% interest 
and KMTP owns a 35% interest in GCX. In December 2018, Altus Midstream Company exercised their option to purchase the remaining 15% interest, which was originally held by KMTP. KMTP will serve as the construction manager and operator of GCX
. We have committed significant volumes to GCX. In addition, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (“Pioneer”), a joint owner in our WestTX Permian Basin assets, has committed volumes to the project. GCX is designed to transport up to 1.98 Bcf/d of natural gas and the total cost of the project is estimated to be approximately $1.75 billion. GCX is expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2019, pending regulatory approvals.
 
Development Joint Ventures
 
In February 2018, we also announced the formation of three development joint ventures (the “DevCo JVs”) with investment vehicles affiliated with Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners (“Stonepeak”). Stonepeak owns an 80% interest in both the GCX DevCo JV, which owns our 25% interest in GCX, and the Train 6 DevCo JV, which owns a 100% interest in certain assets associated with Train 6. Stonepeak owns a 95% interest in the Grand Prix DevCo JV, which owns a 20% interest in the Grand Prix Joint Venture. We hold the remaining interest of each DevCo JV, as well as control the management, construction and operation of Grand Prix and the fractionation train. The Train 6 DevCo JV will fund the fractionation train while we will fund 100% of the required brine, storage and other infrastructure that will support the fractionation train’s operations.
 
Stonepeak committed a maximum of approximately $960 million of capital to the DevCo JVs, including an initial contribution of approximately $190 million that was distributed to the Partnership to reimburse it for a portion of capital spent to date.
 
For a four-year period beginning on the earlier of the date that all three projects have commenced commercial operations or January 1, 2020, we have the option to acquire all or part of Stonepeak’s interests in the DevCo JVs. We may acquire up to 50% of Stonepeak’s invested capital in multiple increments with a minimum of $100 million, and Stonepeak’s remaining 50% interest in a single final purchase. The purchase price payable for such partial or full interests would be based on a predetermined fixed return or multiple on invested capital, including distributions received by Stonepeak from the DevCo JVs.

Channelview Splitter
 
On December 27, 2015, we and Noble Americas Corp., then an affiliate of Noble Group Ltd., entered into a long-term, fee-based agreement (the “Splitter Agreement”) under which we would
 build and operate a 35,000 Bbl/d crude oil and condensate splitter at our Channelview Terminal on the Houston Ship Channel (the “Channelview Splitter”). In January 2018, Vitol US Holding Co. (“Vitol”) acquired Noble Americas Corp. In December 2018, Vitol elected to terminate the Splitter Agreement. 
 
The Channelview Splitter is currently in the process of start-up and commissioning and has an estimated total cost of approximately $160 million. The Channelview Splitter will have the capability to split approximately 35,000 Bbl/d of crude oil and condensate into its various components, including naphtha, distillate, gas oil, kerosene/jet fuel and liquefied petroleum gas and will provide segregated storage for the crude and condensate and each of their 
components. We are working on third-party contracts and commercialization of the Channelview Splitter.
 Asset Sales and Divestitures
 During the second quarter of 2018, we sold our inland marine barge business to a third party for approximately $69 million. We continue to own and operate two ocean-going barges.
 During the third quarter of 2018, we executed agreements to sell our refined products and crude oil storage and terminaling facilities in Tacoma, Washington, and Baltimore, Maryland, to a third party for approximately $165 million. The sale closed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the proceeds were used to repay debt and to fund a portion of our growth capital program.
 In February 2019, we entered into definitive agreements to sell a 45% interest in Targa Badlands LLC, the entity that holds all of our assets in North Dakota, to funds managed by GSO Capital Partners and Blackstone Tactical Opportunities for $1.6 billion. We will continue to be the operator of Targa Badlands LLC and will hold majority governance rights. Future growth capital is expected to be funded on a pro rata basis. Targa Badlands LLC will pay a minimum quarterly distribution to Blackstone and to Targa based on their initial investments, and Blackstone’s capital contributions will have a liquidation preference upon a sale of Targa Badlands LLC. We expect to use the net cash proceeds to pay down debt and for general corporate purposes, including funding our growth capital program. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019 and is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions.
 
Financing Activities
 
In April 2018, the Partnership issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5⅞% senior notes due 2026 (the “5⅞% Senior Notes due 2026”). The Partnership used the net proceeds of $991.9 million after costs from this offering to repay borrowings under its credit facilities and for general partnership purposes.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 6,315,711 shares of common stock under the equity distribution agreement under the universal shelf registration statement filed in May 2016 (the “December 2016 EDA”), resulting in net proceeds of $318.6 million, and 7,527,902 shares of common stock under the equity distribution agreement under the universal shelf registration statement filed in May 2016 (the “May 2017 EDA”), receiving net proceeds of $364.9 million. In September 2018, we terminated the December 2016 EDA.
 
On September 20, 2018, we entered into an equity distribution agreement under the universal shelf registration a statement filed in May 2016 (the “September 2018 EDA”), pursuant to which we may sell through our sales agents, at our option, up to an aggregate amount of $750.0 million of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2018, no shares of common stock were issued under the September 2018 EDA.
 
On October 29, 2018, Standard & Poor’s Corporation (“S&P”) raised Targa’s corporate credit rating and its issue-level rating on senior unsecured notes to 'BB' from 'BB-’ and raised the outlook to positive from stable.
 
On December 7, 2018, we amended and extended the Partnership’s accounts receivable securitization facility (the “Securitization Facility”) to increase the facility size from $350.0 million to $400.0 million with a termination date of December 6, 2019.
 
In January 2019, the Partnership issued $750.0 million of 6½% Senior Notes due July 2027 and $750.0 million of 6⅞% Senior Notes due January 2029, resulting in total net proceeds of $1,488.8 million. The net proceeds from the offerings were used to redeem in full the Partnership’s outstanding senior notes due 2019 and the remainder is expected to be used for general partnership purposes, which 
 9


may include repaying borrowings under its credit facilities or other indebtedness, funding growth investments and acquisitions, and working capital.
 
TRC Revolver Amendment
 
In June 2018, we entered into an agreement to amend the TRC Revolver to extend the maturity date from February 2020 to June 2023. The available commitments of $670.0 million and our ability to request additional commitments of $200.0 million remained unchanged. The TRC Revolver continues to bear interest costs that are dependent on the ratio of non-Partnership consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the TRC Revolver, and the covenants remained substantially the same.
TRP Revolver Amendment
 
In June 2018, the Partnership entered into an agreement to amend and restate the TRP Revolver, which extended the maturity date from October 2020 to June 2023, increased available commitments from $1.6 billion to $2.2 billion and lowered the applicable margin range and commitment fee range used in the calculation of interest. The Partnership’s ability to request additional commitments of $500.0 million remained unchanged.
 The TRP Revolver bears interest, at the Partnership’s option, either at the base rate or the Eurodollar rate. The base rate is equal to the highest of: (i) Bank of America’s prime rate; (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%; or (iii) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin (a) before the collateral release date, ranging from 0.25% to 1.25% dependent on the Partnership’s ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and (b) upon and after the collateral release date, ranging from 0.125% to 0.75% dependent on the Partnership’s non-credit-enhanced senior unsecured long-term debt ratings. The Eurodollar rate is equal to LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin (i) before the collateral release date, ranging from 1.25% to 2.25% dependent on the Partnership’s ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and (ii) upon and after the collateral release date, ranging from 1.125% to 1.75% dependent on the Partnership’s non-credit-enhanced senior unsecured long-term debt ratings. The TRP Revolver also provides for the release of collateral and a concurrent reduction in loan and commitment fee margins should TRP achieve certain credit ratings.
 The Partnership is required to pay a commitment fee equal to an applicable rate ranging from (a) before the collateral release date, 0.25% to 0.375% (dependent on the Partnership’s ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA) and (b) upon and after the collateral release date, 0.125% to 0.35% (dependent on the Partnership’s non-credit-enhanced senior unsecured long-term debt ratings) times the actual daily average unused portion of the TRP Revolver. Additionally, issued and undrawn letters of credit bear interest at an applicable margin (i) before the collateral release date, ranging from 1.25% to 2.25% dependent on the Partnership’s ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and (ii) upon and after the collateral release date, ranging from 1.125% to 1.75% dependent on the Partnership’s non-credit-enhanced senior unsecured long-term debt ratings. The TRP Revolver’s covenants remained substantially the same.
 Organization Structure
 On February 17, 2016, TRC completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding common units of Targa Resources Partners LP (NYSE: NGLS), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “TRC/TRP Merger Agreement,” and such transaction, the “TRC/TRP Merger”). We issued 104,525,775 shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding common units of the Partnership that we previously did not own. As a result of the completion of the TRC/TRP Merger, the TRP common units are no longer publicly traded. The Partnership’s 9.00% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (the “Preferred Units”) that were issued in October 2015 remain outstanding as preferred limited partner interests in TRP and continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “NGLS PRA.” TRC also maintains a 2% general partner interest in the Partnership.
 On October 19, 2016, TRP executed the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the “Third A&R Partnership Agreement”), effective as of December 1, 2016. In connection with the Third A&R Partnership Agreement, TRP issued to Targa Resources GP LLC (the “General Partner”): (i) 20,380,286 common units and 424,590 General Partner units in exchange for the cancellation of the incentive distribution rights (“IDRs”) and (ii) 11,267,485 common units and 234,739 General Partner units in exchange for cancellation of the Special GP Interest. The Partnership Agreement with us governs our relationship regarding certain reimbursement and indemnification matters. See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence.”

----+---------------------------------------------------

Growth Drivers
 We believe that our near-term growth will be driven by organic projects being placed into service, as well as the level of producer activity in the basins where our gathering and processing infrastructure is located and the level of demand for services provided by our Downstream Business. We believe our assets are not easily duplicated and are located in many attractive and active areas of exploration and production activity and are near key markets and logistics centers. Over the longer term, we expect our growth will continue to be driven by the strong position of our quality assets which will benefit from production from shale plays and by the deployment of shale exploration and production technologies in both liquids-rich natural gas and crude oil resource plays that will also provide additional opportunities for our Downstream Business. We expect that organic growth and third-party acquisitions will continue to be a focus of our growth strategy.
Attractive Asset Positions
 We believe that our positioning in some of the most attractive basins will allow us to capture increased natural gas supplies for gathering and processing, increased NGLs for transportation and fractionation and increased crude oil supplies for gathering and terminaling. Producers continue to focus drilling activity on their most attractive acreage, especially in the Permian Basin where we have a large and well positioned footprint, and are benefiting from increasing activity as rigs have been added in the basin in and around our systems.
 The development of shale and unconventional resource plays has resulted in increasing NGL supplies that continue to generate demand for our fractionation services at the Mont Belvieu market hub and for LPG export services at our Galena Park Marine Terminal on the Houston Ship Channel. Since 2010, in response to increasing demand we added 278 MBbl/d of additional fractionation capacity with the additions of Cedar Bayou Fractionator (“CBF”) Trains 3, 4 and 5, and have additional capacity of 320 MBbl/d under construction. Trains 6, 7 and 8 are expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2019, first quarter of 2020 and second quarter of 2020, respectively. We believe that the higher volumes of fractionated NGLs will also result in increased demand for other related fee-based services provided by our Downstream Business. Continued demand for fractionation capacity is expected to lead to other future growth opportunities.
 11


As domestic producers have focused their drilling in crude oil and liquids-rich areas, new gas processing facilities are being built to accommodate liquids-rich gas, which results in an increasing supply of NGLs. As drilling in these areas continues, the supply of NGLs requiring transportation and fractionation to market hubs is expected to continue. As the supply of NGLs increases, our integrated Mont Belvieu and Galena Park Marine Terminal assets allow us to provide the raw product, fractionation, storage, interconnected terminaling, refrigeration and ship loading capabilities to support exports by third-party customers. Grand Prix will transport volumes from the Permian Basin and our North Texas and southern Oklahoma systems to our fractionation and storage complex in the NGL market hub at Mont Belvieu, Texas, further enhancing the integration of our gathering and processing assets with our Downstream Business.  Grand Prix positions us to offer an integrated midstream service across the NGL value chain to our customers by linking supply to key markets. Grand Prix is expected to be fully in service in the third quarter of 2019.
 Drilling and production activity from liquids-rich natural gas shale plays and similar crude oil resource plays
 We are actively pursuing natural gas gathering and processing and NGL fractionation opportunities associated with liquids-rich natural gas from shale and other resource plays and are also actively pursuing crude gathering and natural gas gathering and processing and NGL fractionation opportunities from active crude oil resource plays. We believe that our leadership position in the Downstream Business, which includes our fractionation and export services and will be complemented by Grand Prix, provides us with a competitive advantage relative to other midstream companies without these capabilities.
 Organic growth and third-party acquisitions
 We have a demonstrated track record of completing organic growth and third-party acquisitions. Since our initial public offering in 2010, we have executed on approximately $8.3 billion of growth capital projects and approximately $7.2 billion in third-party acquisitions. We expect to continue to grow both organically and through third-party acquisitions.
 Competitive Strengths and Strategies
 We believe that we are well positioned to execute our business strategies due to the following competitive strengths:
 Strategically located gathering and processing asset base
 Our gathering and processing businesses are strategically located in attractive oil and gas producing basins and are well positioned within each of those basins. Activity in the shale resource plays underlying our gathering assets is driven by the economics of oil, condensate, gas and NGL production from the particular reservoirs in each play. Activity levels for most of our gathering and processing assets are driven primarily by commodity prices. If drilling and production activities in these areas continue, the volumes of natural gas and crude oil available to our gathering and processing systems will likely increase.
 Leading fractionation, LPG export and NGL infrastructure position
 We are one of the largest fractionators of NGLs in the Gulf Coast. Our fractionation assets are primarily located in Mont Belvieu, Texas, and to a lesser extent Lake Charles, Louisiana, which are key market centers for NGLs. Our logistics operations at Mont Belvieu, the major U.S. hub of NGL infrastructure, include connections to a number of mixed NGL (“mixed NGLs” or “Y-grade”) supply pipelines, storage, interconnection and takeaway pipelines and other transportation infrastructure. Our logistics assets, including fractionation facilities, storage wells, low ethane propane de-ethanizer, and our Galena Park Marine Terminal and related pipeline systems and interconnects, are also located near and connected to key consumers of NGL products including the petrochemical and industrial markets. Once in service, Grand Prix will connect the very active Permian Basin to Mont Belvieu. The location and interconnectivity of these assets are not easily replicated, and we have additional capability to expand their capacity. We have extensive experience in operating these assets and developing, permitting and constructing new midstream assets.
 Comprehensive package of midstream services
 We provide a comprehensive package of services to natural gas and crude oil producers. These services are essential to gather crude; gather, process and treat wellhead gas to meet pipeline standards; and extract, transport and fractionate NGLs for sale into petrochemical, industrial, commercial and export markets. We believe that our ability to offer these integrated services provides us with an advantage in competing for new supplies because we can provide substantially all of the services that producers, marketers and others require for moving natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from wellhead to market on a cost-effective basis. Both Grand Prix and GCX further enhance our position to offer an integrated midstream service across the natural gas and NGL value chain by linking supply to key markets. Additionally, we believe the barriers to enter the midstream sector on a scale similar to ours are reasonably high due to the high cost of replicating or acquiring assets in key strategic positions and the difficulty of developing the expertise necessary to operate them.

High quality and efficient assets
 Our gathering and processing systems and logistics assets consist of high-quality, well-maintained facilities, resulting in low-cost, efficient operations. Advanced technologies have been implemented for processing plants (primarily cryogenic units utilizing centralized control systems), measurement systems (essentially all electronic and electronically linked to a central data-base) and operations and maintenance management systems to manage work orders and implement preventative maintenance schedules (computerized maintenance management systems). These applications have allowed proactive management of our operations resulting in lower costs and minimal downtime. We have established a reputation in the midstream industry as a reliable and cost-effective supplier of services to our customers and have a track record of safe, efficient, and reliable operation of our facilities. We will continue to pursue new contracts, cost efficiencies and operating improvements of our assets. Such improvements in the past have included new production and acreage commitments, reducing fuel gas and flare volumes and improving facility capacity and NGL recoveries. We will also continue to optimize existing plant assets to improve and maximize capacity and throughput. 
 In addition to routine annual maintenance expenses, our maintenance capital expenditures have averaged approximately $107 million per year over the last three years. We believe that our assets are well-maintained and anticipate that a similar level of maintenance capital expenditures will be sufficient for us to continue to operate our existing assets in a prudent, safe and cost-effective manner.
 Large, diverse business mix with favorable contracts and increasing fee-based business
 We maintain gas gathering and processing positions in strategic oil and gas producing areas across multiple basins and provide these and other services under attractive contract terms to a diverse mix of producers across our areas of operation. Consequently, we are not dependent on any one oil and gas basin or counterparty. Our Logistics and Marketing assets are typically located near key market hubs and near most of our NGL customers. They also serve must-run portions of the natural gas value chain, are primarily fee-based and have a diverse mix of customers.
 Our contract portfolio has attractive rate and term characteristics including a significant fee-based component, especially in our Downstream Business. Our expected continued growth of the fee-based Downstream Business may result in increasing fee-based cash flow. The Permian Acquisition resulted in increased fee-based cash flow as the entities acquired have primarily fee-based gathering and processing contracts.
 Financial flexibility
 We have historically maintained sufficient liquidity and have funded our growth investments with a mix of equity and debt over time in order to manage our leverage ratio. Disciplined management of liquidity, leverage and commodity price volatility allow us to be flexible in our long-term growth strategy and enable us to pursue strategic acquisitions and large growth projects.
 Experienced and long-term focused management team
 Our current executive management team possesses breadth and depth of experience working in the midstream energy business. Most of our executive management team has been with us since the company was formed in 2005, joined shortly thereafter or managed many of our businesses prior to acquisition by Targa. Other officers and key operational, commercial and financial employees have significant experience in the industry and with our assets and businesses.
 Attractive cash flow characteristics
 We believe that our strategy, combined with our high-quality asset portfolio, allows us to generate attractive cash flows. Geographic, business and customer diversity enhances our cash flow profile. Our Gathering and Processing segment has a contract mix that is primarily percent-of-proceeds (whereby we receive an agreed upon percentage of the actual proceeds of specified commodities). However, our Gathering and Processing segment contract mix also has increasing components of fee-based margin driven by: (i) fees added to percent-of-proceeds contracts for natural gas treating and compression, (ii) new/amended contracts with a combination of percent-of-proceeds and fee-based components, and (iii) essentially fully fee-based crude oil gathering and gas gathering and processing in certain areas where fee-based contracts are prevalent such as the Williston Basin, South Oklahoma, South Texas and parts of the Permian Basin. Contracts in our Coastal Gathering and Processing segment are primarily hybrid contracts (percent-of-liquids with a fee floor) or percent-of-liquids contracts (whereby we receive an agreed upon percentage of the actual proceeds of the NGLs). Contracts in the Downstream Business are predominately fee-based (based on volumes and contracted rates), with a large take-or-pay component. Our contract mix, along with our commodity hedging program, serves to mitigate the impact of commodity price movements on cash flow. 
 13


We have hedged the commodity price risk associated with a portion of our expected natural gas, NGL and condensate equity volumes, future commodity purchases and sales, and transportation basis risk by entering into financially settled derivative transactions. These transactions include swaps, futures, purchased puts (or floors) and costless collars. The primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to price risk and to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices on cash flow. We have intentionally tailored our hedges to approximate specific NGL products and to approximate our actual NGL and residue natural gas delivery points. Although the degree of hedging will vary, we intend to continue to manage some of our exposure to commodity prices by entering into similar hedge transactions. We also monitor and manage our inventory levels with a view to mitigate losses related to downward price exposure.
 Asset base well-positioned for organic growth
 We believe that our asset platform and strategic locations allow us to maintain and potentially grow our volumes and related cash flows as our supply areas benefit from continued exploration and development over time. Technology advances have resulted in increased domestic oil and liquids-rich gas drilling and production activity. The location of our assets provides us with access to natural gas and crude oil supplies and proximity to end-user markets and liquid market hubs while positioning us to capitalize on drilling and production activity in those areas. We believe that as global supply and demand for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, and services for each grows over the long term, our infrastructure will increase in value as such infrastructure takes on increasing importance in meeting that growing supply and demand.
 While we have set forth our strategies and competitive strengths above, our business involves numerous risks and uncertainties which may prevent us from executing our strategies. These risks include the adverse impact of changes in natural gas, NGL and condensate/crude oil prices, the supply of or demand for these commodities, and our inability to access sufficient additional production to replace natural declines in production. For a more complete description of the risks associated with an investment in us, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
 

Our Business Operations
 
Our operations are reported in two segments: (i) Gathering and Processing, and (ii) Logistics and Marketing (also referred to as the Downstream Business).

Gathering and Processing Segment
 Our Gathering and Processing segment consists of gathering, compressing, dehydrating, treating, conditioning, processing, and marketing natural gas and gathering crude oil. The gathering of natural gas consists of aggregating natural gas produced from various wells through varying diameter gathering lines to processing plants. Natural gas has a widely varying composition depending on the field, the formation and the reservoir from which it is produced. The processing of natural gas consists of the extraction of imbedded NGLs and the removal of water vapor and other contaminants to form (i) a stream of marketable natural gas, commonly referred to as residue gas, and (ii) a stream of mixed NGLs. Once processed, the residue gas is transported to markets through pipelines that are owned by third parties. End-users of residue gas include large commercial and industrial customers, as well as natural gas and electric utilities serving individual consumers. We sell our residue gas either directly to such end-users or to marketers into intrastate or interstate pipelines, which are typically located in close proximity or with ready access to our facilities. The gathering of crude oil consists of aggregating crude oil production primarily through gathering pipeline systems, which deliver crude oil to a combination of other pipelines, rail and truck.
 We continually seek new supplies of natural gas and crude oil, both to offset the natural decline in production from connected wells and to increase throughput volumes. We obtain additional natural gas and crude oil supply in our operating areas by contracting for production from new wells or by capturing existing production currently gathered by others. Competition for new natural gas and crude oil supplies is based primarily on location of assets, commercial terms including pre-existing contracts, service levels and access to markets. The commercial terms of natural gas gathering and processing arrangements and crude oil gathering are driven, in part, by capital costs, which are impacted by the proximity of systems to the supply source and by operating costs, which are impacted by operational efficiencies, facility design and economies of scale. 
 The Gathering and Processing segment's assets are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeast New Mexico (including the Midland, Central and Delaware Basins); the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; the Barnett Shale in North Texas; the Anadarko, Ardmore, and Arkoma Basins in Oklahoma (including the SCOOP and STACK) and South Central Kansas; the Williston Basin in North Dakota; and the onshore and near offshore regions of the Louisiana Gulf Coast and the Gulf of Mexico.

The natural gas processed in this segment is supplied through our gathering systems which, in aggregate, consist of approximately 28,500 miles of natural gas pipelines and include 42 owned and operated processing plants. During 2018, we processed an average of 3,937.4 MMcf/d of natural gas and produced an average of 415.7 MBbl/d of NGLs. In addition to our natural gas gathering and processing, our Badlands operations include a crude oil gathering system and four terminals with crude oil operational storage capacity of 125 MBbl, and our Permian operations include a crude oil gathering system and two terminals with crude oil operational storage capacity of 20 MBbl. During 2018, we gathered an average of 211.7 MBbl/d of crude oil.
 The Gathering and Processing segment’s operations consist of Permian Midland, Permian Delaware, SouthTX, North Texas, SouthOK, WestOK, Coastal and Badlands each as described below:

The Saunders, Eunice and Monument refrigerated cryogenic processing plants have aggregate processing capacity of 255 MMcf/d. Gathered volumes from the Versado area may also be processed at the Wildcat or Oahu processing facilities.
 The Permian Midland and Permian Delaware systems are interconnected and volumes may flow from one system to the other.
 
SouthTX
 The South Texas system contains approximately 900 miles of high-pressure and low-pressure gathering and transmission pipelines and three natural
 gas processing plants in the Eagle Ford Shale.  The South Texas system processes natural gas through the Silver Oak I, Silver Oak II and Raptor gas processing plants. The Silver Oak I and II Plants (the “Silver Oak Plants”) are each 200 MMcf/d cryogenic plants and located in Bee County, Texas. The Raptor Plant is a 260 MMcf/d cryogenic plant located in LaSalle County, Texas. 
 We participate in three joint ventures in South Texas. Our ownership interests in two of the joint ventures consist of our 75% share in T2 LaSalle Gathering Company LLC (“T2 LaSalle”) and our 50% share in T2 Eagle Ford Gathering Company LLC (“T2 Eagle Ford”). A subsidiary of Southcross Holdings, L.P. (“Southcross”) owns the remaining interests. T2 LaSalle owns approximately 60 miles of high-pressure gathering pipeline and T2 Eagle Ford owns approximately 120 miles of high-pressure gathering pipelines. Together, these two pipelines gather and transport gas to the Silver Oak Plants. The T2 Eagle Ford joint venture also owns the residue gas delivery pipelines downstream of the Silver Oak Plants. Effective December 31, 2018, we were named as operator for each of T2 LaSalle and T2 Eagle Ford.
 15


Our third joint venture in South Texas is with Sanchez Midstream.  We own a 50% interest in the Carnero Joint Venture and Sanchez Midstream owns the remaining 50% interest. Carnero owns the Silver Oak II Plant, the Raptor Plant and approximately 45 miles of high-pressure transmission pipeline located in La Salle, Dimmitt and Webb Counties, Texas which connects Sanchez Energy’s Catarina Ranch gathering system and Comanche Ranch acreage to the Raptor Plant. We operate the Carnero gas gathering and processing facilities.
 
North Texas 
 North Texas includes two interconnected gathering systems in the Fort Worth Basin, Chico and Shackelford, and includes gas from the Barnett Shale and Marble Falls plays. The systems consist of approximately 4,700 miles of pipelines gathering wellhead natural gas.
 The Chico gathering system gathers natural gas for the Chico and Longhorn plants. The Chico Plant has an aggregate processing capacity of 265 MMcf/d and an integrated fractionation capacity of 15 MBbl/d. The Longhorn Plant has processing capacity of 200 MMcf/d. The Shackelford gathering system gathers wellhead natural gas largely for the Shackelford Plant.

Coastal
 
Our Coastal assets, located in and offshore South Louisiana, gather and process natural gas produced from shallow-water central and western Gulf of Mexico natural gas wells and from deep shelf and deep-water Gulf of Mexico production via connections to third-party pipelines or through pipelines owned by us. Coastal consists of approximately 3,295 MMcf/d of natural gas processing capacity, 11 MBbl/d of integrated fractionation capacity, 980 miles of onshore gathering system pipelines, and 170 miles of offshore gathering system pipelines. The processing plants are comprised of five wholly-owned and operated plants (including one idled), one partially owned and operated plant, and two partially owned plants which are not operated by us. Toca, a partially owned, non-operated plant, was shut down in January 2019 and has been excluded from the preceding statistics. Our Coastal plants have access to markets across the U.S. through the interstate natural gas pipelines to which they are interconnected. The industry continues to rationalize gas processing capacity along the western Louisiana Gulf Coast with most of the producer volumes going to more efficient plants such as our Barracuda and Gillis plants.
Badlands
 The Badlands operations are located in the Bakken and Three Forks Shale plays of the Williston Basin in North Dakota and include approximately 480 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines, 40 MBbl of operational crude oil storage capacity at the Johnsons Corner Terminal, 30 MBbl of operational crude oil storage capacity at the Alexander Terminal, 30 MBbl of operational crude oil storage at New Town and 25 MBbl of operational crude oil storage at Stanley. The Badlands assets also include approximately 260 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines and the Little Missouri natural gas processing plant with a current gross processing capacity of approximately 90 MMcf/d. Additionally, the 200 MMcf/d LM4 Plant, in which we own a 50% interest and will operate, is anticipated to be completed in the second quarter of 2019. Hess Midstream Partners LP owns the remaining interest in the LM4 Plant.
 In February 2019, we entered into definitive agreements to sell a 45% interest in Badlands to funds managed by GSO Capital Partners and Blackstone Tactical Opportunities. Targa will continue to be the operator of Badlands and will hold majority governance rights.

Logistics and Marketing Segment
 Our Logistics and Marketing segment is also referred to as our Downstream Business. Our Downstream Business includes the activities and assets necessary to convert mixed NGLs into NGL products and also includes other assets and value-added services described below. The Logistics and Marketing segment includes Grand Prix, as well as our equity interest in GCX, which are both currently under construction. The associated assets, including these pipeline projects, are generally connected to and supplied in part by our Gathering and Processing segment and, except for the pipeline projects and smaller terminals, are located predominantly in Mont Belvieu and Galena Park, Texas, and in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Our fractionation, pipeline transportation, storage and terminaling businesses include approximately 1,100 miles of company-owned pipelines to transport mixed NGLs and specification products.
 The Logistics and Marketing segment also transports, distributes and markets NGLs via terminals and transportation assets across the U.S. We own or commercially manage terminal facilities in a number of states, including Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arizona, Nevada, California, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky and New Jersey. The geographic diversity of our assets provides direct access to many NGL customers as well as markets via trucks, barges, ships, rail cars and open-access regulated NGL pipelines owned by third parties. 
 Additional description of the Logistics and Marketing segment assets and business activities associated with Fractionation, NGL Storage and Terminaling, Petroleum Logistics, NGL Distribution and Marketing, Wholesale Domestic Marketing, Refinery Services, Commercial Transportation and Natural Gas Marketing follows below.

 After being extracted in the field, mixed NGLs are typically transported to a centralized facility for fractionation where the mixed NGLs are separated into discrete NGL products: ethane, ethane-propane mix, propane, normal butane, iso-butane and natural gasoline. 
 Our NGL fractionation business is under fee-based arrangements. These fees are subject to adjustment for changes in certain fractionation expenses, including energy costs. The operating results of our NGL fractionation business are dependent upon the volume of mixed NGLs fractionated, the level of fractionation fees charged and product gains/losses from fractionation.
 We believe that sufficient volumes of mixed NGLs will be available for fractionation in commercially viable quantities for the foreseeable future due to historical increases in NGL production from shale plays and other shale-technology-driven resource plays in areas of the U.S. that include Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and the Rockies and certain other basins accessed by pipelines to Mont Belvieu, as well as from conventional production of NGLs in areas such as the Permian Basin, Mid-Continent, East Texas, South Louisiana and shelf and deep-water Gulf of Mexico. Hydrocarbon dew point specifications implemented by individual natural gas pipelines and the Policy Statement on Provisions Governing Natural Gas Quality and Interchangeability in Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Company Tariffs enacted in 2006 by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) should result in volumes of mixed NGLs being available for fractionation because natural gas requires processing or conditioning to meet pipeline quality specifications. These requirements establish a base volume of mixed NGLs during periods when it might be otherwise uneconomical to process certain sources of natural gas. Furthermore, significant volumes of mixed NGLs are contractually committed to our NGL fractionation facilities.

Although competition for NGL fractionation services is primarily based on the fractionation fee, the ability of an NGL fractionator to obtain mixed NGLs and distribute NGL products is also an important competitive factor. This ability is a function of the existence of storage infrastructure and supply and market connectivity necessary to conduct such operations. We believe that the location, scope and capability of our logistics assets, including our transportation and distribution systems, give us access to both substantial sources of mixed NGLs and a large number of end-use markets.
 
Our fractionation assets include ownership interests in three stand-alone fractionation facilities that are located on the Gulf Coast, two of which we operate, one at Mont Belvieu, Texas and the other at Lake Charles, Louisiana. We have an equity investment in the third fractionation facility, Gulf Coast Fractionators LP (“GCF”), also located at Mont Belvieu. In addition to the three stand-alone facilities in the Logistics Assets segment, we own fractionation assets at Chico, Monument and Gillis in our Gathering and Processing segment.
 
The five existing fractionation trains at the Mont Belvieu facility with a gross capacity of 493.0 MBbl/d are part of our 88%-owned Cedar Bayou Fractionators. Three additional fractionation trains, which are currently under construction at the Mont Belvieu facility, are not part of CBF. The additional fractionation trains will be fully integrated with our existing Gulf Coast NGL storage, terminaling and delivery infrastructure, which includes an extensive network of connections to key petrochemical and industrial customers as well as our LPG export terminal at Galena Park on the Houston Ship Channel. The additional fractionation trains are: (1) the 100 MBbl/d Train 6, which is expected to begin operations in the second quarter 2019, (2) the 110 MBbl/d Train 7, which is expected to begin operations in the first quarter 2020 and (3) the 110 MBbl/d Train 8, which is expected to begin operations in the second quarter 2020. 
 We also have a natural gasoline hydrotreater at Mont Belvieu, Texas that removes sulfur from natural gasoline, allowing customers to meet stringent environmental standards. The facility has a capacity of 35 MBbl/d and is supported by long-term fee-based contracts that have certain guaranteed volume commitments or provisions for deficiency payments.
 The following table details the Logistics and Marketing segment’s fractionation and treating facilities:

----+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
NGL Storage and Terminaling
 In general, our NGL storage assets provide warehousing of mixed NGLs, NGL products and petrochemical products in underground wells, which allows for the injection and withdrawal of such products at various times in order to meet supply and demand cycles. Similarly, our terminaling operations provide the inbound/outbound logistics and warehousing of mixed NGLs, NGL products and petrochemical products in above-ground storage tanks. Our NGL underground storage and terminaling facilities serve single markets, such as propane, as well as multiple products and markets. For example, the Mont Belvieu and Galena Park facilities have extensive pipeline connections for mixed NGL supply and delivery of component NGLs, including Grand Prix once it is operational. In addition, some of our facilities are connected to marine, rail and truck loading and unloading facilities that provide services and products to our customers. We provide long and short-term storage and terminaling services and throughput capability to third-party customers for a fee.
 Across the Logistics and Marketing segment, we own 34 storage wells at our facilities with a gross storage capacity of approximately 71 MMBbl, and operate 6 non-owned wells, the usage of which may be limited by brine handling capacity, which is utilized to displace NGLs from storage.
 20


We operate our storage and terminaling facilities to support our key fractionation facilities at Mont Belvieu and Lake Charles for receipt of mixed NGLs and storage of fractionated NGLs to service the petrochemical, refinery, export and heating customers/markets as well as our wholesale domestic terminals that focus on logistics to service the heating market customer base. Our international export assets include our facilities at both Mont Belvieu and the Galena Park Marine Terminal near Houston, Texas. The facilities have export capacity of approximately 7 MMBbl per month of propane and/or butane with the capability to export international grade low ethane propane. We have the capability to load VLGC vessels, alongside small and medium sized export vessels. We continue to experience demand growth for U.S.-based NGLs (both propane and butane) for export into international markets and have the ability to further enhance our loading capabilities.
 The following table details the Logistics and Marketing segment’s NGL storage and terminaling facilities:
 
 
Facility | % Owned | Location | Description | Throughput for 2018 (MMgal) | | Number of Operational Wells | | Gross Storage Capacity (MMBbl)

Petroleum Logistics
 Our Petroleum Logistics business owns and operates a storage and terminaling facility in Channelview, Texas. This facility serves the refined petroleum products, crude oil, LPG, and petrochemicals markets. The Channelview storage and terminaling facility’s throughput for the year ended December 31, 2018, was 171.6 MMgal and the gross storage capacity was 0.6 MMBbl. The Channelview Splitter, which is currently in the process of start-up and commissioning, will be part of our Petroleum Logistics business once in service. 
 NGL Distribution and Marketing
 We market our own NGL production and also purchase component NGL products from other NGL producers and marketers for resale. Additionally, we also purchase product for resale in our Logistics and Marketing segment, including exports. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our distribution and marketing services business sold an average of 537.9 MBbl/d of NGLs.
 We generally purchase mixed NGLs at a monthly pricing index less applicable fractionation, transportation and marketing fees and resell these component products to petrochemical manufacturers, refineries and other marketing and retail companies. This is primarily a physical settlement business in which we earn margins from purchasing and selling NGL products from customers under contract. We also earn margins by purchasing and reselling NGL products in the spot and forward physical markets. To effectively serve our distribution and marketing customers, we contract for and use many of the assets included in our Logistics and Marketing segment.
 Wholesale Domestic Marketing
 Our wholesale domestic propane marketing operations primarily sell propane and related logistics services to major multi-state retailers, independent retailers and other end-users. Our propane supply primarily originates from both our refinery/gas supply contracts and our other owned or managed logistics and marketing assets. We sell propane at a fixed posted price or at a market index basis at the time of delivery and in some circumstances, we earn margin on a netback basis.
 The wholesale domestic propane marketing business is significantly impacted by seasonal and weather-driven demand, particularly in the winter, which can impact the price and volume of propane sold in the markets we serve.
 21


Refinery Services
 In our refinery services business, we typically provide NGL balancing services via contractual arrangements with refiners to purchase and/or market propane and to supply butanes. We use our commercial transportation assets (discussed below) and contract for and use the storage, transportation and distribution assets included in our Logistics and Marketing segment to assist refinery customers in managing their NGL product demand and production schedules. This includes both feedstocks consumed in refinery processes and the excess NGLs produced by other refining processes. Under typical netback purchase contracts, we generally retain a portion of the resale price of NGL sales or receive a fixed minimum fee per gallon on products sold. Under netback sales contracts, fees are earned for locating and supplying NGL feedstocks to the refineries based on a percentage of the cost to obtain such supply or a minimum fee per gallon.
 Key factors impacting the results of our refinery services business include production volumes, prices of propane and butanes, as well as our ability to perform receipt, delivery and transportation services in order to meet refinery demand.
 Commercial Transportation
 Our NGL transportation and distribution infrastructure includes a wide range of assets supporting both third-party customers and the delivery requirements of our marketing and asset management business. We provide fee-based transportation services to refineries and petrochemical companies throughout the Gulf Coast area. Our assets are also deployed to serve our wholesale domestic distribution terminals, fractionation facilities, underground storage facilities and pipeline injection terminals. These distribution assets provide a variety of ways to transport products to and from our customers.
 Our transportation assets, as of December 31, 2018, include approximately 585 railcars that we lease and manage, approximately 136 leased and managed transport tractors and 2 company-owned pressurized NGL barges.
 The following table details the Logistics and Marketing segment’s raw NGL, propane and butane terminaling facilities:

Natural Gas Marketing
 We also market natural gas available to us from the Gathering and Processing segment, purchase and resell natural gas in selected U.S. markets and manage the scheduling and logistics for these activities.
Seasonality
 
Overall, parts of our business are impacted by seasonality. Our downstream marketing business can be significantly impacted by seasonal and weather-driven demand, which can impact the price and volume of product sold in the markets we serve, as well as the level of inventory we hold in order to meet anticipated demand. See further discussion of the extent to which our business is affected by seasonality in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
 
22


Operational Risks and Insurance
 We are subject to all risks inherent in the midstream natural gas, crude oil and petroleum logistics businesses. These risks include, but are not limited to, explosions, fires, mechanical failure, terrorist attacks, product spillage, weather, nature and inadequate maintenance of rights of way and could result in damage to or destruction of operating assets and other property, or could result in personal injury, loss of life or environmental pollution, as well as curtailment or suspension of operations at the affected facility. We maintain, on behalf of ourselves and our subsidiaries, including the Partnership, general public liability, property, boiler and machinery and business interruption insurance in amounts that we consider to be appropriate for such risks. Such insurance is subject to deductibles that we consider reasonable and not excessive given the current insurance market environment. 
 The occurrence of a significant loss that is not insured, fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure of a party to meet its indemnification obligations, could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition. While we currently maintain levels and types of insurance that we believe to be prudent under current insurance industry market conditions, our inability to secure these levels and types of insurance in the future could negatively impact our business operations and financial stability, particularly if an uninsured loss were to occur. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain these levels of insurance in the future at rates considered commercially reasonable, particularly named windstorm coverage and contingent business interruption coverage for our onshore operations.
 Competition
 We face strong competition in acquiring new natural gas or crude oil supplies. Competition for natural gas and crude oil supplies is primarily based on the location of gathering and processing facilities, pricing arrangements, reputation, efficiency, flexibility, reliability and access to end-use markets or liquid marketing hubs. Competitors to our gathering and processing operations include other natural gas gatherers and processors, such as major interstate and intrastate pipeline companies, master limited partnerships and oil and gas producers. Our major competitors for natural gas supplies in our current operating regions include Enterprise, Kinder Morgan, WTG Gas Processing, L.P. (“WTG”), DCP, Enbridge Inc., Enlink Midstream Partners LP, Energy Transfer, ONEOK, J-W Operating Company, Louisiana Intrastate Gas Company L.L.C., Enable and several other pipeline companies. Our competitors for crude oil gathering services in North Dakota include Crestwood Equity Partners LP, Kinder Morgan, Tesoro Corporation, Caliber Midstream Partners, L.P., Bridger Pipeline LLC, Paradigm Energy Partners, LLC and Summit Midstream Partners, LLC. Our competitors may have greater financial resources than we possess.
 We also compete for NGL supplies for our NGL pipeline currently under construction. Competition for NGL supplies is primarily based on the location of gathering and processing facilities and their connectivity to NGL pipeline takeaway options, access to end-use markets or liquid marketing hubs, pricing and contractual arrangements, reputation, efficiency, flexibility, and reliability. Competitors to our NGL pipeline include other midstream providers with NGL transportation capabilities, such as major interstate and intrastate pipeline companies, master limited partnerships and midstream natural gas and NGL companies. Our major competitors for NGL supplies in our current operating regions include Energy Transfer, Enterprise, ONEOK, 
DCP and EPIC Midstream Holdings LP.
 Additionally, we face competition for mixed NGLs supplies at our fractionation facilities. Our competitors include large oil, natural gas and petrochemical companies. The fractionators in which we own an interest in the Mont Belvieu region compete for volumes of mixed NGLs with other fractionators also located at Mont Belvieu, Texas. Among the primary competitors are Enterprise, ONEOK and LoneStar NGL LLC. In addition, certain producers fractionate mixed NGLs for their own account in captive facilities. The Mont Belvieu fractionators also compete on a more limited basis with fractionators in Conway, Kansas and a number of decentralized, smaller fractionation facilities in Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico. Our other fractionation facilities compete for mixed NGLs with the fractionators at Mont Belvieu as well as other fractionation facilities located in Louisiana. Our customers who are significant producers of mixed NGLs and NGL products or consumers of NGL products may develop their own fractionation facilities in lieu of using our services. Our primary competitors in providing export services to our customers are Enterprise, Phillips 66 and LoneStar NGL LLC.
 We also compete for NGL products to market through our Logistics and Marketing segment. Our competitors include major oil and gas producers who market NGL products for their own account and for others. Additionally, we compete with several other NGL marketing companies, including Enterprise, Energy Transfer, DCP, ONEOK and BP p.l.c.
 Regulation of Operations
 Regulation of pipeline gathering and transportation services, natural gas, NGL and crude oil sales, and transportation of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our products and services.
 23


Gathering Pipeline Regulation
 Our natural gas gathering operations are typically subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which we operate. The common purchaser statutes generally require gathering pipelines to purchase or take without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another or one source of supply over another. The regulations under these statutes can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather natural gas. The states in which we operate have adopted complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination. The rates we charge for gathering are deemed just and reasonable unless challenged in a complaint. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties. 
 Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation as a natural gas company by FERC under the NGA. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems, including the gas gathering systems that are part of the Badlands and of the Pelican and Seahawk gathering systems, meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. However, to the extent our gathering systems buy and sell natural gas, such gatherers, in their capacity as buyers and sellers of natural gas, are now subject to Order No. 704. See “—Regulation of Operations—FERC Market Transparency Rules.”
 Natural Gas Processing
 Our natural gas gathering and processing operations are not presently subject to FERC regulation. However, since May 2009, we have been required to report to FERC information regarding natural gas sale and purchase transactions for some of our operations depending on the volume of natural gas transacted during the prior calendar year. See “—Regulation of Operations—FERC Market Transparency Rules.” There can be no assurance that our processing operations will continue to be exempt from other FERC regulation in the future.
Sales of Natural Gas, NGLs and Crude Oil
 The price at which we buy and sell natural gas, NGLs and crude oil is currently not subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state rate regulation. However, with regard to our physical purchases and sales of these energy commodities and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC and/or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). See “—Regulation of Operations—EP Act of 2005.” Since May 2009, we have been required to report to FERC information regarding natural gas sale and purchase transactions for some of our operations depending on the volume of natural gas transacted during the prior calendar year. See “—Regulation of Operations—FERC Market Transparency Rules.” Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third-party damage claims by, among others, market participants, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
Interstate Natural Gas 
 We own (in conjunction with Pioneer) and operate the Driver Residue Pipeline, a gas transmission pipeline extending from our Driver processing plant in West Texas just over ten miles to points of interconnection with intrastate and interstate natural gas transmission pipelines. We have obtained a waiver from FERC of the requirements pertaining to the filing of an initial rate for service, the filing of a tariff and compliance with specified accounting and reporting requirements for the Driver Residue Pipeline. As such, the Driver Residue Pipeline is not currently subject to conventional rate regulation; to requirements FERC imposes on “open access” interstate natural gas pipelines; to the obligation to file and maintain a tariff; or to the obligation to conform to certain business practices and to file certain reports. If, however, we receive a bona fide request for firm service on the Driver Residue Pipeline from a third party, FERC would reexamine the waivers it has granted us and would require us to file for authorization to offer “open access” transportation under its regulations, which would impose additional costs upon us.
Interstate Liquids 
 Targa NGL Pipeline Company LLC (“Targa NGL”) has interstate NGL pipelines that are considered common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (the “ICA”). More specifically, Targa NGL owns an eight-inch diameter pipeline that runs between Mont Belvieu, Texas, and Galena Park, Texas. The eight-inch pipeline is regulated under the ICA and is part of an extensive mixed NGL and purity NGL pipeline receipt and delivery system that provides services to domestic and foreign import and export customers. 
 24


Additionally, we began operating portions of Grand Prix in 2018, which transports mixed NGLs from the Permian Basin, including points in New Mexico, to intermediate points in Texas. Grand Prix is expected to be fully in service in the third quarter of 2019, with transportation to Mont Belvieu, Texas. On March 1, 2018, Grand Prix submitted its initial tariff establishing initial rates with FERC. On May 1, 2018, Grand Prix acquired an additional segment of pipeline from another party, which had previously obtained and operated such pipeline segment under a temporary waiver. On May 1, 2018, upon acquiring such segment of pipeline, Grand Prix filed to voluntarily terminate the temporary waiver.
 Additionally, in 2018, Targa NGL began operating portions of a new pipeline that transports NGLs from Oklahoma to intermediate points in Oklahoma and, beginning in 2019, to Mont Belvieu, Texas. On July 27, 2018, Targa NGL submitted a petition for declaratory order to FERC on a proposed rate structure and terms of service for such new NGL pipeline system. This petition is pending at FERC. 
 The ICA requires that we maintain tariffs on file with FERC for each of these pipelines described above. Those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services as well as the rules and regulations governing these services. The ICA requires, among other things, that rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and non-discriminatory. Several of these pipelines would qualify for a waiver of filing of FERC tariffs.
 Targa NGL also owns a twenty-inch diameter pipeline and twelve-inch diameter pipeline that run between Mont Belvieu, Texas, and Galena Park, Texas and a twelve-inch diameter pipeline that runs between Mont Belvieu, Texas and Lake Charles, Louisiana, each of which transport NGLs and that have qualified for a waiver of applicable FERC regulatory requirements under the ICA based on current circumstances. In 2019, Targa NGL will complete another pipeline for exports at Targa’s Galena Park dock, and this pipeline has also qualified for such a waiver. Additionally, the crude oil pipeline system that is part of the Badlands assets also qualifies for such a waiver. Further, while Targa intended to complete construction of a new pipeline connecting to a certain interstate crude pipeline, it did not occur. In anticipation of this new pipeline, however, Targa Crude Pipeline LLC sought, and on June 27, 2018, received a waiver of applicable FERC regulatory requirements under the ICA for those possible movements on the new pipeline. Targa Crude Pipeline LLC is expected to file a request to terminate the waiver in 2019. 
 
All such waivers are subject to revocation, however, should a particular pipeline’s circumstances change. FERC could, either at the request of other entities or on its own initiative, assert that some or all of these pipelines no longer qualify for a waiver. In the event that FERC were to determine that one more of these pipelines no longer qualified for waiver, we would likely be required to file a tariff with FERC for the applicable pipeline(s), provide a cost justification for the transportation charge, and provide service to all potential shippers without undue discrimination. Such a change in the jurisdictional status of transportation on these pipelines could adversely affect our results of operations.
 
Many existing pipelines, including Grand Prix and some of Targa NGL’s pipelines, may utilize the FERC oil pipeline indexing rate methodology which, as currently in effect, allows common carriers to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the Producer Price Index. FERC’s indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. On March 15, 2018, FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes (“Revised Policy Statement”) stating, among other things, that with respect to oil and refined products pipelines subject to FERC jurisdiction, the impacts of the Revised Policy Statement and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on the costs of FERC-regulated oil and NGL pipelines will be reflected in FERC’s next five-year review of the oil pipeline index, which will generate the index level to be effective July 1, 2021. FERC’s establishment of a just and reasonable rate, including the determination of the appropriate oil pipeline index, is based on many components, and tax-related changes will affect two such components, the allowance for income taxes and the amount for accumulated deferred income taxes, while other pipeline costs also will continue to affect FERC’s determination of the appropriate pipeline index. Accordingly, depending on FERC’s application of its indexing rate methodology for the next five-year term of index rates, the Revised Policy Statement and tax effects related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 may impact our revenues associated with any transportation services we may provide pursuant to cost-of-service based rates in the future, including indexed rates.
 
Tribal Lands
 
Our intrastate natural gas pipelines in North Dakota are subject to the various regulations of the State of North Dakota. In addition, various federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), Office of Natural Resources Revenue (formerly the Minerals Management Service) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as the Three Affiliated Tribes, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to operations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. Please see “Other State and Local Regulation of Operations” below.

Intrastate Natural Gas
 Though our natural gas intrastate pipelines are not subject to regulation by FERC as natural gas companies under the NGA, our intrastate pipelines may be subject to certain FERC-imposed reporting requirements depending on the volume of natural gas purchased or sold in a given year. See “—Regulation of Operations—FERC Market Transparency Rules.”
 Our intrastate pipelines located in Texas are regulated by the Railroad Commission of Texas (the “RRC”). Our Texas intrastate pipeline, Targa Intrastate Pipeline LLC (“Targa Intrastate”), owns the intrastate pipeline that transports natural gas from its Shackelford processing plant to an interconnect with Atmos Pipeline-Texas that in turn delivers gas to the West Texas Utilities Company’s Paint Creek Power Station. Targa Intrastate also owns a 1.65-mile, ten-inch diameter intrastate pipeline that transports natural gas from a third-party gathering system into the Chico system in Denton County, Texas. Targa Intrastate is a gas utility subject to regulation by the RRC and has a tariff on file with such agency. Our other Texas intrastate pipeline, Targa Gas Pipeline LLC, owns a multi-county intrastate pipeline that transports gas in Crane, Ector, Midland, and Upton Counties, Texas, as well as some lines in North Texas. Targa Gas Pipeline LLC is a gas utility subject to regulation by the RRC and has a tariff on file with such agency.
 Our Louisiana intrastate pipeline, Targa Louisiana Intrastate LLC owns an approximately 60-mile intrastate pipeline system that receives all of the natural gas it transports within or at the boundary of the State of Louisiana. Because all such gas ultimately is consumed within Louisiana, and since the pipeline’s rates and terms of service are subject to regulation by the Office of Conservation of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (“DNR”), the pipeline qualifies as a Hinshaw pipeline under Section 1(c) of the NGA and thus is exempt from most FERC regulation.
 
We have an ownership interest of 50% of the capacity in a 50-mile long intrastate natural gas transmission pipeline, which extends from the tailgate of three natural gas processing plants located near Pettus, Texas to interconnections with existing intrastate and interstate natural gas pipelines near Refugio, Texas. The capacity is held by our subsidiary, TPL SouthTex Transmission Company LP (“TPL SouthTex Transmission”), which is entitled to transport natural gas through its capacity on behalf of third parties to both intrastate and interstate markets. Because the jointly owned pipeline system was initially interconnected only with intrastate markets, each of the capacity holders qualified as an “intrastate pipeline” within the meaning of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”) and therefore is able to provide transportation of natural gas to interstate markets under Section 311 of the NGPA. Under Sections 311 and 601 of the NGPA, an intrastate pipeline may transport natural gas in interstate commerce without becoming subject to FERC regulation as a “natural-gas company” under the NGA. Transportation of natural gas under authority of Section 311 must be filed with FERC and must be shown to be “fair and equitable.” TPL SouthTex Transmission has a Statement of Operating Conditions on file with FERC. TPL SouthTex Transmission has existing rates applicable to NGPA Section 311 service. We have a 10% ownership interest in an intrastate natural gas transmission pipeline crossing portions of Culberson, Loving, Pecos, Reeves and Ward counties in Texas and operated by Agua Blanca, LLC (“Agua Blanca”). Agua Blanca has filed rates for intrastate transportation service on the pipeline with the Railroad Commission of Texas and those rates remain pending. The intrastate rates were filed as the basis for the rates set forth in the Statement of Operating Conditions filed by Agua Blanca with FERC on July 31, 2018, pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA. The Statement of Operating Conditions and Section 311 rates remain pending before FERC but are effective subject to refund based on any required change in transportation rates on the pipeline. We anticipate that the GCX Project, which is expected to be completed in 2019 and will transport natural gas from the Permian Basin to markets on the Texas Gulf Coast, will be subject to regulation by the RRC and under Section 311 of the NGPA.
 
We also operate natural gas pipelines that extend from the tailgate of our processing plants to interconnections with both intrastate and interstate natural gas pipelines. Although these “plant tailgate” pipelines may operate at transmission pressure levels and may transport “pipeline quality” natural gas, we believe they are generally exempt from FERC’s jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act under FERC’s “stub” line exemption. However, Targa Midland Gas Pipeline LLC (“Targa Midland”) operates our Tarzan plant residue gas pipeline, which provides NGPA Section 311 service and falls outside of the “stub” line exemption. On September 13, 2018, FERC accepted Targa Midland’s petition for approval of its Statement of Operating Conditions and rates applicable to NGPA Section 311 service. On August 21, 2018, the Texas Railroad Commission accepted Targa Midland’s intrastate rates.
 
FERC issued Order No. 849 on July 18, 2018, which became effective September 13, 2018, establishing new regulations that, among other things, require pipelines providing NGPA Section 311 service to file a new rate election for its interstate rates if the intrastate pipeline’s rates on file with the state regulatory agency are reduced to reflect the reduced income tax rates adopted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. If an NGPA Section 311 pipeline’s interstate service rates are established pursuant to a rate filing with FERC, the pipeline is exempt from filing a new rate election if FERC has approved the interstate rates after December 22, 2017, or the pipeline has a pending rate petition at FERC on the effective date of the reduced intrastate rates. Any such petitions may reduce the rates we are permitted to charge for NGPA Section 311 service.

Texas and Louisiana have adopted complaint-based regulation of intrastate natural gas transportation activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to pipeline access and rate discrimination. The rates we charge for intrastate transportation are deemed just and reasonable unless challenged in a complaint. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties.
 
Intrastate Liquids
 
Our intrastate NGL pipelines in Texas transport mixed and purity NGL streams between Targa’s Mont Belvieu and Galena Park, Texas facilities. Additionally, we began operating portions of Grand Prix in 2018, which transports mixed NGLs from the Permian Basin to intermediate points in Texas. We expect Grand Prix to be fully in service in the third quarter of 2019, with transportation to Mont Belvieu, Texas. Further, we operate crude gathering pipelines in the Permian Basin. With respect to intrastate movements, these pipelines are not subject to FERC regulation, but are subject to rate regulation by the RRC. They are also subject to United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”) safety regulations.
 
Our intrastate NGL pipelines in Louisiana gather mixed NGLs streams that we own from processing plants in Louisiana and deliver such streams to the Gillis and Lake Charles fractionators in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where the mixed NGLs streams are fractionated into various products. We deliver such fractionated petroleum products (ethane, propane, butanes and natural gasoline) out of our fractionator to and from Targa-owned storage, to other third-party facilities and to various third-party pipelines in Louisiana. Additionally, through our 50% ownership interest in Cayenne Pipeline, LLC, we operate the Cayenne pipeline, which transports mixed NGLs from the Venice gas plant in Venice, Louisiana, to an interconnection with a third-party NGL pipeline in Toca, Louisiana. These pipelines are not subject to FERC regulation or rate regulation by the DNR, but are subject to DOT safety regulations. Certain of our Louisiana intrastate NGL pipelines are subject to the Louisiana Public Service Commission 2015 General Order (the “LPSC Order”) Docket No. R-33390. We are currently in the process of registering such lines in accordance with Section 1 of the LPSC Order.
 
Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry
 
EP Act of 2005
 The EP Act of 2005 is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans, and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry. Among other matters, the EP Act of 2005 amends the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC, and furthermore provides FERC with additional civil penalty authority. The EP Act of 2005 provides FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to approximately $1.27 million per violation per day, adjusted annually for inflation, for violations of the NGA and approximately $1.27 million per violation per day, adjusted annually for inflation, for violations of the NGPA. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. In 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670 to implement the anti-market manipulation provision of the EP Act of 2005. Order No. 670 does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which includes the annual reporting requirements under a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (Order No. 704), and the quarterly reporting requirement under Order No. 735. The anti-market manipulation rule and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of FERC’s NGA enforcement authority.
FERC Market Transparency Rules
 Beginning in 2007, FERC has issued a number of rules intended to provide for greater marketing transparency in the natural gas industry, including Order Nos. 704, 720, and 735. Under Order No. 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 Bcf of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors and natural gas marketers, are now required to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices.
 27


Under Order No. 720, certain non-interstate pipelines delivering, on an annual basis, more than an average of 50 million MMBtu of gas over the previous three calendar years, are required to post on a daily basis certain information regarding the pipeline’s capacity and scheduled flows for each receipt and delivery point that has a design capacity equal to or greater than 15,000 MMBtu/d and interstate pipelines are required to post information regarding the provision of no-notice service. In October 2011, Order No. 720 as clarified was vacated by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. We take the position that, at this time, all of our entities are exempt from Order No. 720 as currently effective.
 Under Order No. 735, intrastate pipelines providing transportation services under Section 311 of the NGPA and Hinshaw pipelines operating under Section 1(c) of the NGA are required to report on a quarterly basis more detailed transportation and storage transaction information, including: rates charged by the pipeline under each contract; receipt and delivery points and zones or segments covered by each contract; the quantity of natural gas the shipper is entitled to transport, store, or deliver; the duration of the contract; and whether there is an affiliate relationship between the pipeline and the shipper. Order No. 735 also extends FERC’s periodic review of the rates charged by the subject pipelines from three years to five years. On rehearing, FERC reaffirmed Order No. 735 with some modifications. As currently written, this rule does not apply to our Hinshaw pipelines.
 Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, FERC and the courts. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these or the above regulatory changes to our natural gas operations. We do not believe that we would be affected by any such FERC action materially differently than other midstream natural gas companies with whom we compete.
 
Other State and Local Regulation of Operations
 Our business activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations, as well as orders of regulatory bodies pursuant thereto, governing a wide variety of matters, including operations, marketing, production, pricing, community right-to-know, protection of the environment, safety, marine traffic and other matters. In addition, the Three Affiliated Tribes promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to operations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, on which we operate a significant portion of our Badlands gathering and processing assets. The Three Affiliated Tribes is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce certain laws and regulations independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. For additional information regarding the potential impact of federal, state, tribal or local regulatory measures on our business, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business.”
Environmental and Operational Health and Safety Matters
 
General
 Our operations are subject to numerous federal, tribal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, worker health and safety, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. As with the industry generally, compliance with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our costs to construct, maintain, upgrade and decommission equipment and facilities. We have implemented programs and policies designed to monitor and pursue operation of our pipelines, plants and other facilities in a manner consistent with existing environmental laws and regulations. The trend in environmental and worker health and safety regulation is to typically place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may adversely affect the environment or expose workers to injury and thus, any changes in environmental or worker safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of enforcement policies that may arise in the future and result in more stringent and costly waste management or disposal, pollution control, remediation or perceived worker health and safety-related requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. We may not have insurance or be fully covered by insurance against all environmental and occupational health and safety risks, and we may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. We review regulatory and environmental issues as they pertain to us and we consider regulatory and environmental issues as part of our general risk management approach. See Risk Factor “Our operations are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations and a failure to comply or an accidental release into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities” under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on environmental compliance matters. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of certain recent or pending proceedings related to environmental matters.
 Historically, our environmental and worker safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not become material in the future. The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
 
28


Hazardous Substances and Waste
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and comparable state laws impose joint and several, strict liability on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Liability of these “responsible persons” under CERCLA may include the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from these responsible persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims under CERCLA for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances into the environment. We generate materials in the course of our operations that are regulated as “hazardous substances” under CERCLA or similar state statutes and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA or similar state statutes for all or part of the costs required to clean up releases of hazardous substance into the environment.
 We also generate solid wastes, including hazardous wastes that are subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes additional stringent requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. In the course of our operations, we generate petroleum product wastes and ordinary industrial wastes that are regulated as hazardous wastes. Although certain materials generated in the exploration, development or production of crude oil and natural gas are excluded from RCRA’s hazardous waste regulations, there have been efforts from time to time to remove this exclusion. For example, in late 2016, a consent decree was issued by a federal court resolving the EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes. Under the consent decree, the EPA is required to propose a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes by March 15, 2019 or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is unnecessary. Any rulemaking proposed by the agency must be finalized by July 15, 2021. Any future changes in law or regulation that result in these wastes, including wastes currently generated during our or our customers’ operations, being designated as “hazardous wastes” and therefore subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses and, with respect to such adverse effects on our customers, could reduce the demand for our services. 
 We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that for many years have been used for midstream natural gas, NGL and crude oil activities and refined petroleum product and crude oil storage and terminaling activities. Hydrocarbons or other substances and wastes may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons or other substances and wastes have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and release of hydrocarbons or other substances and wastes was not under our control. These properties and any hydrocarbons, substances and wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) and to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination, the costs of which activities could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
Air Emissions
 The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including processing plants and compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay, restrict or cancel the development of oil and natural gas related projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues. For example, in 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of the public health and welfare. In 2017 and 2018, the EPA issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone as either “attainment/unclassifiable,” “unclassifiable” or “non-attainment.” Additionally, in November 2018, the EPA issued final requirements that apply to state, local, and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for ground-level ozone. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs. Compliance with these or other air emissions-related regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines that could delay or halt the development of projects, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 29



Climate Change
 The EPA has determined that greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions endanger public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted regulations under the CAA related to GHG emissions. See Risk Factor “The adoption and implementation of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the products and services we provide” under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on climate change and regulation of GHG emissions.
Water Discharges
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (“Clean Water Act” or “CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. Pursuant to the CWA and analogous state laws, permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state waters or waters of the United States. Any such discharge of pollutants into regulated waters must be performed in accordance with the terms of the permit issued by the EPA or the analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities and such permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water runoff. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. The CWA and analogous state laws also may impose civil and criminal penalties, as well as require remedial or mitigation measures, for non-compliance with discharge permits, including as a result of spills and other non-authorized discharges.
 In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) published a final rule attempting to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States, including wetlands. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, the EPA and the Corps agreed to reconsider the 2015 rule and, thereafter, the agencies have (i) published a proposed rule in July 2017 to rescind the 2015 rule and recodify the regulatory text that governed waters of the United States prior to promulgation of the 2015 rule, (ii) published a proposed rule in November 2017 and a final rule in February 2018 adding a February 6, 2020 applicability date to the 2015 rule, and (iii) announced a proposed rule on December 11, 2018 re-defining the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction over waters of the United States for which the agencies will seek public comment. The 2015 and February 2018 final rules are being challenged by various parties in federal district court and implementation of the 2015 rule has been enjoined in twenty-eight states pending resolution of the various federal district court challenges. As a result of these legal developments, future implementation of the 2015 rule or a revised rule is uncertain at this time. To the extent this rule or a revised rule expands the scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas in connection with any expansion activities.
 The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) which amends the CWA, establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into waters of the United States. The OPA and its associated regulations impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. A “responsible party” under the OPA includes owners and operators of onshore facilities, such as our plants and our pipelines. Under the OPA, owners and operators of facilities that handle, store, or transport oil are required to develop and implement oil spill response plans, and establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such parties could be statutorily responsible. 
 
Hydraulic Fracturing
 Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions, but several federal agencies, including the EPA and the BLM have asserted regulatory authority over aspects of the process. Also, Congress has considered, and some states and local governments have adopted legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. While we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing, if new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions or prohibitions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements and experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, which could reduce demand for our gathering, processing and fractionation services. See Risk Factor “Laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could result in restrictions, delays or cancellations in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells
 by our customers, which could adversely impact our revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas, NGLs or crude oil through our facilities and reducing the utilization of our assets” under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on hydraulic fracturing. 
 30



Endangered Species Act Considerations
 The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Some of our facilities or projects under development may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species. If endangered species are located in areas of the underlying properties where we plan to conduct development activities, such work could be restricted, delayed or prohibited or expensive mitigation may be required. Similar protections are offered to migrating birds under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Moreover, as a result of one or more settlements approved by the federal government, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) must make determinations within specified timeframes on the listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we or our customers operate or plan to develop a project could cause us or our customers to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures and could result in restrictions, delays or prohibitions in our customers’ performance of operations, which could reduce demand for our services. Certain of our operations occur within areas of American Burying Beetle habitat.
Employee Health and Safety
 We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry. In addition, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (“OSHA”) hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the Federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We and the entities in which we own an interest are subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. The regulations apply to any process that (1) involves a listed chemical in a quantity at or above the threshold quantity specified in the regulation for that chemical, or (2) involves certain flammable gases or flammable liquids present on site in one location in a quantity of 10,000 pounds or more. Flammable liquids stored in atmospheric tanks below their normal boiling point without the benefit of chilling or refrigeration are exempt. We have implemented an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and pursue operations in a manner consistent with worker safety requirements. 
Pipeline Safety Matters
 Many of our natural gas, NGL and crude pipelines are subject to regulation by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), an agency under the DOT (or state analogs), under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended (“NGPSA”), with respect to natural gas, and the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended (“HLPSA”), with respect to crude oil, NGLs and condensates. The NGPSA and HLPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of natural gas, crude oil, NGL and condensate pipeline facilities. Pursuant to these acts, PHMSA has promulgated regulations governing, among other things, pipeline design, maximum operating pressures, pipeline patrols and leak surveys, public awareness, operation and maintenance procedures, operator qualification, minimum depth requirements and emergency procedures, as well as other matters intended to ensure adequate protection for the public and to prevent accidents and failures. Additionally, PHMSA has promulgated regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for certain natural gas and hazardous liquids pipelines that, in the event of a pipeline leak or rupture, could affect “high consequence areas,” which are areas where a release could have the most significant adverse consequences, including high-population areas, certain drinking water sources and unusually sensitive ecological areas. In the past, we have not incurred material costs in connection with complying with these NGPSA and HLPSA requirements; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.
 31


Legislation in recent years has resulted in more stringent mandates for pipeline safety and has charged PHMSA with developing and adopting regulations that impose increased pipeline safety requirements on pipeline operators. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (“2011 Pipeline Safety Act”), which became law in January 2012, amended the NGPSA and HLPSA by increasing the penalties for safety violations, establishing additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and requiring studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. In June 2016, President Obama signed the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (“2016 Pipeline Safety Act”), further amending the NGPSA and HLPSA, extending PHMSA’s statutory mandate through 2019 and, among other things, required PHMSA to complete certain of its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act and develop new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities. The 2016 Pipeline Safety Act also empowers PHMSA to address unsafe conditions or practices constituting imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. PHMSA published an interim rule in 2016 to implement the agency’s expanded authority to address unsafe pipeline conditions or practices that pose an imminent hazard to life, property or the environment.
 We, or the entities in which we own an interest, inspect our pipelines regularly in a manner consistent with state and federal maintenance requirements. Nonetheless, the adoption of new or amended regulations by PHMSA that result in more stringent or costly pipeline integrity management or safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on us. The safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act as well as any implementation of PHMSA rules thereunder could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects, or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in our incurring increased operating costs or operational delays that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.
 In addition, states have adopted regulations, similar to existing PHMSA regulations, for intrastate gathering and transmission lines. Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, for example, have developed regulatory programs that parallel the federal regulatory scheme and are applicable to intrastate pipelines transporting natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. North Dakota has similarly implemented regulatory programs applicable to intrastate natural gas pipelines. We currently estimate an annual average cost of $2.6 million for the years 2019 through 2021 to perform necessary integrity management program testing on our pipelines required by existing PHMSA and state regulations. This estimate does not include the costs, if any, of any repair, remediation, or preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, which costs could be substantial. Historically, our pipeline safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 See Risk Factors “We may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from performance of pipeline integrity programs and related repairs” and 
“Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of new or more stringent safety controls or result in more stringent enforcement of applicable legal requirements could subject us to increased capital costs, operational delays and costs of operation” under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on pipeline safety standards, including integrity management requirements.
 Title to Properties and Rights of Way
 Our real property falls into two categories: (1) parcels that we own in fee and (2) parcels in which our interest derives from leases, easements, rights of way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities permitting the use of such land for our operations. Portions of the land on which our plants and other major facilities are located are owned by us in fee title and we believe that we have satisfactory title to these lands. The remainder of the land on which our plant sites and major facilities are located are held by us pursuant to ground leases between us, as lessee, and the fee owner of the lands, as lessors. We and our predecessors have leased these lands for many years without any material challenge known to us relating to the title to the land upon which the assets are located, and we believe that we have satisfactory leasehold estates to such lands. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, rights of way, permit, lease or license, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material leases, easements, rights of way, permits, leases and licenses.
 Employees
 Through a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, we employ approximately 2,460 people who primarily support our operations. None of those employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
