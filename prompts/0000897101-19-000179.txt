Products
 
Transition Networks designs, assembles and sells media converter devices, NIDs, Ethernet switches and other connectivity products that enable customers to transmit voice and data across networks and between systems using different types of media (for example, between copper and fiber). These products assist customers in resolving challenges in the areas of bandwidth constraints, security risks, and distance limitations as networks extend from local area to wide area networks and adapt to ever increasing end-user demands. As enterprise networks continue to change and evolve, our solutions enable customers to both integrate fiber optics into their existing infrastructure as their networks grow, and to extend advanced data services to their customers at remote locations, including supporting wireless networks and backhaul requirements. Many of our products incorporate features to perform advanced levels of fault management and diagnostics to troubleshoot fiber optic and copper network infrastructure. Our growing Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) products support remote devices such as cameras and wireless access points by passing electrical power along with data on Ethernet cabling, eliminating the need for local power in hard-to-reach locations.
 
Transition Networks products support a wide variety of protocols, including: 10 Gigabit Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Ethernet, T1/E1, T3/E3, DS1/DS3, RS232, RS485, OC3, OC12, among others. Transition Networks develops product hardware and software internally, and expenses the related costs as they are incurred. In connection with the sale of its hardware products, Transition Networks provides its customers with a variety of software management options including Network Management System (NMS) software for providing superior provisioning and monitoring of its Ethernet switches and other managed devices. Transition has been developing and marketing Ethernet-based networking products for over 30 years. Transition Networks continues to develop products that address the enterprise, service provider, industrial, government, and security markets. Increasingly, Transition Networks Power-over-Ethernet products are used in smart building environments, intelligent transportation applications, and in security and surveillance networks.
 
Manufacturing and Sources of Supply
 
Transition Networks uses contract manufacturers to manufacture its products in different geographical locations, in addition to OEM partners through which the Company sources product and markets under its own name. In 2018, 65% of the total value of Transition Networks’ products was manufactured in or sourced from Asia, 27% was manufactured in the US, and the remaining 8% was produced in Mexico. Offshore sources of supply are subject to certain risks, including political risk.
 
Markets and Marketing
 
Transition Networks’ products are used in a broad array of markets including federal government, enterprise, service provider, industrial, security and surveillance markets. Transition Networks has a broad customer base that uses its products in a variety of applications.
 
The line of Ethernet switches (both POE and non-POE) is used in last-mile access, backhaul, wiring closets and at end-user stations. These are sold into security networks, intelligent transportation applications, smart buildings, corporate enterprise networks and other Internet of Things applications domestically and abroad.

The “Transition Networks” brand name is important to the Company’s business. The Company believes the Transition Networks name is well known in the marketplace and with trade advertising.
 
Research and Development
 
Transition Networks develops products for the federal government, enterprise, service provider, security and industrial markets. This includes developing converters for emerging protocols and existing protocols in new markets, as well as new industry standards. Some of these products include remote management devices built on the IEEE® 802.3AH, 802.3AG, ITU-T Y.1731 standards, Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF)® standards, and Power Over Ethernet devices based on the IEEE® 802.3AF and IEEE® 802.3AT standards.
