Business Overview
 
Veritas Farms is an entirely vertically-integrated agribusiness focused on producing, marketing, and distributing highest purity full spectrum hemp products containing naturally occurring phytocannabinoids. Veritas Farms owns and operates a 140-acre farm in Pueblo, Colorado, capable of producing over 200,000 proprietary full spectrum hemp plants containing naturally occurring phytocannabinoids which yield a potential minimum annual harvest of over 200,000 pounds of outdoor-grown industrial hemp. While part of the cannabis family, hemp, which contains less than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”), the psychoactive compound that produces the “high” in marijuana, is distinguished from marijuana by its use, physical appearance and lower THC concentration (marijuana generally has a THC level of 10% or more). The Company also operates approximately 15,000 sq. ft. of climate-controlled greenhouses in Pueblo, Colorado to produce a consistent supply of year-round indoor-cultivated hemp. In addition, there is a 10,000-sq. ft. onsite facility used for processing raw hemp, oil extraction, formulation laboratories, and quality/purity testing. That facility also houses our production, packaging and distribution operations. Veritas Farms is registered with the Colorado Department of Agriculture to grow industrial hemp and with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to process hemp and manufacture hemp products in accordance with Colorado’s hemp program.
 
Veritas Farms meticulously processes its hemp crop to produce superior quality whole-plant hemp oil, extracts and derivatives which contain the entire broad spectrum of cannabinoids extracted from the flowers and leaves of hemp plants. Whole-plant hemp oil is known to provide the essential phytocannabinoid “entourage effect” resulting from the synergistic absorption of the entire broad spectrum of unique hemp cannabinoids by the receptors of the human endocannabinoid system. As a result, Veritas Farms believes that its products are premier quality cannabinoids and are highly sought after by consumers and manufacturers of premium hemp products.
 
Veritas Farms has developed a wide variety of formulated hemp products containing naturally occurring phytocannabinoids which are marketed and distributed by the Company under its Veritas Farms™ brand name. Our products are also available in bulk, white label and private label custom formulations for distributors and retailers. These types of products are in high demand by health food markets, wellness centers, physicians and other healthcare practitioners.

Veritas Farms™ products (20+ SKUs) include vegan capsules, gummies, tinctures, lotions, salves, vape oils and oral syringes. All product applications come in various flavors and strength formulations, in addition to bulk. Many of the Company’s whole-plant hemp oil products and formulations are available for purchase online directly from the Company through its Veritas Farms™ website, as well as through numerous other online retailers and “brick and mortar” retail outlets.
 
Corporate Information
 
The Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada on March 15, 2011 under the name “Armeau Brands Inc.” and changed its name to “SanSal Wellness Holdings, Inc.” effective November 7, 2017. Effective as of February 5, 2019, the Company changed its name from “SanSal Wellness Holdings, Inc.” to “Veritas Farms, Inc.”
 
Our executive offices are located at 1512 E. Broward Boulevard, Suite 300, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33301 and our telephone number is (561) 288-6603. Our corporate websites are www.theveritasfarms.com and www.sansalwellness.com. Information appearing on our websites is not part of this report. 
 
Corporate History
 
The Company’s original business objective following its incorporation, was to produce and market its own brand of ice wine made from grapes harvested in Armenia. While the Company took numerous steps with respect to implementation of its business plan, including securing sources of production and did, in fact produce 4,500 bottles of ice wine for product sampling and customer marketing purposes, the Company was unable to raise sufficient capital to fully implement its business plan and generate revenues.
 
On June 5, 2017, Jaitegh Singh purchased a total of 45,000,000 “restricted” shares of our Company’s common stock from our then sole officer and director, Cassandra Tavukciyan, for aggregate consideration of $345,000. The share purchase was consummated in a private transaction pursuant to a common stock purchase agreement entered into between Mr. Singh and Ms. Tavukciyan.
 
Concurrent with the share purchase transaction, Cassandra Tavukciyan resigned as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and sole director, and was succeeded in those capacities by Jaitegh Singh. Mr. Singh relocated the Company’s principal offices to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
 
On September 27, 2017 (“Closing”), the Company entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with all the members (the “Members”) of 271 Lake Davis Holdings, LLC d/b/a SanSal Wellness (“271”), pursuant to which it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Acquisition”). 271, founded in 2015, is a vertically-integrated agribusiness focused on producing full spectrum natural phytocannabinoid-rich industrial hemp extracts.
 
Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, we acquired all the outstanding limited liability company interests of 271 in exchange for the issuance to the Members, pro rata, of 46,800,000 “restricted” shares of our common stock, whereupon Jaitegh Singh, the holder of the Company’s currently outstanding 45,000,000 “restricted” shares of common stock contributed those shares to the capital of the Company for cancellation.
 
At Closing, Alexander M. Salgado and Erduis Sanabria, the members of 271’s management team, were appointed to the Company’s board of directors and as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President, respectively. Jaitegh Singh, who was then the Company’s President and sole director, then stepped down from such position, but assumed the position of the Company’s Vice President and Secretary. At this time, the Company has no independent directors, no audit committee, no compensation committee, and no corporate governance committee.
 
In addition, at Closing, Members, holding an aggregate of 26,674,500 shares of our common stock, including Messrs. Salgado and Sanabria, entered into a five-year voting agreement, pursuant to which Messrs. Salgado and Erduis have the right to direct the voting of their shares on all matters presented to shareholders for a vote.

Following completion of the Acquisition, the Company determined to focus its business on the business of 271. Accordingly, we applied to FINRA to (a) change our corporate name from “Armeau Brands Inc.” to “SanSal Wellness Holdings, Inc.” (with a comparable change in our trading symbol from ARUU to SSWH); (b) authorize a class of “blank check” preferred stock; and (c) implement a six-for-one forward stock split. The name, trading symbol and authorized capitalization changes became effective as of November 7, 2017 and the stock split was implemented on November 9, 2017.
 
As a result of the completion of the Acquisition and management’s determination to focus the Company’s future business efforts on the Veritas Farms business, 271 is deemed to be the survivor of the Acquisition for financial statement purposes. Moreover, we changed the Company’s fiscal year-end from January 31 to December 31 to coincide with 271’s fiscal year-end, effective with the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
Effective as of February 5, 2019, the Company changed its corporate name from “SanSal Wellness Holdings, Inc.” to “Veritas Farms, Inc.” and changed its trading symbol from SSWH to VFRM. The corporate name and symbol change reflect the Company’s focus on the expansion of its established Veritas Farms™ hemp extract products brand with consumers, distributors, partners, investors, and the media
 
Our Mission
 
Veritas Farms is a pioneer in quality phytocannabinoid products and organic farming methods. It is committed to serving the global community by uncompromising on our quality and continuing the pursuit of cutting-edge, ethical innovation.
 
Veritas Farms is different. We produce pure natural hemp derivatives, pesticide residual and solvent free, with whole plant phytocannabinoids. We achieve highest potency and purity in the derivative products from our oils.
 
Veritas Farms is committed to the research and development of improved, proprietary hemp genetics cultivation and innovation in order to provide the global community with uncompromised quality hemp products, containing the highest quality, quantity and consistency in the industry.
 
Our commitment to enhancing the symbiotic relationship between healthy plants and healthy people ensures that we provide whole plant, broad spectrum cannabinoid-rich hemp products while using only natural protocols and sustainable farming methods.
 
Our philosophy is to practice strict natural protocols for hemp cultivation and the latest technology to assist our sustainable, environmentally sound farming practices to ensure pure, pesticide free, and high quality consistent products.
 
Why Cannabinoids? 
 
Cannabinoid-rich hemp oil is made from the stalks and leaves of the cannabis sativa plant. Like tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, cannabinoid-rich hemp is an active cannabinoid found in cannabis plants. Unlike THC, however, cannabinoid-rich hemp has no psychoactive properties — and its health benefits may be even more profound than those of THC.
 
What are cannabinoids? They are chemical compounds secreted by the flowers of the cannabis plant. Our brains have receptors that respond pharmacologically to them. THC is the psychoactive cannabinoid, which binds to receptors in the brain, while cannabinoid-rich hemp binds to receptors throughout the body. Whole-plant hemp extracts are known to provide the essential phytocannabinoid “entourage effect” resulting from the synergistic absorption of the entire broad spectrum of unique hemp cannabinoids by the receptors of the human endocannabinoid system.
 
Through our body’s endocannabinoid receptors, cannabinoid-rich hemp can mitigate both pain and swelling or inflammation associated with it. Science has long known about cannabinoid’s analgesic properties, which is why we now have any number of cannabinoid-rich hemp-infused topical creams and salves designed for direct application to skin.

There seems to be no end to the painful conditions for which cannabinoid-rich hemp could mean a measure of localized relief. Enthusiasts commonly cite arthritis, menstrual cramps, headaches, and even plain old muscle soreness or the itchiness from psoriasis and dermatitis as potential targets for the cannabis compound.
 
Current Industry Factors
 
Typical Cannabinoid Company Profile. The majority of cannabinoid companies are either farmers/extractors, manufacturers, or retail brands. Farmers often grow and extract their oil, sometimes selling their oil wholesale to product manufacturers and sometimes manufacturing their own products and then selling them in bulk to brands that use them for private label products. Retail brands are forced into a state of constant supply search and often have to order from multiple farmers/extractors in order to ensure their demand is met. This causes inconsistency in product potency and quality, often leading to products that don’t have accurate Certificate of Analysis’ (COA’s) or additional contaminate tests.
Poor Quality Products, Morally Questionable Companies. As with any burgeoning new market, opportunistic entrepreneurs and entities have surfaced selling inferior products that are often misrepresented and mislabeled. These products may contain little to no active cannabinoid compounds, “dirty” or contaminated cannabinoid compounds, and often are aiming to find a quick payday for the company’s founders and take advantage of the lack of consumer education about the industry.
 
Lack of Consumer Knowledge/Confusion in Market Place. New markets and products are often rife with miseducation and misunderstanding. Cannabinoid products are just beginning to be absorbed by the mainstream public, who is still very un-aware of quality control concerns and how to alleviate them, proper applications and treatment uses, and dosing.
 
Our goal is to secure as large a share of the growing market for cannabinoid products as possible, by taking advantage of the fractured nature of the industry, the sometimes poor quality products offered and the lack of knowledge of the potential benefits of cannabinoid through:
 

● | Offering only the highest quality products by maintaining control of the growing, extracting and manufacturing processes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Providing a one-stop vertically integrated source for cannabinoid products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing demand by educating consumers on the potential benefits of use of cannabinoid products; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Employing an integrated marketing plan across both traditional and digital channels.

Production
 
Hemp growth, extraction, processing, formulation and product manufacture takes place at our facilities located on our 140-acre farm in Pueblo Colorado. Our farm is capable of producing over 200,000 plants yielding a potential minimum annual harvest of 200,000 to 300,000 pounds of outdoor grown hemp.
 
In addition, the Company’s 15,000 square feet of climate-controlled greenhouses produce a consistent supply of approximately 25,000 pounds per year of indoor cultivated hemp over 4-6 individual harvests.
 
There is an additional 10,000 sq. ft. on-site facility used for plant processing and oil extraction, in addition to housing Veritas Farms’ testing and formulation laboratories, wherein GMP (good manufacturing practices) are strictly maintained.
 
The production process starts in the ground, with our cultivation team. Veritas Farms is fortunate to have a team of dedicated, experienced, and passionate farming experts that nurture our plants with individual care, much like the care and attention paid to vines in a vineyard.
 
After harvest, our in-house laboratory chemists and extraction technicians produce varieties of high quality, pure hemp derivative oils while constantly finding methods to improve processes and improve our products.
 
Veritas Farms uses advanced, strict natural protocols to cultivate its cannabinoid-rich hemp oil yield from its plants. After naturally air drying, only the leaves and flowers richly coated with trichomes are processed with our advanced ethanol spray evaporation extractors according to the planned uses for the cannabinoid-rich hemp extracts. Whole plant full spectrum cannabinoid-rich hemp extracts are then further processed using chromatography and other techniques yielding pure distillates and other derivatives exceeding 80% cannabinoid-rich hemp with 0% THC (if so desired).

To date, substantially all of our revenues have been generated from sales of our products to a limited number of distributors in the business-to-business channel. For the year ended December 31, 2018, two customers accounted for 28% and 11% of sales, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, one customer accounted for 72% of sales. If any of these customers fails to timely pay us amounts owed, we could suffer a significant decline in cash flow and liquidity. Accordingly, until we expand our sales channels and customer base, the loss or failure to pay amounts owed when due of any of such customers could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition
 
As part of the Company’s increased focus on sales and marketing, Veritas Farms recently launched a line of products under its own proprietary brand, Veritas Farms™, including hemp oil and extract products. The Veritas Farms™ brand line, including new packaging, was developed to expand the Company’s potential customer base. The Veritas Farms™ product line is expected to ultimately include vegan capsules, gummies, tinctures, lotions, salves, and oral syringes in various potency levels and flavors.
 
Currently, Veritas Farms incorporates an aggressive marketing plan to compete in the Cannabinoid industry. To become a market leader in the industry, the Company plans to use three primary channels to market its products, web-based marketing, traditional marketing and medical marketing.
 
Web-Based Marketing
 
General. Veritas Farms’ expanded Veritas Farms™ e-commerce retail platform, which was launched in the second quarter of 2018, is designed to be a source for offering the Company’s premium phytocannabinoid-rich extract products directly to consumers under the Veritas Farms™ brand. The site has the ability to quickly adapt to a rapidly evolving market and to position our branded product lines as a leader in the industry. In addition to its e-commerce platform, Veritas Farms is pursuing distribution with leading third-party online retailers.
 
Content Marketing via Blogs and Social Media. We believe that content marketing offers a cost-effective marketing strategy. The core components to Veritas Farms’ content marketing strategy are blogs and social media posts. Veritas Farms has partnered with Content Bacon (https://contentbacon.com/) to establish a market leader presence surrounding the cannabinoid industry, especially since blogging has the strongest impact on content marketing return on investment.1 Veritas Farms plans to launch an engaging social media campaign to promote the overall vision to quality and transparent phytocannabinoid products.

Influencer Campaigns. Influencer marketing is a type of marketing that focuses on using online leaders to drive the brand’s message to the larger market. Rather than market directly to a large group of consumers, Veritas Farms will partner with influencers to utilize their personal social channels to spread the word about the brand.2 Influencers would be celebrities, high-quality content creators, buzz builders and promoters and natural health advocates. Extensive tracking methods will be implemented to determine the effectiveness of the influencer campaigns.
 
Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is important for establishing and creating an online presence. Most every single online interaction starts with key words manually entered into a search engine to draw up relevant website options for the user. With SEO keywords maximized throughout Veritas Farms’ digital media campaign, the Target Market has a 93% increased chance of exposure to the brand.3 The Veritas Farms SEO marketing plan contemplates a monthly campaign to ensure the website ranks in top relevance for industry-related searches on major search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo.
 
Magazine and Guest Blog Features. Through a number of features in industry-related magazines and websites, such as: The Money Show, New To The Street on Fox Business and the National Hemp Association, Veritas Farms plans to consistently promote its brand and products and educate consumers with other hemp industry-related information.
 
Traditional Marketing
 
In-House Sales Force Expansion. Veritas Farms maintains an in-house sales force to market to wholesale and retail accounts. Commencing in the second half of 2018, we undertook a significant expansion of our in-house sales team. The in-house sales team, which is based out of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, focuses on marketing to wholesale and retail accounts nationwide to grow our market share in traditional retail. In addition, we plan to further expand that portion of our sales team, which travels to major markets nationwide and focuses on direct sales to larger potential customers such as retail chains, including regional grocery stores, health food stores, and pharmacies. Further, they will be tasked with supporting retail account sales growth using staff education and incentives, point-of-sale promotions and in-store customer samplings.
 
Industry-Related Trade Shows and Conventions. Veritas Farms currently participates in major industry trade shows and conventions to develop its business to business and business to consumer sales pipelines. These expos include Natural Food and Vitamin, Holistic Healing, Pharmacy and Medical, Chiropractic, Cannabis/Phytocannabinoid, Sports Health, Veterinarian, Pet Food and Supply, and Natural Products. The Company plans to continue and expand these sales and marketing efforts.

Medical Sales and Marketing
 
Veritas Farms is completing development and during 2019 expects to launch of its new line of medical products, formulated in partnership with dermatologists, internists, chiropractors and veterinarians. In order to attract medical professionals and patients alike, the new line will be marketed and sold under a stand-alone brand and will be available exclusively to medical professionals.
 
We intend to make the line available only through medical professionals, pharmacies, and a dedicated portion of the e-commerce website that will require a promotional code from a partner medical professional.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to:
 

● | The production of our products;
--+--------------------------------


● | Environmental protection;
--+--------------------------


● | Interstate commerce and taxation; and
--+--------------------------------------


● | Workplace and safety conditions, minimum wage and other labor requirements.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The federal Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, signed into law on December 20, 2018, along with the Agricultural Act of 2014, the corresponding Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 provisions (as extended by resolution into 2018) and Colorado’s Industrial Hemp Regulatory Program and related state law, provide for the cultivation of hemp, and processing and manufacturing of hemp products, as part of agricultural pilot programs and/or state plans adopted by individual states, including Colorado (pursuant to which we operate). However, there can be no assurance that new legislation or regulations may be introduced at either the federal and/or state level which, if passed, would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on the manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution and sale of hemp-derived products. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation, elimination or relabeling of certain products to meet new standards and revisions to certain sales and marketing materials and it is possible that the costs of complying with these new regulatory requirements could be material.
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and their state-level equivalents, possess broad authority to enforce the provisions of federal and state law, respectively, applicable to consumer products and safeguards as such relate to foods, dietary supplements and cosmetics, including powers to issue a public warning or notice of violation letter to a Company, publicize information about illegal products, detain products intended for import or export (in conjunction with U.S. Customs and Boarder Protection) or otherwise deemed illegal, request a recall of illegal products from the market, and request the Department of Justice, or the state-level equivalent, to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action, or a criminal prosecution in the U.S. or respective state courts. The initiation of any regulatory action towards industrial hemp or hemp derivatives by the FDA, FTC or any other related federal or state agency, would result in greater legal cost to Veritas Farms, may result in substantial financial penalties and enjoinment from certain business-related activities, and if such actions were publicly reported, they may have a materially adverse effect on the Company, its business and its results of operations.
 
Competition
 
The industrial hemp cultivation and derivative products industry is relatively new and evolving. While we believe that the industry is fragmented at the present time, there are numerous competitors, including Green Roads, Charlotte’s Web, Folium Biosciences, CBD Rx. St. Mary’s Nutritional and CV Sciences, some of whom may be larger and have a longer operating history and greater financial resources than does the Company. Moreover, we may also face competition with larger firms in consumer products manufacturing and distribution industry, who elect to enter the market given the relatively low barriers to entry. Veritas Farms believes that it competes effectively with its competitors because of its vertical integration through the cultivation, extraction, formulation, manufacturing and distribution processes, the quality of its products and customer service. However, no assurance can be given that Veritas Farms will effectively compete with its existing or future competitors.

Employees
 
As of the date of this report, we have 71 full-time employees including our executive officers, ten of whom are based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and 61 of whom are based in Pueblo, Colorado, with the Company employing up to an additional 25-30 employees in Pueblo, Colorado during the outdoor harvest season.
