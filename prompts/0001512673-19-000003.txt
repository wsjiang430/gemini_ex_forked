Item 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
We started Square in February 2009 to enable businesses (sellers) to accept card payments, an important capability that was previously inaccessible to many businesses. However, sellers need many innovative solutions to thrive, and we have since expanded to provide additional products and services to give them access to a cohesive ecosystem of tools to help them manage their business. In the same way that we have provided businesses with fast, elegant, and cohesive tools, we see an opportunity with our Cash App product to build a similar ecosystem of services for individuals. Our purpose of economic empowerment drives the development of all our products and services, as everything we do should give people accessible, affordable tools to grow their businesses and participate in the economy.
Square is a cohesive commerce ecosystem that helps our sellers start, run, and grow their businesses. We combine sophisticated software with affordable hardware to provide sellers powerful payment and point-of-sale solutions. We achieve high seller acceptance rates and fast onboarding, while maintaining low risk and fraud losses as a result of our approach to risk management that emphasizes data science and machine learning. We focus on technology and design to create products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and elegant. These attributes differentiate Square in a fragmented industry that forces sellers to stitch together hardware, software, and payments services from multiple vendors.
The foundation of our ecosystem is a full service, managed payments offering. Once a seller downloads the Square Point of Sale mobile app, they can quickly and easily take their first payment, typically within minutes. With our offering, a seller can accept payments in person via magnetic stripe (a swipe), EMV (Europay, MasterCard, and Visa) (a dip), or NFC (Near Field Communication) (a tap); or online via Square Invoices, Square Virtual Terminal, or the seller’s website or app. Once on our system, sellers gain access to features such as next-day settlements, digital receipts, payment dispute management, data security, and Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance. 

Our commerce ecosystem also includes point-of-sale software and services that help sellers make informed business decisions through the use of analytics and reporting. In the second quarter of 2018, we acquired Weebly to enable sellers to easily start or grow an omnichannel business with one cohesive solution. Sellers can manage orders, inventory, locations, employees, and payroll; engage customers and grow their sales; build a website or online store with Weebly; and gain access to business loans through Square Capital. We monetize these features through either a per transaction fee, a subscription fee, or a service fee. 
We have also extended our ecosystem to serve sellers with more specific needs. Our developer platform provides tools for developers to build on top of our existing products and services, and integrate with third-party solutions that work best for a seller's business. In addition, certain verticals, such as services businesses, retail sellers, and restaurants have access to industry specific products such as Invoices, Appointments, Square for Retail, and Square for Restaurants. We also serve sellers through Caviar, a food ordering service for pickup and delivery that helps restaurants reach new customers and increase sales.
We have grown rapidly to serve millions of sellers that represent a diverse set of industries and sizes, ranging from a single vendor at a farmers’ market to multi-location businesses. Square sellers also span geographies including the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we processed $84.7 billion of Gross Payment Volume (GPV), which was generated by nearly 1.8 billion card payments from approximately 342 million payment cards. We processed $65.3 billion and $49.7 billion of GPV in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our ability to add new sellers efficiently, and help them grow their business after they join our platform, has historically led to continued and sustained growth. Our existing sellers also represent a sizable opportunity to up-sell and cross-sell products and services with reduced incremental sales and marketing expense. 
Cash App is an ecosystem of financial tools for individuals to send, spend, and store money. With Cash App, customers can send and receive P2P (peer-to-peer) payments, receive direct deposit payments, and fund their account with bank account or debit card. Customers can make purchases with their Cash Card, a Visa prepaid card that is linked to the balance stored in Cash App. With Cash Boost, customers receive instant discounts when they make Cash Card purchases at designated merchants. Customers can also use their stored funds to buy and sell bitcoin within Cash App.

Our Products and Services

Managed Payments Solutions
The foundation of our ecosystem is a full service, managed payments offering. Sellers can onboard to Square in minutes and, once onboarded, accept payments in person via swipe, dip, or tap of a card or online via a stored card on file or payment entry form. Sellers pay a transparent transaction fee which includes next-day settlements (or instant settlement for an additional fee via Instant Deposit), payment dispute management, data security, and PCI compliance. 
During the first quarter of 2019, we launched Square Card to provide a new way for sellers to spend and manage their funds. Square Card is a free business prepaid debit card that enables sellers to spend their proceeds as soon as they make a sale. When a seller takes a payment, the proceeds immediately go into their Square stored balance and can be spent using their card or withdrawn from an ATM. Square earns interchange fees when sellers make purchases with Square Card.
Hardware
Our affordable, custom-designed hardware can process all major card payment forms, including magnetic stripe, EMV chip, and NFC. Sellers are able to accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover for one transaction fee. Additionally, sellers are able to accept local payment forms such as Interac Flash in Canada, JCB in Japan, and eftpos in Australia. Our hardware portfolio includes the following:

• | Magstripe reader: This reader enables swiped transactions of magnetic stripe cards by connecting with an iOS or Android smartphone or tablet via headphone jack or lightning connector.


• | Contactless and chip reader: This reader accepts EMV chip cards and NFC payments, enabling acceptance via Apple Pay, Google Pay, and other mobile wallets. The reader connects wirelessly or via USB.


• | Square Stand: This hardware enables an iPad to be used as a payment terminal or full point of sale solution. It features an integrated magnetic stripe reader, provides power to a connected iPad, and can connect to the contactless and chip reader wirelessly or via USB. Square Stand also connects to various peripheral devices that brick-and-mortar businesses use, such as cash drawers and receipt printers.


• | Square Register: This all-in-one offering combines our hardware, point-of-sale software, and payments technology. The dedicated hardware consists of two screens: a seller display and a customer display with a built-in card reader that accepts tap, dip, and swipe payments. Square Register does not require a third-party device, and it contains connections for Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and a USB hub so sellers can integrate with peripheral devices.


• | Square Terminal: During the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Square Terminal, a portable, all-in-one payments device to replace traditional keypad terminals. Square Terminal accepts all major payment types, including tap, dip, and swipe, and also prints receipts. It has both Wi-Fi and Ethernet internet connectivity.

Software
Square offers a suite of integrated, cloud-based software solutions to help sellers more effectively operate and manage their business. 
Our point of sale solutions are designed to be intuitive for self-serve setup and employee onboarding, to keep the line quickly moving, and to enable a holistic view of sales, customers, and employees: 

• | Square Point of Sale is a general purpose point-of-sale software that can be downloaded to an iOS or Android device and is pre-installed on Square Register. Sellers can automatically keep track of sales, inventory, and customers’ purchase histories, as well as send digital receipts and collect instant customer feedback to improve their service. As a cloud-based service, sellers get frequent software updates and upgrades seamlessly.

• | Square Appointments provides sellers in the services industry with an integrated solution from which they can create a seamless experience from booking to payment. Customers can easily schedule appointments with their preferred time, service, and staff member, and sellers can easily accept payments.


• | Square for Retail provides sellers in the retail industry with a point-of-sale solution that includes barcode scanning; advanced inventory management that supports tens of thousands of items, cost of goods sold, purchase orders, vendor management; and capabilities that allow retail sellers to better understand their customers’ habits.


• | Square for Restaurants, launched in the second quarter of 2018, is a point-of-sale solution for full-service restaurants that enables staff to serve diners while also managing tables, orders, courses, and tickets. Square for Restaurants also provides back of the house functionality, such as revenue and cost reporting, helping managers and owners make informed decisions and run a more efficient business.

Beyond Square Point of Sale, Square also offers products to allow sellers to accept payments beyond in-person channels:

• | With Square Invoices, a seller can securely collect payments by creating and sending a custom digital invoice to their customer. Square Invoices is integrated with Customer Directory and synced across Square Point of Sale and Square Dashboard, our cloud-based reporting and analytics tool, allowing the seller to easily track invoices, send payment reminders to the customer, and set recurring billing. Sellers may use Square Invoices for upcoming or previously-delivered goods and services, such as catering orders, contractor services, and retail orders.


• | Virtual Terminal allows sellers to accept payments from a web browser. Virtual Terminal helps serve sellers who run their business from a computer where companion tools such as email, customer lists, and scheduling operate alongside Virtual Terminal.


• | Weebly provides customers around the world with tools to easily build a professional website or online store. An online store with Weebly provides sellers with integrated shipping, inventory management, and marketing, and as part of Square's commerce offering, Weebly customers can sell in-person. Weebly has millions of customers and more than 625,000 paid subscribers.

We offer additional advanced functionality: 

• | Square Dashboard, our cloud-based reporting and analytics tool, provides sellers with real-time data and insights about transactions, sales, items, customers, and employees. This reporting enables sellers to make informed, timely decisions about their business.


• | Square Loyalty and Marketing provide CRM (customer relationship management) tools that help sellers engage with their buyers to grow their business. By linking customer data with point-of-sale and transaction data, we can offer our sellers an integrated loyalty program and targeted marketing campaigns and a closed-loop system that allows sellers to easily assess the return on investment of their marketing efforts.


• | Square Payroll empowers sellers to grow and manage their business by making it easy to hire, onboard, and pay wages and associated taxes for employees. Square Payroll is available nationwide in the United States and also enables employers to offer their employees benefits.

Developer Platform
Our developer platform consists of tools including APIs (application programming interfaces) and SDKs (software development kits) that enable third-party developers to integrate Square payments with their apps, websites, and/or back office systems. A solution built with Square’s APIs or SDKs gives developers all the benefits of Square’s ecosystem and managed payments offering, including PCI compliance, next-day settlements, and data security.

• | In-person payments: Square Reader SDK, which launched in the third quarter of 2018, enables developers to seamlessly integrate Square hardware with a seller’s custom point of sale, and allow them to build unique checkout experiences such as self-ordering kiosks.

6


• | Online payments: With our online payments APIs, developers can integrate Square payments with an e-commerce website or online store.


• | Mobile payments: In-App Payments SDK, which launched in the first quarter of 2019, enables developers to build consumer mobile apps that use Square to process payments.


• | Commerce: With our commerce APIs, developers can manage orders, product catalogs, inventory, customer profiles, employees, and more in order to integrate business solutions such as accounting, CRM software, customer databases, employee management, and ERP (enterprise resource planning) software.

Square has a growing network of partners building solutions with Square APIs and SDKs. These partners expand our addressable market to businesses with individualized or industry-specific needs. Through the Square App Marketplace, our partners are able to expand their own addressable market by reaching the millions of sellers using Square.
Cash App
In the same way that we have provided businesses with fast, elegant, and cohesive tools, we see an opportunity with Cash App to build a similar ecosystem of services for individuals. Cash App enables individuals to electronically send, store, and spend money, among other services. Individuals can sign up for a Cash App account with only an email address or a phone number, which allows customers to onboard in minutes. Cash App started with the ability for customers to send and track P2P (peer-to-peer) payments and deposit stored funds into their bank account. 
We have expanded Cash App beyond P2P to provide individuals with more ways to add and spend stored funds. Customers can receive direct deposit payments (such as payroll from an employer) or ACH payments from a financial institution. Customers can make purchases or withdraw funds from ATMs (automated teller machines) with their Cash Card, a Visa prepaid card that is linked to the balance the customer stores in Cash App. In the second quarter of 2018, we launched Cash Boost, a free rewards program that gives customers instant discounts when they make Cash Card purchases at merchants such as coffee shops and national brands such as Chipotle. Customers can also use their stored funds to buy and sell bitcoin. We expanded Cash App internationally and launched Cash App’s P2P service in the UK during the first quarter of 2018.
Square generates revenue when:

• | Customers transfer funds to their bank account via Instant Deposit


• | Customers conduct purchase transactions with Cash Card


• | Customers complete P2P transactions using a credit card


• | Customers buy bitcoin within the app


• | Businesses use Cash App to accept payments from their customers (Cash for Business)

Caviar
Caviar is our food ordering platform, which is another service we offer that helps restaurants grow and provides a differentiated way to service the food and beverage vertical, a large target market for managed payments and point-of-sale solutions. Caviar makes it easy for restaurants to offer food ordering, pickup, delivery, and catering to their customers, enabling them to expand their sales and grow revenue. For diners, Caviar facilitates a wide variety of fulfillment types (pickup, delivery, and group ordering).
Caviar has also expanded its group ordering capabilities. With Caviar for Teams, groups of diners have the ability to easily place large orders through Caviar with a shared cart. In the second quarter of 2018, we acquired Zesty, which added a white-glove catering option for corporate customers to the Caviar for Teams offering. 
7

Caviar is currently available in over 20 U.S. cities, including San Francisco, New York, and Philadelphia, with thousands of partner restaurants. Caviar charges diners a delivery and service fee per order. We also charge our partner restaurants a seller fee as a percentage of total food order value.
Square Capital
Square Capital, through a partnership with an industrial bank, facilitates loans to qualified Square sellers based on current payment and point-of-sale data. Square Capital eliminates the lengthy (and often unsuccessful) loan application process for the seller, while facilitating prudent risk management. The terms are straightforward for sellers, and once approved, they get their funds quickly, often the next business day. Sellers can use these funds to make investments in their business, such as purchasing inventory or equipment, hiring additional employees, expanding their stores, opening new locations, or any other business need.
Generally, for loans to Square sellers, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. Loans are typically less than 15% of a seller's annual GPV and, by simply running their business, sellers repay their loan within an average of eight to nine months. We currently fund a majority of these loans from arrangements with institutional third-party investors who purchase these loans on a forward-flow basis. This funding significantly increases the speed with which we can scale Square Capital services and allows us to mitigate our balance sheet and liquidity risk. Through the Square Capital Partnership Platform, Square also offers loans to sellers of its partners who do not process payments through Square.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Square Installments which offers an additional growth tool to qualified sellers. With Square Installments, sellers can offer their customers the option to pay for large purchases (between $250 and $10,000) over time in fixed monthly payments.
Since its public launch in May 2014, Square Capital has facilitated over 650,000 loans and advances, representing $4.0 billion. 
Our Sellers
Our sellers represent a diverse range of industries (including services, food-related, and retail businesses) and sizes, ranging from a single vendor at a farmers’ market to multi-location businesses. These sellers also span geographies including the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom. We believe the diversity of our sellers underscores the accessibility and flexibility of our offerings.
We are increasingly serving larger sellers, which we define as sellers that generate more than $125,000 in annualized GPV. Our ability to service larger sellers is due to our ability to offer more complex solutions and a greater suite of services. GPV from larger sellers represented 51% of total GPV in the fourth quarter of 2018, up from 47% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 43% in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had no customer who accounted for greater than 10% of our GPV or our total net revenue.

The charts below show the percentage mix of our GPV by seller industry and seller size:

Sales and Marketing
We have a strong brand and continue to increase awareness of Square and our ecosystem among sellers and individuals by enhancing our services and fostering rapid adoption through brand affinity, direct marketing, public relations, and strategic partnerships. Our Net Promoter Score (NPS) has averaged more than 70 over the past four quarters, which is double the average score for banking providers. Our high NPS means our sellers recommend our services to others, which we believe strengthens our brand and helps drive efficient customer acquisition.
Direct marketing, online and offline, has also been an effective customer acquisition channel. This includes online search engine optimization and marketing, online display advertising, direct mail campaigns, direct response television advertising, mobile advertising, and affiliate and seller referral programs. Additionally, Square hardware products, such as our contactless and chip reader, Square Stand or Square Register, are available at over 24,000 retail stores (including Apple, Amazon, Best Buy, Staples, Target, and Walmart). Our direct sales and account management teams also contribute to the acquisition and support of larger sellers. In addition to direct channels, we work with third-party partners and developers who offer our solutions to their customers.
Our direct, ongoing interactions with our sellers help us tailor offerings to them, at scale, and in the context of their usage. We use various scalable communication channels, such as email marketing, in-app notifications and messaging, dashboard alerts, and Square Communities, our online forum for sellers, that are designed to increase the awareness and usage of our products and services with little incremental sales and marketing expense.
Product Development and Technology
We design our products and services to be cohesive, fast, self-serve, and elegant, and we organize our product teams accordingly, combining individuals from product management, development and engineering, data science, and design. Our products and services are mobile-first and platform-agnostic, and we are able to continuously optimize them because our hardware, software, and payments processing are integrated. We frequently update our software products and have a regular software release schedule with improvements deployed generally twice a month, ensuring our sellers get immediate access to the latest features. Our services are built on a scalable technology platform, and we place a strong emphasis on data analytics and machine learning to maximize the efficacy, efficiency, and scalability of our services. This enables us to capture and analyze over a billion transactions per year and automate risk assessment for more than 99.95% of all transactions. Our hardware is designed and developed in-house, and we contract with third-party manufacturers for production. 
Transaction Processing Overview
Processing card transactions requires close coordination among a number of industry participants that provide the services and infrastructure necessary to enable such transactions. These participants consist of payment service providers, acquiring processors, card networks, and issuing banks. Square serves as a payment service provider, acting as the touch point for the seller to the rest of the payment chain. The definitions and graphic below outline this payment chain and the typical flow of a Square transaction, along with the types of fees typically paid and received at each stage.
Payment Service Provider (PSP): Provider of the payment services that holds the direct relationship with the seller and facilitates all aspects of the transaction on behalf of the seller. Square is a PSP and is compensated by the seller for the services provided. 
Merchant of Record: Square also serves as the merchant of record for the transaction. The merchant of record is liable for the settlement of transactions processed and accordingly enters into contractual arrangements and negotiates terms, including pricing, with the acquiring processors and the relevant card networks. The merchant of record is also contractually responsible for settling the costs incurred in the process. Additionally as merchant of record, Square controls the services delivered to the seller, has discretion in setting prices charged to sellers, and has unilateral ability to accept or reject transactions.
Acquiring Processor: Provider of the back-end technology and gateway services that facilitate the flow of payment information through the card networks to the issuing bank. The acquiring processor maintains integration with the merchant of record and is directly affiliated with an acquiring bank.
10

Acquiring Bank: The financial institution associated with the acquiring processor, which maintains the relationship with the card networks.
Card Networks (e.g. Visa, MasterCard): Provider of the card brand and network infrastructure flow from the acquiring processor to the issuing bank.
Issuing Bank: The financial institution that issues the buyer’s payment card.

1. | Once the buyer is ready to make a purchase, the seller initiates the transaction using the Square Point of Sale and presents the buyer with the amount owed.


2. | For in-person transactions, the buyer pays by swiping or dipping their payment card, or by tapping an NFC-enabled payment card or mobile device on a Square Reader, Square Stand, Square Register or Square Terminal, as applicable, which captures the buyer’s payment information. For card not present transactions the seller can either use the customer's

11

card on file or the card information may be keyed in manually by either the buyer or seller. Such card not present transactions may be initiated using the Square Point of Sale app, Square Invoices, Square Virtual Terminal, or the seller's eCommerce website.

3. | Square initiates the transaction, acting as the PSP.


4. | Square passes the transaction information to the acquiring processor. Square pays a fixed per transaction fee to the acquiring processor.


5. | The acquiring processor routes the transaction to the relevant card network affiliated with the buyer’s card (e.g., American Express, Mastercard, or Visa). Square pays a variety of card network fees, which includes card service assessments of roughly 0.10% to 0.15% of the transaction amount. 


6. | The card network then routes the transaction to the issuing bank, which authorizes or declines the buyer’s payment card transaction.


7. | The issuing bank sends a notification back through the card network to the acquiring processor and the Square Point of Sale to inform the seller that the transaction has been authorized or declined.


8. | If authorized, the Square Point of Sale may send a digital receipt for the transaction on behalf of the seller to the buyer. The digital receipt enables a persistent communication channel that further allows the buyer to provide feedback to the seller.


9. | Upon settlement, the issuing bank disburses funds to the acquiring bank through the card network for the final transaction amount. The issuing bank is reimbursed an interchange or merchant discount fee as both a percentage of the amount of the transaction and a fixed fee per transaction, which together average between 1.5% to 2.0% of the transaction amount. However, this percentage varies significantly based on the buyer's card type, the transaction type, and the transaction size.


10. | Square transfers funds to the seller’s bank account, less applicable fees as charged by Square. Square provides sellers with fast access to funds, typically disbursing funds within a business day after the date of the transaction. Deposits use Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers, or leverage the same day Instant Deposit service for an additional transaction fee.


11. | The funds are settled from the acquiring bank to Square, typically in one to two business days after the date of the transaction.


12. | At the end of each monthly billing cycle, the issuing bank provides a statement to the buyer including all applicable monthly charges. The statement includes a reference to Square as the merchant of record on the billing statement as a prefix to the seller name (denoted as SQ).

Our Competition
The markets in which we operate are competitive and evolving. Our competitors range from large, well-established vendors to smaller, earlier-stage companies.
We seek to differentiate ourselves from competitors primarily on the basis of our commerce ecosystem and our focus on building products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and elegant. With respect to each of these factors, we believe that we compare favorably to our competitors.
For payments and point-of-sale services, we compete primarily with traditional acquiring processors and payment processors who sell costly card terminal and point-of-sale systems, often tied to long-term contracts, through direct sales or Independent Sales Organization (ISO) channels. Many competitors offer payments and point-of-sale services that have features tailored to particular industries or business types but require sellers to stitch together technology from multiple hardware, software, and payments vendors.
12

Some sellers may elect to use individual point-of-sale solutions from other companies that overlap with certain functions and features that we provide, including:

• | Business software providers such as those that provide inventory management, analytics, customer management and marketing, e-commerce, payroll, website building tools, invoices and appointments solutions;


• | Established or new alternative lenders; and


• | Food delivery service providers.

Cash App is our ecosystem of services for individuals that competes with other financial apps. It provides a differentiated combination of financial tools for individuals, including peer-to-peer payments, the ability to buy and sell bitcoin, a Visa prepaid card, and a free rewards program. 
Intellectual Property
We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of federal, state, and common law rights in the United States and other countries, as well as on contractual measures. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality, non-disclosure, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with other third parties, in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary technology. In addition to these contractual measures, we also rely on a combination of trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, registered domain names, trade secrets, and patent rights to help protect our brand and our other intellectual property.
We have developed a patent program and strategy to identify, apply for, and secure patents for innovative aspects of our products, services, and technologies where appropriate. As of December 31, 2018, we had 528 issued patents in force and 625 filed patent applications pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions relating to a variety of aspects of our technology. Our issued patents in force will expire between 2022 and 2042. We intend to file additional patent applications as we continue to innovate through our research and development efforts and to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we deem it beneficial and cost-effective.
We actively pursue registration of our trademarks, logos, service marks, trade dress, and domain names in the United States and in other jurisdictions. We are the registered holder of a variety of U.S. and international domain names that include the terms “Square,” "Caviar," "Cash," "Weebly," and variations thereof.
From time to time, we also incorporate certain intellectual property licensed from third parties, including under certain open source licenses. Even if any such third-party technology did not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we believe that alternative technologies would be available as needed in every case.
Government Regulation
Foreign and domestic laws and regulations apply to many key aspects of our business. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation, regulatory or governmental investigations, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions, civil and criminal liability, and constraints on our ability to continue to operate. It is also possible that current or future laws or regulations could be interpreted or applied in a manner that would prohibit, alter, or impair our existing or planned products and services, or that could require costly, time-consuming, or otherwise burdensome compliance measures from us. 
Payments Regulation
Various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the United States and globally. For example, certain jurisdictions in the United States require a license to offer money transmission services, such as our peer-to-peer payments product, Cash App, and we maintain a license in each of those jurisdictions and comply with new license requirements as they arise. We are also registered as a “Money Services Business” with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These licenses and registrations subject us, among other things, to record-keeping requirements, reporting 
13

requirements, bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and inspection by state and federal regulatory agencies.
Outside the United States, we provide localized versions of some of our services to customers, including through various foreign subsidiaries. For example, in Canada, Japan, and Australia, Square Point of Sale is the sole payments service we offer. In the United Kingdom, we offer Square Point of Sale and Cash App. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may be, supervised by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. For instance, we are registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), as required by anti-money laundering rules, to provide payments services in Australia, and we are licensed as an Electronic Money Institution by the Financial Conduct Authority to provide payments services and electronic money in the United Kingdom. 
Our payments services may be or become subject to regulation by other authorities, and the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are always subject to interpretation and change.
Consumer Financial Protection
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other federal, local, state, and foreign regulatory agencies regulate financial products, including credit, deposit, and payments services, and other similar services. These agencies have broad consumer protection mandates, and they promulgate, interpret, and enforce rules and regulations that affect our business.
Anti-Money Laundering
We are subject to anti-money laundering (AML) laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. We have implemented an AML program designed to prevent our payments network from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activity. Our program is also designed to prevent our network from being used to facilitate business in countries, or with persons or entities, included on designated lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls and equivalent applicable foreign authorities. Our AML compliance program includes policies, procedures, reporting protocols, and internal controls, including the designation of an AML compliance officer, and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and to assist in managing risk associated with money laundering and terrorist financing.
Protection and Use of Information
We collect and use a wide variety of information for various purposes in our business, including to help ensure the integrity of our services and to provide features and functionality to our customers. This aspect of our business, including the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of the information we acquire from our own services as well as from third-party sources, is subject to laws and regulations in the United States, the European Union, and elsewhere. Accordingly, we publish our privacy policies and terms of service, which describe our practices concerning the use, transmission, and disclosure of information. As our business continues to expand in the United States and worldwide, and as laws and regulations continue to be passed and their interpretations continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions, additional laws and regulations may become relevant to us.
Communications Regulation
We send texts, emails, and other communications in a variety of contexts, such as when providing digital receipts. Communications laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission, apply to certain aspects of this activity in the United States and elsewhere.
Additional Developments
Various regulatory agencies in the United States and elsewhere in our international markets continue to examine a wide variety of issues that could impact our business, including products liability, import and export compliance, accessibility for the disabled, insurance, marketing, privacy, data protection, information security, and labor and employment matters. As our business continues to develop and expand, additional rules and regulations may become relevant. For example, if we choose to offer Square Payroll in more jurisdictions, additional regulations, including tax rules, will apply.
Seasonality
14

Historically our transaction-based revenue has been strongest in our fourth quarter and weakest in our first quarter, as our sellers typically generate additional GPV during the holiday season. Subscription and services-based revenue generally demonstrates less seasonality than transaction-based revenue. Hardware revenue generally demonstrates less seasonality than transaction-based revenue, with most fluctuations tied to periodic product launches, promotions, or other arrangements with our retail partners. We have not historically experienced meaningful seasonality with respect to total net revenue as this effect has been offset by our revenue growth. No individual quarter in 2018 or 2017 accounted for more than 30% of annual total net revenue.
Our Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 3,349 full-time employees. We also engage temporary employees and consultants as needed to support our operations. None of our employees are either represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
