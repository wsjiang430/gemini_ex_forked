INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS During 2019, we generated 57 percent of our consolidated sales in markets outside of the United States of America (U.S.), with principal international operations in Western Europe and Asia. We also operate manufacturing and distribution facilities in Israel, Latin America and South Africa, while serving customers through sales offices, agents and distributors in Eastern Europe and other parts of the world. While geographic diversification helps to minimize the sales and earnings effect of demand changes in any one particular region, our international operations are subject to normal risks of doing business globally, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in social, political and economic environments.
Our international assets and sales are presented in Note 19 of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Further information about the effects and risks of currency exchange rates is presented in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section, set forth in Item 7A of this Annual Report.
STRATEGY AND GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS We continued to make progress on our growth and simplification/modernization initiatives in the following areas in fiscal 2019. 
Growth

• | Continued development and refining of our channel strategy;


• | Introduced new products across our business aimed at improving customer productivity and performance, including HarviTM Ultra 8X, our new tangential milling system, KennaFlow hydraulic frac seats and Road KingTM Xtreme; and


• | Announced a new distribution agreement with Gardner Denver for KennaFlow valve seats

Simplification/modernization

• | Substantially completed our previous phase (FY19 Restructuring Actions) of simplification/modernization restructuring initiative, and


• | Announced FY20 and FY21 Restructuring Actions, which are expected to reduce structural costs, improve operational efficiency and position the Company for long-term profitable growth


◦ | Restructurings and proposed facility closures in fiscal 2020 are currently estimated to deliver annualized savings of $35 million to $40 million and $55 million to $65 million in pre-tax charges;


◦ | Fiscal 2021 proposed restructuring and facility closures expected to deliver annualized savings of $25 million to $30 million and pre-tax charges of $60 million to $75 million through fiscal 2020 and 2021

Operational results in 2019 reflected increasing progress on our simplification/modernization initiatives with earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $2.90, a 20 percent improvement over the prior year results. A key milestone of those initiatives was the recent announcement of the intended closure of four of our facilities, which is expected to drive further structural benefits and improve operational efficiency. Sales in 2019 of $2,375.2 million grew slightly compared to $2,367.9 million in 2018, reflecting a 3 percent increase from organic sales growth offset by unfavorable currency exchange effect of 3 percent. We also continued to gain traction on our growth initiatives in general engineering and aerospace, with aerospace growing 12 percent. Against this backdrop of year-over-year progress, we saw increased softening in most of our end-markets late in the year. Our expectation is that this challenging macro environment will continue into the first half of fiscal 2020. Nevertheless, we expect to continue executing our plan to improve long-term profitability.
ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES We continually evaluate new opportunities to expand existing product lines into new market areas, and to introduce new and/or complementary product offerings into new or existing areas where appropriate. In the near term, we expect to continue to grow our business and further enhance our market position through the investment opportunities that exist within our core businesses, though we may evaluate acquisition opportunities that have the potential to strengthen or expand our business.
RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES Our major metallurgical raw materials consist of tungsten ore concentrates and scrap carbide, which are used to make tungsten oxide, as well as compounds and secondary materials such as cobalt. Although an adequate supply of these raw materials currently exists, our major sources for raw materials are located abroad and prices fluctuate at times. We have entered into extended raw material supply agreements and expect to implement product price increases as necessary to mitigate rising costs. For these reasons, we exercise great care in selecting, purchasing and managing availability of raw materials. We also purchase steel bars and forgings for making toolholders and other tool parts, as well as for producing mining tools, rotary cutting tools and accessories. We purchase products for use in manufacturing processes and for resale from thousands of suppliers located in the U.S. and abroad. Our internal capabilities provide access to additional sources of raw materials and offer tungsten carbide recycling capabilities, and therefore, help mitigate our reliance on third parties.
5

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) Our R&D efforts focus on delivering innovations to our customers from both new product and process technology development. New product development provides solutions to our customers’ manufacturing challenges and productivity requirements. New process technology is developed and implemented in-house as part of our simplification/modernization efforts to enhance product quality and efficiency at our plant sites. We use a disciplined framework, and have established “gates,” or sequential tests to remove inefficiencies and accelerate commercial success. This framework is designed to acclerate and streamline development into a series of actions and decision points, integrating resource tasks to implement new and enhanced products and process technologies faster. It is designed to assure a strong linkage between verified customer requirements and corporate strategy, and to enable us to gain the full benefits of our investment in development work.
We hold a number of patents and trademarks which, in the aggregate, are material to the operation of our businesses. The duration of our patent protection varies throughout the world by jurisdiction. 
SEASONALITY Our business is affected by seasonal variations to varying degrees by traditional summer vacation shutdowns of customers’ plants and holiday shutdowns that affect our sales levels during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year.
BACKLOG Our backlog of orders generally is not significant to our operations.
COMPETITION As one of the world’s leading producers of tooling and metalworking products, specialty wear-resistant components and ceramics, earth cutting tools and advanced metallurgical powders, we maintain a leading competitive position in major markets worldwide. We actively compete in the sale of all our products with several large global competitors and with many smaller niche businesses offering various capabilities to customers around the world. While several of our competitors are divisions of larger corporations, our industry remains largely fragmented, containing several hundred fabricators, toolmakers and niche specialty coating businesses. Many of our competitors operate relatively small facilities, producing a limited selection of tools while buying cemented tungsten carbide components from original producers of cemented tungsten carbide products, including Kennametal. We also supply coating solutions and other engineered wear-resistant products to both larger corporations and smaller niche businesses. Given the fragmentation, opportunities for consolidation exist from both U.S.-based and internationally-based firms, as well as among thousands of industrial supply distributors.
The principal competitive differentiators in our businesses include customer focused support and application expertise, custom and standard product innovation, product performance and quality and our brand recognition. We derive competitive advantage from our premium brand positions, global presence, application expertise and ability to address unique customer needs with new and improved tools, innovative surface and wear-resistant solutions, highly engineered components, consistent quality, traditional and digital customer service and technical assistance capabilities, state-of-the-art manufacturing and multiple sales channels. With these strengths, we are able to sell products based on the value-added productivity we deliver to our customers, rather than competing solely on price.
REGULATION From time to time, we are a party to legal claims and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, which may relate to our operations or assets, including real, tangible, or intellectual property assets. While we currently believe that the amount of ultimate liability, if any, we may face with respect to these actions will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain. Were an unfavorable outcome to occur or if protracted litigation were to ensue, the effect on us could be material.
Compliance with government laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials or pollutants into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position for the years covered by this Annual Report, nor is such compliance expected to have a material effect on us in the future.
The operation of our business has exposed us to certain liabilities and compliance costs related to environmental matters. We are involved in various environmental cleanup and remediation activities at certain of our locations.
We establish and maintain reserves for certain potential environmental issues. At June 30, 2019 and 2018, the balances of these reserves were $12.4 million and $12.6 million, respectively. These reserves represent anticipated costs associated with the remediation of these issues and are generally not discounted.
6

The reserves we have established for environmental liabilities represent our best current estimate of the costs of addressing all identified environmental situations, based on our review of currently available evidence, and taking into consideration our prior experience in remediation and that of other companies, as well as public information released by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), other governmental agencies and by the Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) groups in which we are participating. Although the reserves currently appear to be sufficient to cover these environmental liabilities, there are uncertainties associated with environmental liabilities, and we can give no assurance that our estimate of any environmental liability will not increase or decrease in the future. The reserved and unreserved liabilities for all environmental concerns could change substantially due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination, changes in remedial requirements, technological changes, discovery of new information, the financial strength of other PRPs, the identification of new PRPs and the involvement of and direction taken by the government on these matters.
Among other environmental laws, we are subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (Superfund), under which we have been designated by the USEPA as a PRP with respect to environmental remedial costs at certain Superfund sites. We have evaluated our claims and potential liability associated with these Superfund sites based upon the best information currently available to us. We believe our environmental accruals will be adequate to cover our portion of the environmental remedial costs at those Superfund sites where we have been designated a PRP, to the extent these expenses are probable and reasonably estimable.
EMPLOYEES We employed approximately 10,400 people at June 30, 2019, of which approximately 3,400 were located in the U.S. and 7,000 were located in other parts of the world, principally Germany, India and China. At June 30, 2019, approximately 3,100 of our employees were represented by labor unions. We consider our labor relations to be generally good.

RISK FACTORS
This section describes material risks to our business that are currently known to us. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially affected by a number of factors. Our management regularly monitors the risks inherent in our business, with input from our Enterprise Risk Management process. In addition to real time monitoring, we periodically conduct a formal enterprise-wide risk assessment to identify factors and circumstances that might present significant risk to the Company. Many of these risks are discussed throughout this report. The risks below, however, are not exhaustive. We operate in a rapidly changing environment. Other risks that we currently believe to be immaterial could become material in the future. We are also subject to legal and regulatory changes. New factors could emerge, and it is not possible to predict the outcome of all such risk factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The following discussion details the material risk factors and uncertainties that we believe could cause Kennametal’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.
Downturns in the business cycle could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Our business has historically been cyclical and subject to significant impact from economic downturns. Global economic downturns coupled with global financial and credit market disruptions have had a negative effect on our sales and profitability historically. These events could contribute to weak end markets, a sharp drop in demand for our products and services and higher costs of borrowing and/or diminished credit availability. Although we believe that the long-term prospects for our business remain positive, we are unable to predict the future course of industry variables or the strength and pace or sustainability of economic development. 
7

Our restructuring efforts may not have the intended effects. We are implementing restructuring and other actions to reduce structural costs, improve operational efficiency and position the Company for long-term profitable growth. However, there is no assurance that these efforts, or that any other actions that we have taken or may take in the future, will be sufficient to counter any future economic or industry disruptions. We cannot provide assurance that we will not incur additional restructuring charges or impairment charges, or that we will achieve all of the anticipated benefits from the restructuring actions we have taken, are taking now, or plan to take in the future. If we are unable to effectively restructure our operations in light of evolving market conditions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our simplification/modernization initiative began in fiscal 2017. The purpose of this initiative is to invest in our plants, equipment and processes to automate and lower our overall labor cost. These capital investments have resulted in savings and are expected to result in further savings from reduced labor, maintenance and supply costs, while at the same time improving the quality of our products. We cannot provide any assurances that we will achieve all of the anticipated savings from these planned actions. These initiatives are expected to put pressure on our cash flows for the near-term. If we are unable to effectively execute our plans, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our international operations pose certain risks that may adversely effect sales and earnings. We have manufacturing operations and assets located outside of the U.S., including but not limited to those in Western Europe, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Israel and South Africa. We also sell our products to customers and distributors located outside of the U.S. During the year ended June 30, 2019, 57 percent of our consolidated sales were derived from non-U.S. markets. These international operations are subject to a number of special risks, in addition to the risks of our domestic operations, including currency exchange rate fluctuations, differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, overlap of different tax regimens, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulations, labor unrest, risk of governmental expropriation, domestic and foreign customs and tariffs, current and changing regulatory environments (including, but not limited to, the risks associated with the importation and exportation of products and raw materials), risk of failure of our foreign employees to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust laws, trade regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, difficulty in obtaining distribution support, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differences in the availability and terms of financing, social and political instability and unrest and risks of increased taxes and/or adverse tax consequences. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. To the extent we are unable to effectively manage our international operations and these risks, our international sales may be adversely affected, we may be subject to additional and unanticipated costs, and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory action. As a consequence, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.
Additional tax expense or exposures could affect our financial condition and results of operations.  We are subject to various taxes in the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in our effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, and the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures.
Implementation of new tariffs and changes to or uncertainties related to tariffs and trade agreements could adversely affect our business. The U.S. has recently announced the implementation of certain new tariffs on steel, aluminum and other raw materials imported into the country and may also consider additional tariffs. In response, certain foreign governments have implemented or are reportedly considering implementing additional tariffs on U.S. goods. In addition, there have been recent changes to trade agreements. Uncertainties with respect to tariffs, trade agreements or any potential trade wars could negatively effect the global economic markets and could affect demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in tariffs could also result in changes in supply and demand of our raw material needs and could affect our manufacturing capabilities and could lead to increased prices that we may not be able to effectively pass on to customers, each of which could materially adversely affect our operating margins, results of operations and cash flows.

Changes in the regulatory environment, including environmental, health and safety regulations, could subject us to increased compliance and manufacturing costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Health and Safety Regulations. Certain of our products contain hard metals, including tungsten and cobalt. Hard metal dust is being studied for potential adverse health effects by organizations in several regions throughout the world, including the U.S., Europe and Japan. Future studies on the health effects of hard metals may result in our products being classified as hazardous to human health, which could lead to new regulations in countries in which we operate that may restrict or prohibit the use of, and/or exposure to, hard metal dust. New regulation of hard metals could require us to change our operations, and these changes could affect the quality of our products and materially increase our costs.
Environmental Regulations. We are subject to various environmental laws, and any violation of, or our liabilities under, these laws could adversely affect us. Our operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges to air and water, handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for noncompliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or exposure to, hazardous materials. We could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under these laws. We may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future. If more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Regulations affecting the mining and drilling industries or utilities industry. Some of our principal customers are mining and drilling companies. Many of our mining and drilling customers supply coal, oil, gas or other fuels as a source of energy to utility companies in the U.S. and other industrialized regions. The operations of these mining and drilling companies are geographically diverse and are subject to or affected by a wide array of regulations in the jurisdictions where they operate, such as applicable environmental laws and regulations governing the mining and drilling industry and the utilities industry. As a result of changes in regulations and laws relating to these industries, our customers’ operations could be disrupted or curtailed by governmental authorities. The high cost of compliance with these regulations may also induce customers to discontinue or limit their operations and may discourage companies from developing new opportunities. As a result of these factors, demand for our mining- and drilling-related products could be substantially affected by regulations adversely effecting the mining and drilling industries or altering the consumption patterns of utilities. 
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives could result in a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At June 30, 2019, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $314.6 million, or 12 percent of our total assets. Goodwill results from acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. We assess at least annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our continued success depends on our ability to protect and defend our intellectual property. Our future success depends in part upon our ability to protect and defend our intellectual property. We rely principally on nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements and trade secret laws and, to a lesser extent, trademark and patent laws, to protect our intellectual property. However, these measures may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property from infringement by others or prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. If one of our patents is infringed upon by a third party, we may need to devote significant time and financial resources to defend our rights with respect to such patent. We may not be successful in defending our patents. Similarly, while we do not knowingly infringe on the patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others, we may be required to spend a significant amount of time and financial resources to resolve any infringement claims against us, and we may not be successful in defending our position or negotiating alternative remedies. Our inability to protect our proprietary information and enforce or defend our intellectual property rights in proceedings initiated by us or brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Failure of, or a breach in security of, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. We rely on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives. Any disruption of our infrastructure could negatively effect our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Any disruption could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate.
9

In recent years, cybersecurity attacks have become more sophisticated and more prevalent. A security breach of our information technology systems could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation. In addition, we could be subject to liability if confidential information relating to customers, employees, vendors and the extended supply chain or other parties is misappropriated from our computer system. We do not believe we have been the target of a material successful cyber attack. While we have dedicated increased resources to fortify our security measures, our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, human error, programming errors or similar disruptive problems. Therefore, we cannot assure that our system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any cyber attack or network disruption.
We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our domestic and foreign operations are subject to significant competitive pressures. We compete directly and indirectly with other manufacturers and suppliers of metalworking tools, engineered components and advanced materials. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater access to financial resources or be less leveraged than us. In addition, the industry in which our products are used is a large, fragmented industry that is highly competitive.
If we are unable to retain our qualified management and employees, our business may be negatively affected. Our ability to provide high quality products and services depends in part on our ability to retain our skilled personnel in the areas of management, product engineering, servicing and sales. Competition for such personnel is intense, and our competitors can be expected to attempt to hire our management and skilled employees from time to time. In addition, our restructuring activities and strategies for growth have placed, and are expected to continue to place, increased demands on our management’s skills and resources. If we are unable to retain our management team and professional personnel, our customer relationships and level of technical expertise could be negatively affected, which may materially and adversely affect our business.
Any interruption of our workforce, including interruptions due to our restructuring initiatives, unionization efforts, changes in labor relations or shortages of appropriately skilled individuals could effect our business. 
Our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the prices and availability of raw materials. The raw materials we use for our products include tungsten ore concentrates and scrap carbide, which are used to make tungsten oxide, as well as compounds and secondary materials such as cobalt. A significant portion of our raw materials is supplied by sources outside of the U.S. The raw materials extraction industry is highly cyclical and at times pricing and supply can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including natural disasters, general economic and political conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs and currency exchange rate fluctuations. This volatility can significantly affect our raw material costs. In an environment of increasing raw material prices, competitive conditions can affect how much of these price increases we can recover in the form of higher sales prices for our products. To the extent we are unable to pass on any raw material price increases to our customers, our profitability could be adversely affected. Furthermore, restrictions in the supply of tungsten, cobalt and other raw materials could adversely affect our operating results. If the prices for our raw materials increase or we are unable to secure adequate supplies of raw materials on favorable terms, our profitability could be impaired. If the prices for our raw materials decrease, we could face product pricing challenges.
Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business. The sale of metalworking, mining, highway construction and other tools and related products as well as engineered components and advanced materials entails an inherent risk of product liability claims. We cannot give any assurances that the coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate or that our policies will cover any particular loss. Insurance can be expensive, and we may not always be able to purchase insurance on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Claims brought against us that are not covered by insurance or that result in recoveries in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may not be able to complete, manage or integrate acquisitions successfully. We have acquired companies in the past and we may continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that have the potential strengthen or expand our business. We can give no assurances, however, that any acquisition opportunities will arise or if they do, that they will be consummated, or that additional financing, if needed, will be available on satisfactory terms. In addition, acquisitions involve inherent risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with our expectations. We may not be able to achieve the synergies and other benefits we expect from the integration of acquisitions as successfully or rapidly as projected, if at all. Our failure to consummate an acquisition or effectively integrate newly acquired operations could prevent us from realizing our expected strategic growth and rate of return on an acquired business and could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
10

Natural disasters or other global or regional catastrophic events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect results. Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions to us through business continuity planning, we still may be exposed to interruptions due to catastrophe, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism or acts of war, which are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely effect our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and stock price could be adversely affected.
