ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 We provide innovative and sustainable transportation solutions that help people move seamlessly within cities.
 Our journey began with e-scooters in Italy in 2018, and today we have evolved into a multi-modal micro-mobility ecosystem offering micro-mobility electric vehicles, while continuing to push boundaries, lead innovation and set new standards in our space. We are changing how people move from A-to-B, allowing users to unlock vehicles on demand with a tap of a button from their smartphone. From being an early mover in Italy and educating users on this new technology, we have today evolved into a multi-modal micro-mobility ecosystem.
 We believe that cities should be for people and living and not for cars, congestion and pollution. We intend to do our part for a greener tomorrow and take responsibility for our environmental, societal and governance impact as we continue to make the cities we operate in more livable by connecting their residents with more frictionless, affordable, and convenient transportation alternatives. We pride ourselves on goal of becoming 100% carbon neutral and helping to shift behavior in our cities. We believe that the world is on the verge of a shift away from car ownership with people looking for alternative ways to travel with ease, beat congestion and benefit our planet.
 Shared micro-mobility vehicles have the potential to transform how people move around cities and interact with existing infrastructure. We continue our effort to make Helbiz a natural extension of the current city infrastructure. This helps city planners transform their communities and integrate Helbiz services into the public transportation networks as a seamless and integrated door-to-door solution. Strengthening our intermodal offering and depth of our mobility ecosystem can not only help reduce the dependency on cars, whether private or taxi, but also drastically limit congestion and pollution and enhance well-being in our cities.
 We have become an integrated part of our local communities. We offer our user base products and services other than our vehicles, from transit integration to home deliveries of meals cooked in our restaurant to media content on our app, to deepen our consumer relationship and experience, and intend to increase our offerings of new products and services. Through our recent acquisition of Wheels Labs, Inc., we now offer individuals the opportunities to rent on a monthly basis or to purchase our proprietary sit-down scooters, Wheels One.
 In developing our business, our focus has always been operations and scalability first. Instead of scaling an unsustainable business like some of our competitors, our early investments were centered around our platform, infrastructure and creating the operational efficiencies necessary to grow our business globally. We have established a strong scalable network and technology infrastructure that powers millions of rides, users, and vehicles on a daily basis. We are levering our platform and reach to continue improve the efficiency and the quality of our offerings and deepen the relationship our users have with us.
 We anticipate demand for our services will continue to grow as our multimodal offerings and verticals grow and deepen our influence, integration and impact in local markets. Our operational excellence, local collaboration, innovation focused execution and optimization has positioned us as one of the operational market leaders in the space continuing to push boundaries and technological advancements.
 Our Advantage
 In a fast-moving industry, we believe that we have proven our ability to adapt and evolve without jeopardizing the timing, quality, and quantity of the service through our agile and well-run structure.
 Unlike many of our competitors, our approach in our early days was future-focused as opposed to generating short-term revenues and unsustainable growth. This approach, paired with our values, tools and teams, has put us in a position to operate in the micro-mobility market in a way that we believe our competitors cannot. We believe that, among other reasons, the future belongs to Helbiz based on the following strengths:
 

1
-


•        A well-known brand with deep market penetration
 Since we began what we believe is Italy’s first ever shared e-scooter rental in Milan in 2018, we have grown significantly, and we have become a substantial Italian micro-mobility operator, based on number of licenses and electric vehicles authorized. In the past two years we have expanded our presence in the U.S. market and currently have licenses to operate in more than 13 U.S. cities and universities. In August 2021, we became the first micro-mobility company to list on a major U.S. stock exchange.
 •        A New Regulatory Landscape — that favors conscientious operators
 The early days of the micro-mobility space was characterized by no licenses or regulations, favoring well-financed companies with the ability to dump tens of thousands of vehicles in every market without any concern on how to manage their fleets, utilizations or earnings. Companies burned significant funds to be able to maximize the quantity of vehicles and left broken and uncharged vehicles littered throughout the streets.
 Over the last few years, a drastic regulatory shift has occurred. Cities have put a cap on the number of micro-mobility operators in a city. To further prevent saturation and improve quality, many of the cities in which we operate have also capped the number of vehicles per micro-mobility provider. We believe that these caps level the playing field between operators by taking away funding as a competitive advantage and instead shifting the focus from quantity to quality of service in an open bidding — which favors conscientious operators with a core dedication to collaborating with the city granting the license.
 Quality of service has been our main focus since our inception. We solely rely on in-house teams for transparency and effective work.
 •        A Global hyper local approach — our proven relationship with cities we operate in
 We view each city or university in which we operate through the lens of a partnership between us and that city or university. By focusing on this partnership, we believe that we will be able to provide a sustainable solution to the city’s or university’s reliance on cars. We take a city-first approach to tailor the services that we offer and how we offer them. From our inception, we have been focused on serving cities the right way, guaranteeing, and upholding our high standards while maximizing utilization and vehicle distribution. We harness the global power and support of an extensive operational, technological and customer support team optimized for a hyper local approach that deeply connects with cities, communities, and customers on a daily basis. We have built a scalable and versatile platform focused on our ability to fully customize our offering in each individual market to cover the unique needs of every city or university. When we enter a market, we do so as a partner of the local municipality more than a service provider. We take ownership of the communities that we serve and aspire to seamlessly integrate within the existing infrastructure for long-term collaboration. The local quality focus approach sets us apart with customers and cities. We hire and train locally and mainly use dedicated in-house teams throughout operations to properly guarantee our service, reliability, and accountability down to the smallest detail while directly representing our company in the local communities every day. In a regulatory landscape that focus on quality and community, our approach, that is in direct contrast to many of our competitors’ independent contractor model, has seen us gain favor of local municipalities.
  •        Multiple activities generating revenues — Less dependent on operational income derived from our micro-mobility services
 We have built our platform around several activities and initiatives that generate revenues such as co-branding, advertisement, partnerships, subscriptions, trips, meals and media content. This has allowed us to grow and optimize our business while being less dependent on operational income and maintaining service at an affordable price point in a competitive industry.
 •        Cutting Edge Technology — Our proprietary technology platform
 Our proprietary technology platform includes a custom-built ecosystem of tools, software and hardware for both our consumers and for our operations servicing our vehicles to promote transparency, integration and operational efficiencies. Our technology suite allows us to properly manage, scale, optimize and tailor our offering for each individual market and to rapidly launch new products to serve our cities and customers.

We also have a proprietary vehicle, Wheels One, a sit-down scooter, which we intend to continue to manufacture and rent on a monthly basis or sell to users.
 •        An Exceptional Customer Experience
 We have built our platform and experience around our customers from the beginning.
 •        Use of Strategic Partnerships — to drive new users and increase adoption
 To further enhance and grow our presence in local markets, we actively focus on partnering with local and national market leaders to expose our fleet and platform to millions of our partners’ existing clients. We have formed partnerships with several players that allow us to tap into existing user bases to quickly boost ridership and credibility when entering new markets. In new markets, strong local partners also help us tap into existing governmental relationships to expedite license processes. Carefully chosen strategic partnerships help us escalate the ability to scale while significantly improving brand awareness and image, linking us to strong and reliable businesses.
 •        An Innovative Multimodal Platform — broadened reach, value proposition and city integration
 Our multimodal platform offers customers a variety of transportation options on-demand. In 2021, we launched e-mopeds and e-bikes in addition to our e-scooters, to serve different demographics and needs, and we are working on seamlessly integrating public transit to enable riders to optimize their trips across all available offering based on their criteria and preferences. We continue our effort to make Helbiz a natural extension of the current city infrastructure which helps city planners transform their communities and integrate Helbiz services into the public transportation networks of every city becoming a seamless and integrated door-to-door solution for our riders.

•        Our food preparation and delivery offering. 
 In July 2021, we launched Helbiz Kitchen, our service through which users can order food for delivery through our mobile app. We will capture all of the revenues from such orders by preparing the food to be ordered in a ghost kitchen and having it delivered by our own drivers using our e-vehicles. Our pilot ghost kitchen is in an approximately 21,500 square foot facility in Milan, Italy that provides six menus centered on pizzas, hamburgers, salads, poke, sushi and ice cream. In keeping with our ethos of providing eco-friendly offerings, our pilot ghost kitchen has an all-electric kitchen and uses biodegradable containers, utensils and packaging in our deliveries instead of plastics. In February 2023, we opened our first Helbiz Kitchen in the United States in Santa Monica, California with plans to open the second U.S. location in Los Angeles, California in the coming weeks.
 •        Our in-house operations teams.
 Unlike many other micro-mobility companies, we employ in-house operations teams in each market in which we operate rather than hiring outside third-party contractors to maintain our fleets. This operations team oversees all aspects of fleet maintenance, from charging and repairing to deploying each morning, redeploying throughout the day and picking up at night. We believe that this provides a higher quality of fleet maintenance and protects our brand by creating a uniform user experience no matter what city the user is in.
 •        A visionary founder led company — Our management team.
 
We are led by a management team with experience in developing emerging growth companies. Several executive officers have years of experience in consumer-facing industries.

Our Market Opportunity
 Societal, industrial, and technological changes are shifting how we move, and they are transforming the mass-transportation market. Transportation is among the largest household expenditures. We believe that we are in the early phase of capturing this opportunity and that use of our micro-mobility platform will, among other factors, continue to grow due to:
 •        Increasing Urban Population
 We believe that the trend of urbanization amongst young professionals is a large opportunity for the micro-mobility industry as it specifically addresses first- and last-mile transport and connects users with the existing infrastructure. For city dwellers, shared e-scooters represent a viable and affordable means of daily transportation. Several consequences resulting from urbanization, such as congested roadways, heightened carbon footprints and limited parking spaces, are directly mitigated by micro-mobility solutions. Over half of the world’s population today lives in urban areas, according to United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. With increasingly congested roadways and traffic speeds in many city centers averaging as little as 10 miles per hour, people are looking for transportation alternatives. Micro-mobility solutions offer people living in, and visiting, these cities potential benefits, including higher average speeds, less time spent waiting or parking, a lower cost of ownership, and the health benefits of being outdoors, among others.
  •        The Rise of New First- and Last-Mile Options
 From a consumer’s perspective, first- and last-mile transportation in congested cities can be inconvenient and costly when using traditional modes of transportation such as mass transit or personal vehicles, as well as when using ride sharing. New shared transportation modes are drastically improving the consumer’s experience, enabling riders to optimize across preferences including cost, comfort, and time.
 We believe these changes happening on a societal and technological level, are creating the foundation for a transportation shift and a reduction in car dependency in the long run that will be substituted with Transportation as a Service (“TaaS”).
 •        Popularity of On-Demand Services
 Consumers have grown to love and appreciate having their world on demand and now expect to be able to access any product or service instantly on their terms and at their convenience. Older generations are transitioning and adopting to new technology faster than before, while younger generations are raised as digital natives. On-demand services are now an essential part of daily life and consumers prioritize intuitive and user-friendly platforms that make their lives easier.
 •       Urban Planners are Addressing the Issue of Congestion
 Micro-mobility is good for city planning, taking up less space for roads and parking, and complementing mass transit schemes while creating more connected communities. Cities are addressing the issue of how to deal with peak transportation demand. Limited capacity causes congestion and one solution is to allow micro-mobility to support transportation demand peaks. Modern urban planners are actively looking for providers of micro-mobility solutions, are increasingly dedicating lanes to certain micro-mobility vehicles and are repurposing car parking to micro-mobility spaces.
•        Increased Environmental Awareness
 We believe that cities across the world and their residents are increasing their environmental awareness and actively taking steps to reduce their carbon footprint. As such, we believe that e-scooters, e-bicycles and e-mopeds, if approached in a sustainable, collaborative and safe manner with the cities where they operate, provide a feasible solution to this issue by replacing cars for first- and last-mile transport.
 E-vehicles are green, efficient, and cheap and people are becoming increasingly conscious of the impact that their day-to-day actions have on the environment. Furthermore, they provide individuals with an opportunity to reduce their carbon footprints. According to a 2019 article in the Financial Times, a micro-mobility vehicle has a carbon footprint per mile of 28g compared to 292g for a full-sized vehicle.
 In a world with scarce resources, we are devoted to make the best use of them. We believe that one of the most inefficient ways to go to point A to point B in a city is by car. Most of the car’s energy is used to move the weight of the car itself and not the weight of its occupants.

•        Hyper-Vertical Super App Trend Provides an Opportunity to Enhance our Platform’s Value
 The hyper-vertical platform model, a variety of the super-app model adopted in Asia, focuses on covering the entire customer journey around a singular product or vertical. We see potential in the long term to gradually add services on top of our existing platform related to urban mobility that will enhance our customer experience when moving around cities and deepen the customers’ engagement while creating added value across services.
Our Platform
 Helbiz is built around four pillars: a growing and engaging network, cutting-edge technology, operational superiority and service focus.
 A Growing and Engaging Network
 
Helbiz has developed a growing network of millions of riders, vehicles, trips, drivers and their underlying data, technology and infrastructure. The more trips, pickups or user interactions on our network, the more we are able to improve our network, optimize our operations and raise the quality of our services. 
 Our strategy is to leverage our fast and organic growth in the micro-mobility services to onboard customers with the intention of converting them to long-term platform users across verticals and with each additional offering, city, service or vertical aimed at increasing the value proposition and longevity of each user.
 Cutting-Edge Technology
 Seamlessly Integrated Ecosystem
 Helbiz has built a cutting-edge ecosystem of tools, software and hardware for consumers, operations, and drivers to ensure complete transparency, integration and operational efficiencies. Instead of relying on a variety of limited third-party solutions, every tool we use is meticulously crafted in-house in conjunction with each other to create a symbiotic ecosystem that was specifically built around our operations, practices and needs. The result is a robust and highly functional framework with total operational control. Our main mobile platforms are our Helbiz app for consumers and our Helbiz Driver App for operational drivers managing our fleet. Both platforms are built on our proprietary “Core Platform Engine”. To power our operations, we built a suite of operational tools including our Helbiz Drive App, warehouse and inventory management and analytics, prediction algorithms and dispatch engine. Our entire ecosystem is fully implemented and operational globally.
Core Platform Engine
 •        Utilization & Prediction
 Using real time and historical data, our technology helps us predict demand throughout the day and week to help us balance supply and demand and maintain optimal vehicle distribution and rebalancing. We believe that this leads to higher customer satisfaction while significantly minimizing operational costs.
 •        Dispatching & Matching Engine
 Our proprietary dispatch engine and algorithms overlook and manage our global fleet of operational drivers globally, autonomously sending tasks, priorities, and routes to each Driver in real-time. In each instance, our algorithms review and consider multiple variables including vehicles, batteries, drivers, warehouses, distances, traffic, locations, inventory as well as utilization prediction and current status. Our dispatch engine is automatically responding to alerts or customer issues dispatching the nearest driver. We designed this system to ensure driver productivity, efficiency and a seamless operation.
 •        Geofencing
 Using geofencing technology we can properly manage and remotely control our vehicles in accordance with government regulations. We implement a variety of virtual zones in our cities which automatically communicate with and control the setting of our vehicles to prevent clutter, irresponsible usage, and parking by controlling maximum speed, acceleration and disabling the throttle or the entering selected areas such as pedestrian zones or parks.

•        Parking Verifications
 Using our proprietary technology, we are able to create virtual parking zones where customers are directed to pick up and leave our e-vehicles.
  •        Streaming Technology. 
 Our Helbiz Live app integrates our proprietary technology for the front-end authentication process with that of third-party service providers like Comintech S.r.l., an Italian technology company involved in audiovisual distribution, which will manage the back-end processes like feeds collection, encoding, voiceover, the content management system and the content delivery network.
Payment Technologies
 We have developed a strong and scalable payment infrastructure that includes a variety of trusted payment options serving a diverse and global demographic. Helbiz has integrated payments as a core part of our technology stack, to be able to continue to innovate and expand to broaden the offering and meet the demands of our users, in deep collaboration with strong payment partners from Stripe, Telepass, Tinaba, E-Pay and Alipay. The result is a flexible payment infrastructure that supports all types of users and their preferences from pre-paying to post-paying for each trip or service with any instrument/service of their choice, including credit cards, debit cards, HelbizCash, Telepass, Alipay and cash through local partners.
 In 2019, Helbiz introduced HelbizCash, which is a closed-loop digital wallet allowing customers to add funds upfront, receive rewards and use funds for all services and offerings inside the current and future Helbiz ecosystem as it grows in return for benefits, rewards and incentives.
 Operational Superiority
 A robust and reliable driver network and infrastructure which ensures that vehicles are properly distributed, batteries charged and maintained is the foundation for the customer experience that we offer. We have built a flexible and scalable infrastructure to manage our fleets and drivers globally. Every city we operate in has a local on-ground operations team, drivers with extensive local knowledge and a global support system. Our service and platform are built around our operational experience gained over many years to get the operations right instead of rapidly and prematurely scaling. The long-term success, and profitability, of any micro-mobility operator is directly linked to the quality and efficiency of operations. For that reason, we meticulously built each technology tool used in our operations from scratch including warehouse and inventory management, the Helbiz Drivers App, our Dispatch Engine and management tools. All technology tools and platforms were built to work in conjunction with each other, and carefully selected and trained drivers.
 •        A hyper-local approach, on a global scale
 One of core values is to approach each new city in a hyper-local manner. We hire locals, learn from locals, partner with local companies and interact with communities as a local to properly serve each city the way it should be served. Knowing and interacting with the cities we operate in beyond offering a service is crucial for becoming an integrated part of the local community and our long-term operational success. On a global level, we have built a highly flexible infrastructure that allows our software teams to work with and easily adapt our platform to localized needs of municipalities as a partner, not a service provider. On a local level, we hire locals, who live and breathe the core values of their city, to run our operations where they live.
 •        In-House drivers
 We believe our early success, both with customers and regulators, is directly linked to our commitment to solely hire and utilize in-house teams for our on-ground operations or local partners for specific cities. Utilizing in-house teams or local partners, and not independent contractors like our competitors, allows us to properly train and oversee each worker/partners. To cities and regulators, it means we can provide consistent service, respond to issues in real time, be fully accountable, work hand in hand with regulators and have our workers as an extension of our brand in the communities without relying on unscreened third-party workers and the uncertainties that come with such.

•        Support System
 The cornerstone of our company and experience is our highly-rated customer experience. We have invested and trained our own Micro-Mobility support center that supports our drivers. All drivers are trained in their individual cities, monitored during shifts and have access to our Operational Managers should they need additional help. A reliable service starts with the support system we can offer our teams on the ground.
Service Focus
 We provide our services with a care and focus that we believe sets us apart in our journey to power movement at scale in a rapidly changing environment. Our experience is built around the frictionless interaction between our software, our hardware and our cities and relies on our key points: agility, simplicity, and continued innovation.
 •        Experienced focused agility
 We are built around a strong core software team that has built our software eco-system from scratch. We aim to provide services that are customer and city focused and have built a highly scalable and flexible infrastructure that allows our teams to rapidly release new features and offerings and adapt to local requirements and needs of local cities.
 •        Intuitive simplicity
 We believe the Helbiz experience and app should be an extension of oneself, seamlessly connecting you with your city in a natural and intuitive way. We transform complexities into a simple platform that is inviting and easy to use while remaining powerful and versatile.
 •        Continuous Innovation
 Our past and future success in a rapidly evolving industry relies on our ability to constantly research, innovate and optimize our vehicles, hardware, and operational tools. We have established a dedicated R&D department that is working directly with our manufactures to improve the riding and operational experience, increase vehicle lifespan and optimize profitability. With our focus on rapid and continuous innovation, Helbiz was among the first companies globally to integrate and utilize geofencing and parking verification technology throughout its operations.
 Benefits of the Helbiz Mobility Platform
 Key Benefits for Users
 Across our mobile platforms and consumer offerings we strive to create an experience that becomes a seamless extension of the user, intuitively creating a convenient, affordable, and reliable experience when interacting with their city.
 •        Convenience
 We crafted the Helbiz app around efficient simplicity that allows a user to unlock their city with a touch of a button. We designed our proprietary technology to provide a convenient and frictionless user experience and well distributed, maintained and charged fleets across a variety of modes to suit the users’ needs. We strive to reduce the friction of moving and to always ensure available vehicles in your vicinity that allow you to beat traffic with ease without the hassle of having to deal with congestion, parking, ownership or cash transactions.
 •        Affordability
 We believe everyone has the right to move freely on their own terms, and have the ability to optimize across cost, time and comfort. Our dockless e-vehicles enable customers to move and connect with their city at a low cost. For commuters and frequent riders, we introduced unlimited subscription plans in the third quart of 2020, allowing users to take unlimited 30-minute e-scooter and e-bike trips for a fixed monthly price, with affordability in mind.

•        Reliability
 Our mission is to be reliable enough to the point where our customers do not need to rely on cars or other modes of transportation or to plan ahead of time. We strive to properly serve cities and maintain e-vehicle density to meet the demand in all areas so that users always have access to a charged vehicle when they need one. Reliability is essential and the reason that we solely rely on in-house teams and drivers in our cities for improved accountability, control and response time for the most reliable customer experience. We aim to continue to improve on our quality, service, offerings and hardware, while accurately optimizing our predict and utilization algorithms and software.
 
Key Benefits for Communities/Cities
 We believe the foundation for our growth and one of the key indicators for our future success is the amount of positive impact we can generate throughout or local communities in the following ways:
 •        Social
 We connect people with their cities and communities, providing easy, fast, and reliable ways to get around directly eliminating the need for cars, private car ownership or parking. Our approach is community first and once we open a city, we engage to become an active part of the local community serving all groups, independent of socioeconomic status. Our Access Program offer discounted and free rides and subscriptions for students and low-income citizens ensuring their right to affordable transportation and freedom to move. Our Relief Rides Program, introduced in 2020, was established to provide free rides and support during national emergencies. During the early phases of COVID-19, we provided healthcare and essential workers in Italy and United States with unlimited free transportation to continue to serve our communities in a safe and reliable way during the lockdown. In April 2021, we offered up to 100,000 free rides on our e-bikes and e-scooters in the Italian cities in which we operate to people who need to go to approved facilities to receive their COVID-19 vaccinations.
 •        Economic — Increased economic well-being and quality of life
 One of the key elements determining the level of economic well-being is the access to transportation and freedom of movement. We are not only offering users flexible and alternative transportation alternatives but are also connecting them with existing transit networks. We pride ourselves on serving all communities in our cities and re-balance our fleet to maintain vehicle density throughout the communities to offer a reliable service at a fair price point. We improve the quality of transportation city wide, helping to reduce transportation inequality, as car-centric mobility networks often exclude lower socio-economic groups.
 •        Environmental — Less congestion, less pollution, more life
 We are bringing life back to our cities by reducing congestion and reducing carbon emissions and pollution all while shifting our dependency on car ownership to TaaS. This promotes the creation of cities designed for people and not cars.

•        Infrastructural — Increased value and connectedness of existing infrastructure
 We are complementing existing city infrastructure and transport networks, directly increasing their value and connectedness, without requiring cities to spend vast number of resources on large scale public transport expansions with marginal return. We provide citizens with reliable alternatives that allows them to connect with the current transit networks where it was previously difficult. We are dedicated to improving upon our infrastructural impact and are exploring how to incorporate public transportation into our platform, to seamlessly be able to serve across multiple means of transportation within a single journey. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we launched a partnership with Trenitalia, the largest train company in Italy, allowing users to purchase, store and redeem train tickets directly inside of the Helbiz platform. In addition to the direct benefits for the city and its citizens, we are helping to create lasting change and cities that are made for living.

Value Proposition for Advertisers
 •        Unique Targeting — Interact with consumers and their environment on the go
 On Helbiz, businesses have a unique opportunity to connect with potential customers through engaging and visual content. We know where all riding users are at all time and can specifically target them the exact second, they are near an advertiser’s location, or any specified location, to create custom experiences that increase real life conversion and engagement with advertisements. Most people seeing an advertisement usually interact with them from the comfort of their home and not when they are on the move in the vicinity.
 •        Valuable Audience — Reach a large conscientious demographic
 Helbiz has a deep reach in the cities where it operates, with support from both government and citizens who are active supporters of our convenient, forward thinking and green initiatives. Through Helbiz, businesses can reach a large unique, savvy, and conscientious demographic when they want and where they want.
 Helbiz is still in the early stages of building our advertising product suite that fully extracts the value of the alignment between users and businesses, but we believe it will be a competitive advantage over the long term as we expand our tools and services.
 •        Environmental — Support and align with a mission for a greener tomorrow
 
The growing importance of sustainability and carbon emissions has been one of the key trends in recent years. Communicating sustainability effectively ranks among the most important aspect of brand strategy across all industries. Helbiz allows businesses to seamlessly integrate into our platform and align with our mission with the ability to communicate their message through our well-respected platform.

The result will be a more connected transportation network that complements current city infrastructure and increases convenience and the engagement of riders with our platform.
 •        Streaming Content. 
 Starting in August 2021, we began providing media content to subscribers to Helbiz Unlimited, our offering that provides unlimited monthly use of our e-scooters and e-bikes for a fixed fee, and through other subscription models. We started streaming content in Italy with the 390 games per season of the Italian Serie B soccer league for the next three seasons, and we are looking to offer these games in other countries where we are present. We are exploring options to sell, reduce or discontinue portions of or all of our Helbiz Live business.
 •        Food for delivery.   
 In July 2021, we launched Helbiz Kitchen, our service through which users can order food that we prepare for delivery through our mobile app. We capture all the revenues from such orders by preparing the food that is ordered in a ghost kitchen and having it delivered by our own drivers using our e-vehicles. Our pilot ghost kitchen operates from an approximately 21,500 square foot facility in Milan, Italy that provides six menus centered on pizzas, hamburgers, salads, poke, sushi and ice cream. We recently opened our first ghost kitchen in the United States.
  The Helbiz Rider Experience
 Our mission is to reshape the transportation industry through innovative and sustainable mobility solutions to create cities made for living that solve the transportation needs of our riders and enable them to reach their destinations quickly, conveniently and affordably. This mission all starts with the Helbiz app, the core part of the Helbiz experience which intuitively connect our users with our vast network of vehicles and platforms. We are determined to provide our users with the best experience and have built a scalable infrastructure that allows us to rapidly add new features, options and platforms.

The Advertisement Experience
 Helbiz users are always on the move and interacting with their local communities. Advertisers have the opportunity to put relevant content in front of them at every stage of this journey. Unlike other ad platforms, Helbiz interacts directly with consumers and their environment while they are on-the-go. We have understood this unique opportunity since our early days, but only begun to fully translate it into a value adding ad product suite in late 2020 as our reach and potential significantly increased.
 A well-integrated and intelligent advertisement experience is one of the cornerstones that allow us to be less dependent on operational revenues and offer a more competitive service globally.
 While we are actively working on expanding our offering and tools it currently includes:


• | Unlock advertisement: which use Helbiz as a digital billboard to show a full screen video message every time a user unlocks a Helbiz vehicle globally, in a specific city or targeted area; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Location based advertisements: which trigger advertisements when a user is in the vicinity of a specific location;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Map branding: which enables companies to sponsor pins, parking spots or specific locations on the map; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Vehicle co-branding: which custom wraps our vehicles for a maximum-visibility, full-takeover campaign, paid per vehicle on a daily basis.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field Operations Excellence 
 Along with vehicle quality and the user app experience, we aim to differentiate our shared mobility service through field operations.  In each city in which we operate, our operation team ensures that our vehicles are properly distributed, charged, maintained and always ready to rent.  In contrast to competitors who fully outsource field operations, resulting in uneven servicing quality and efficiency, Helbiz services each city with a combination of direct employees and some third-party outsourcing.  This level of control is designed to help our operations meet the highest standards of consistency and efficiency.

We direct our field operators through our “Driver App”, which controls and directs the tasks assigned to the team.  Our drivers simply tap ‘Start Shift’ inside the Helbiz Driver app to start a shift. Drivers will automatically start to receive tasks, on-screen instruction, and turn-by-turn navigation to handle their shift and objectives with ease. Every step of the way the driver is guided in an intuitive way to pick up and swap batteries and reposition and maintain vehicles. By tracking every movement, action, route, pickup and drop off, we have an overview of each city’s operation and are able to direct our support teams based on that overview.

Additional app functionality includes the ability to accept/decline tasks, access to real time vehicle data, a support kit and analytics.
 Technology Infrastructure
 We have assembled core product teams with a full-stack development model within a broad range of technical areas to help us power our technology platform and vehicles across the globe and the solve the challenges that arise from delivering reliable services in the physical world in real time. We are tech driven at our core and deploy technical innovations to optimize operations, increase oversight while improving our scalability. We have built a mobile first and platform agnostic suite within the micro-mobility space constituting of a series of proprietary tech platforms and drivers, including operational and analytical and optimizing and decision-making tools, that all operate in conjunction. Every individual component is built on top of our scalable tech stack that enables us to manage spikes in usage and rapidly launch new products, features and services.
 We developed our platform for autonomy, scalability and high accountability. Our success in a fast-moving industry, and relationships with the cities we operate in, is directly linked to our flexibility and development velocity. We currently use third party, AWS, for cloud computing services to help us deliver and host our platform and quickly scale up our services to meet surges in demand and support any product changes we are introducing. We utilize multiple data centers located in the United States and Europe where redundant copies are stored and replicated reliably within each region.
 Sales & Marketing
 Helbiz is marketing its offering to users through brand advertising, direct marketing and fostering rapid adoption through on-street presence and strategic partnerships. We use a variety of broad campaigns from television ads to strategic joint partnerships with strong local brands to promote our platform and extend our service to existing loyal user bases. On a local street level, Helbiz is devoted to a vast amount of educational and community events where we and our engaging team foster deeper connections in the cities we operate in, while our vehicles act as moving billboards for organic user growth. Our direct marketing is made up of promotions, referrals and time-based incentives where we attract consumers through a tailored combination, depending in the city, of sponsored search, targeted social media, push & text notifications and email campaigns. As we grow, we are focused on optimizing and making our marketing & sales spend more effective in attracting high converting users and in encouraging cross vertical spending in a structured and measurable way to significantly enhance customer retention and lifetime value.

Helbiz Media
 We formed Helbiz Media, our wholly-owned subsidiary dedicated to the acquisition and distribution of content over Helbiz Live, a new internally developed app that is separate from our micro-mobility app. From the start, Helbiz Live will be included in our monthly subscription: Helbiz Unlimited, our offering of unlimited monthly e-bike and e-scooter use for a fixed fee, and we may make it available through other subscription models. Helbiz Media’s principal activities will include:

• | Acquiring content. Helbiz Media is charged with acquiring the rights to stream media content on Helbiz Live, with a focus on acquiring the rights to broadcast sporting events. The first content that Helbiz Media has acquired, for the Italian territory, are approximately 390 regular season games in the Italian Serie B soccer league. League Serie B will take care of the TV productions of all matches and will provide the feeds to Helbiz Media. Helbiz Live expanded its content offering (i) in October 2021 by acquiring the rights to broadcast on its app in Italy two live soccer matches per day during the German Cup (DFB-Pokal) and highlights of each round of the German Cup as well as weekly highlights of NFL football games and other NFL branded content (ii) in November 2021 by partnering with ESPN to broadcast on its App in Italy (a) two NCAA college football games and two NCAA men’s college basketball games per week, (b) 10 NCAA football bowl games, including the semifinals and finals and (c) 20 NCAA men’s basketball tournament games, including the semi-finals and the finals and (iii) in March 2022 by acquiring the rights to stream live and on demand up to four Major League Baseball games weekly, in addition to all playoff games, for the next three seasons.

• | Distributing content. Some of the content that we acquire the rights to broadcast in a specific territory may be coupled with the right to further distribute such content outside of that territory. For example, our right to broadcast the next three seasons of Serie B soccer games in Italy, includes the right to distribute and commercialize those rights outside of Italy. We intend to generate revenue from such distribution. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advertising. Helbiz Media will coordinate the sale of advertising for our micro-mobility business as well as Helbiz Live. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are exploring options to sell, reduce or discontinue all or portions of our streaming operations.
Helbiz Kitchen
 Helbiz Kitchen, is a delivery-only “ghost kitchen” restaurant concept that specializes in preparing healthy-inspired, high-quality, fresh, made-to-order meals. Users are able to order meals on our mobile App for delivery to their home, office or other desired location, and we will prepare and deliver such meals using our e-vehicles. We capture all of the revenue from the meal order and the delivery as there will be no middle person.
 We launched Helbiz Kitchen in June 2021 with a pilot ghost kitchen in Milan, Italy. Our approximately 21,500 square foot facility in Milan offers six menus of dishes (pizza, hamburgers, poke, salads, sushi and ice cream) for 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and we intend to expand the variety of the menus and the hours of operation in the near future. We recently opened our first ghost kitchen in the United States.
 Platform User Support
 
The cornerstone of our company and experience is our top-rated customer experience. We have invested and trained our own micro-mobility support center. Our support hub was established in Serbia and is today offering in-app, written, and spoken 24/7 support natively in six languages for customers and drivers around the globe.

Competition
 We provide transportation services, particularly those in the urban micro-mobility category (generally, intra-city trips that less than five miles). As a result, we compete with other modes and providers of transport. For our e-scooter, e-bike and e-moped sharing services, this includes busses, subways, bicycles, cars, trains, motorcycles, scooters and walking, among other short-distance transportation modes.
 Our services compete directly with many TaaS companies. The market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting rider needs and frequent introductions of new service and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors, who may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages, as well as new entrants into the market, some of which may become significant competitors in the future. Our main competitors in the micro-mobility sharing market vary by market but include Lime, Lyft, Bird, Spin and Wind. We also compete with car sharing services such as Uber and Lyft, certain non-ridesharing TaaS network companies, public transportation, taxicab, and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers, such as BMW, which have entered the TaaS market, among others.
 We believe the essential competitive factors in our market include the following:
 •        coverage and availability of access;
 •        scale of network;
 •        product design;
 •        ease of adoption and use;
 •        partnerships and integrations;
 •        branding;
 •        safety;
 •        innovation;
 •        regulatory relations; and
 •        prices.
 Many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and significantly greater resources for the development of their offerings. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see our Risk Factors.
 Strategy
 We are one of the few established micro-mobility operators with a truly scalable infrastructure, deep engagement in our cities and a clear path to capture the opportunity of the fast-growing micro-mobility industry. We plan to leverage our strengths to outperform our competition with the following growth strategies:

• | Grow our Rider base. We see significant opportunity to continue to grow our rider base. We strive to continue drive organic adoption by continued investments in fleet, brand, and consumer awareness. We also offer incentives for first time riders and referrals and plan to continue to grow our incentive programs to foster organic grow. Additionally, we seek to expand our offering beyond e-scooters, e-bikes, Wheels e-bikes and e-mopeds to properly serve all demographics in cities and increase the reach of our platform. Micro-mobility is an industry in its infancy, and Helbiz introduced this technology in Italy, which involved significant user education to shift engraved user behavior. As other slower adapting demographics gradually adopt micro-mobility and the growing percentage of the population who are born as digital natives become of age or increase their spending power, we believe we will benefit from a significant growth not only in rider base but lifetime value across verticals as well.

• | Increase penetration in our existing markets. Although in Italy we are currently a market leader based on vehicles authorized and licenses obtained, we see room for further growth and plan to deploy new e-scooters, e-bikes and e-mopeds into both existing and new service areas in order to meet rising demand. Furthermore, we believe that there is significant opportunity for growth in the United States, as more cities are embracing shared shared-mobility services and municipalities with existing pilot programs and licensed services are ready for license renewals. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue expanding into new markets with optimal regulatory conditions and transportation infrastructure. As authorities around the world begin to adopt acceptable rules and regulations surrounding dock-less e-scooter, e-bike and e-moped sharing, we plan to take advantage of our tech-driven platform, operational excellence and services to offer these cities a sustainable solution. Some of the largest cities and markets in the world have not established regulations to pave the way for these new forms of transit. We will continue to work closely with local regulators globally to unlock these markets and establish a long-term and sustainable relationship. We plan on targeting cities with established infrastructure. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase our use cases. We intend to continue to expand our offerings and products to make Helbiz the transportation platform of choice for all demographics and use cases. We aim to offer product to simplify travel decision making, become a fully integrated A-to-B solution within existing transit network while expanding our subscription packages and B2B offerings among other things through centralized enterprise tools and bulk packages for universities and businesses, to offer, manage and cover transportation needs and of employees and students. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand multimodal offerings. We continue our mission to make Helbiz the number one transportation ecosystem, and we believe that it is essential to address a wide range of transportation needs and preferences for an inclusive offering across demographics. We recently launched e-bikes and e-mopeds in addition to our e-scooters to serve a different demographic and are working on seamlessly integrating public transit to enable riders to optimize their trips across all available offerings based on their preferences. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our platform to launch new products. We believe that we can continue to innovate, solve complex challenges and create platforms on top of our robust and scalable technological infrastructure to meet the localized needs of the mass market consumer, who is already using Helbiz daily, with new services from payments solutions, public transportation and food delivery. Being a high adoption consumer platform with deep penetration in core markets, we believe that we have a unique opportunity to extend our ecosystem and platform offering around the needs of our consumers leveraging our low customer acquisition costs to fuel long-term value and impact. Each platform offering increases the value of our overall platform, enables us to attract new platform users, deepens the individual engagement and retention within the platform while significantly boosting lifetime value across platform and platform loyalty. Our mission is to combine all offerings in a seamless platform meeting all localized needs of the mass market consumer on demand, beyond micro-mobility. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow rider ecosystem spend. As we continue to grow our brand loyalty and offerings, products, use cases and customer experience, the stickiness of our customers increase, integrating Helbiz more into their daily lives and routines. We believe that this will grow their total ecosystem spend significantly over time. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue strategic partnerships. Our early success, despite much less funding than U.S. competitors, was among other things due to our hyper-local approach where we as a young company tailored our approach to the individual city while partnering with well-established companies with loyal customer bases, influence, and synergy to allow us to quickly harness brand awareness, capitalize on their existing reputation for rapid adoption. We intend to continue to pursue strategic synergetic partnerships to strengthen our brand, offering and market adoption. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Continued research and development to increase vehicle-level economics and user experience. Our team is constantly developing new ideas for all facets of our business. From continued development on our mobile application to hardware development for our e-scooters, e-bikes and e-mopeds, we are actively pursuing ways to serve our customers and create a sustainable and profitable business. We have drastically increased lifespan of our entire fleet and the daily availability through 3 generations of vehicles and moving from built-in batteries to swappable batteries eliminating the need to pick up and charge the entire fleet every night allowing vehicles to remain on the street and operational. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Target non-traditional markets. We believe that in the rush to compete in the micro-mobility market, many of our competitors have overlooked markets that might not be considered traditional consumers of micro-mobility services. These markets include hotels, amusement parks, convention halls, airports and other third parties that see a need to provide their customers with additional methods of short-distance transportation. We are exploring these markets and negotiating terms outside our conventional rental arrangements. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our Helbiz Kitchen offering. In July 2021, we launched Helbiz Kitchen, a delivery-only “ghost kitchen” restaurant concept that specializes in preparing healthy-inspired, high-quality, fresh, made-to-order meals, with the opening of our pilot ghost kitchen in Milan, Italy which we intend to follow with other ghost kitchens in the near future. We have opened our first ghost kitchen in the United States in February 2023 and intend to open the second in the coming weeks.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invest in technology to strengthen platform and increase efficiency. We plan to continue to invest in and develop our proprietary technologies and core platform drivers to optimize our operations, autonomy and scalability. These investments will allow us to continue to increase our efficiencies and lower our operational costs offering our riders an affordable and high-quality experience. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow Advertisement Opportunities. We are continuing to grow our advertisement offering and integrations. As we rolled out in-app advertisement in 2020. We expect to be able to significantly grow our overall advertisement revenues as we roll out advertisement in all cities and combine it with additional and more complex advertisement types and dedicated advertisement management tools for enterprises. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seasonality
 Each city and region where we operate or intend to operate has unique seasonality, events and weather that can increase or decrease rider demand for our platform. We expect to experience different levels of seasonality in each market in which we operate, typically correlated to changes in the number of local residents and visitors. Ride volume can also be impacted by general trends in business or travel and tourism. Certain holidays can have an impact on ride volume on the holiday itself or during the preceding and subsequent weekends. In addition, rain, snow and cold weather tend to increase the demand for car-based transportation but reduce the demand for e-scooter, e-bike and e-moped rentals.
Intellectual Property
 We generally rely on trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We are currently in the process of pursuing trademark protection for our name and logos in the United States. Although we believe that our pending trademark applications will be granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, such trademarks might not be granted, might be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or might not provide competitive advantages to us.

We also plan to rely on patents to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, to the extent feasible, and plan to consult with intellectual property counsel to determine what patents we may be able to file to protect our intellectual property. Wheels has already made strides in this area with a number of key innovations, such as our micro-controller technology that allows users to control all vehicle functions via Bluetooth, WiFi, and cellular networks. One of the unique features we have filed a patent for is a pedal-less bike body specifically designed for micro-mobility sharing use, which sets us apart from competitors and offers users a distinctive mode of transportation. Another important innovation is the electrical integration of helmets into the chassis of our Wheels devices, promoting safety, as the helmet can be unlocked and locked when the device is in use or not. To promote hygiene in our shared-use service, we have developed an anti-microbial film inside the helmets, enabling users to replace the film rather than reusing the previous customer's film. Furthermore, we hold patents on the use of gear motors to improve climb performance for hill climbs, providing a better experience for users in hilly terrain. As of the date of this annual report, we have filed a patent application in the United States for our smart parking technology (patent application number: 16/673,518). Although we believe that some of our technology may be patentable, such patents might not be granted, might be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or the rights granted thereunder or under licensing agreements might not provide competitive advantages to us. We believe that due to the rapid pace of technological innovation for technology, mobile, and internet products, our ability to establish and maintain a position of technological leadership in the ridesharing industry depends more on the skills of our development personnel than the legal protection afforded our existing technology.
 Our success depends in part, upon our proprietary software technology and proprietary App. We have not yet protected our software through copyright or other regulatory measures. Our standard intellectual property confidentiality and assignment agreement with employees, consultants and others who participate in the development of our software might be breached, we might not have adequate remedies for any breach, or our trade secrets might not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors. Our efforts to protect our proprietary technology might not prevent others from developing and designing products or technology similar to or competitive with those of ours. Our success depends in part, on our continued ability to license and use third-party technology that is integral to the functionality of our products and App. This includes functions such as our payment gateway that we use for handling credit card payments, subscriptions and wallet top-ups (which we license through Stripe), interfacing with vehicles from certain suppliers (such as our license with Segway), hosting our server infrastructure (provided by Amazon Web Services) and hosting our data for analytics (provided by Google Cloud). An inability to continue to procure or use such technology likely would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.
 Our intellectual property is secured to a syndicated loan and security agreement entered into in 2021.
 We do not intend to create or own any of the media content to be streamed on our Helbiz Live platform. Instead, we plan to license such content. We have acquired a three-year license to broadcast in Italy all 390 regular season games in the Italian Serie B soccer league. We will not own any of the intellectual property associated with such games, the league or the teams in the league.
 Authorizations and licenses in force
 We work closely with the cities where we operate to determine the local services we provide. This includes determining fleet size, deployment locations, hours of operation and pricing. After local operations begin, we revise these determinations using real-time data. We consider compliance with requirements around parking, deployment and redistribution, and rider education to be of the utmost importance. We operate in the following cities in the following countries.

As of March 24, 2023, we hold 6 licenses, in 5 U.S. cities, additionally we operate with small fleet of Wheels vehicles in three University’s campuses. We are currently in the application process for additional licenses and intend to continue to scale and implement our proven business model and platform from Europe across the United States. We currently provide e-scooter and e-bike micro-mobility programs in the following areas the United States:

Insurance
 Although we pride ourselves on our commitment to safety, the sheer volume of users increases the likelihood or serious injury or property damage as a result of the use of our vehicles. To mitigate our exposure to liability from any such injuries or damage, we provide general liability insurance in the cities where we operate to cover third-party bodily injury or property damage resulting from one of our vehicles. The insurance does not cover instances where the user is at fault, but rather damages arising from faulty vehicles or maintenance issues. Additionally, such general liability insurance is required in the U.S. and Italian cities in which we operate and seek to operate.
 Insurance in the micro-mobility industry is unique as it is a limited marketplace. There are only a handful of carriers that will write insurance for it and even less for multi city operators. We have our insurance policies with Apollo Underwriting Ltd. covering the U.S. market and Societa’ Reale Mutua Assicurazione for the Italian market. These policies give us the ability to purchase coverage if and when we get permits for additional cities.
 Partnerships
 We believe that partnerships are a great way to offer our users services that we cannot provide on our own, provide our brand to greater exposure and expand our user base. We have focused our efforts to create partnerships in three industries in particular: the micro-mobility industry, the fintech industry and the entertainment industry.
Mobility Partnerships
 Telepass
 Our first major partnership was with Telepass, a leader in Southern European mobility services. By becoming our official partner and sponsor, Telepass provided us with more concrete and credible brand awareness in Italy. The partnership consists of a deep integration between our app and the Telepass Pay app where existing members of Telepass services are awarded exclusive deals to use our e-scooters. To emphasize our commitment to the partnership, we co-branded our Italian e-scooter and e-bike fleets with both the Helbiz and Telepass brand logos.
 Pursuant to the agreement, Telepass will pay us a total of €50,000 for marketing opportunities provided by us and an additional €250,000 for the concession fee payable by us to the customer. In exchange, we will offer 50% discount to Telepass users on e-scooters and e-bikes.
 Our partnership with Telepass is set to expire in December 2023. Telepass may terminate the agreement if there is material breach and we fail to cure such breach within 15 days from the date of a written notice from Telepass. Telepass also has the right to fully or partially withdraw from the agreement at any time.
 Trenitalia
 We have partnered with Italy’s National Public Railway transportation provider, Trenitalia, to expand their riders’ options of getting to and from train stations. Trenitalia provides us with dedicated parking areas outside of the major train stations in the Italian cities in which we currently operate. We provide promotions and discounts to Trenitalia users to use our vehicles before and/or after their journeys. Trenitalia has engaged in a vast marketing plan to advertise our services inside their train stations, inside train screens and magazines, inside dedicated tabs in their mobile app, and on their website. Reciprocally, we have committed to co-branding our Italian fleet with Trenitalia-dedicated graphics.

--

Pursuant to the agreement, we will provide Trenitalia users vouchers for free rides and discounts and such promotion will be advertised on Trenitalia’s website, in certain trains and train station lounges and through jointly planned educational events around Italy. Our agreement with Trenitalia expires in May 2023. Either party can terminate the agreement with 60 days’ prior written notice.
 WeTaxi
 We have partnered with WeTaxi, a leading taxi operator in Italy, to enable Helbiz users to book taxis directly from our app.  Riders using the Helbiz app will see a maximum price when booking a taxi, which allows for easy planning.  Furthermore, users can use multiple payment methods and book shared routes with friends.  The partnership enables WeTaxi cab drivers and cab cooperatives to reach a younger target audience that does not normally use their service.  WeTaxi states that is has about 6,000 drivers operating in 20 cities in Italy.
 Helbiz & Wheels Google Maps
 In late 2022 we completed the integration of Wheels vehicles onto the Google Maps platform, whereby our unique sit-down scooters appear on the map with the approximate price, estimated trip duration and optimized route to the traveler’s desired destination.  This collaboration expands on the previously-announced integration of Helbiz vehicles into Google Maps, expanding access to our efficient and sustainable transportation options.  By using Google Maps, Helbiz users worldwide can find a nearby vehicle to quickly meet their first and last-mile needs, while also reducing traffic and pollution.
Yolo Insurance
 Helbiz partnered with YOLO, Italy's first mover in insurtech, to launch Helbiz Insurance, a new suite of digital insurance solutions available directly from the Helbiz app.  The insurance offerings available to Helbiz customers includes specific solutions to protect cyclists and their bicycles from risks, accidents, breakdowns, and any other unforeseen events that may occur during a trip. These innovative instant insurance solutions, created in collaboration with a leading insurance provider, are distinguished by the simplicity, customization options and speed of the purchasing process. Meant to be purchased on the go via the in-app wallet, riders will have temporary coverage for as little as one to a maximum of 30 days.  YOLO Group, listed on the professional segment of Euronext Growth Milan, is one of the leading players in the Italian market for digital insurance services that allow underwriting on an on-demand and pay-per-use basis for products of major national and international insurance groups.
 FinTech Partnership
 E-Pay
 November 2020, Helbiz signs an agreement with EPAY, part of the Euronet Group, to allow its user base to purchase In-App Wallet Credit in cash through a network of 51,650 physical stores in Italy, allowing potential users without a debit/credit card the ability to make use of our sustainable services. This network of physical points of sale, composed of Supermarkets (ex. Carrefour, Esselunga, Finiper, Penny Market), Libraries (ex. Feltrinelli, Mondadori), Tobacco stores, Electronic Stores and direct distributors, extends itself across the entire country easing access to the Helbiz micro-mobility services and to future parallels on which the company is currently working on.
 The agreement is an open-ended agreement without terms between the Company and E-Pay. Helbiz will request a renegotiation of the agreement in June 2023 after three years of collaboration. Either party can terminate the agreement with a 30 days’ prior written notice to the other party. Pursuant to the agreement, Helbiz will pay E-Pay a fixed Fee of €12,000 for the service, a maintenance fee of €1,000 on a monthly basis, and a distribution fee which is calculated as 10% of any transaction’s face value.

Suppliers
 We subcontract the manufacturing, assembly and testing of our vehicles to third-party suppliers mainly located in Asia. Our supply chain department is responsible for coordinating the relationship with the third-party suppliers and is constantly working with current manufactures in a collaborative effort to improve and optimize existing hardware, design, and build custom proprietary vehicles for custom needs while also looking for alternative manufacturers, solutions, and supply routes to ensure that we stay on the forefront of the rapid technological advancements in our industry.
 The typical supply chain timeline requires on average three-months from manufacturing the e-vehicles, delivery to deploying in the relevant markets. The process depends on the typical supply lines running via sea, train and air. A mix of local suppliers and suppliers based in Asia, are responsible for providing us spare parts for our e-vehicles.
 Overall, we depend upon a limited number of third parties to perform these functions, some of which are only available from single sources with which we have flexible contracts in place. In particular, we rely on:
 •        Stripe for the processing of customer payments;
 •        Segway Group for the supply of our electric fleet, excluding Wheels; and
 •        I-Walk for the supply of Wheels electric fleet.
 Stripe
 Pursuant to the agreement, the debit and credit cards service fees are calculated based on preceding month’s total card transaction volume. The service fees range from €0.01 to €0.02 per card payment. For example, if the net monthly card volume is €0 to €250,000, the fixed amount per payment card is €0.02; if the net monthly card volume is €500,000 to €1,250,000, the fixed amount per payment card is €0.015. The higher the monthly card volume, the lower the service fee.
 Our agreement with Stripe expires in September 2023.
 Segway
 Pursuant to our agreements with Segway, we purchased approximately 7,000 e-scooters, in 2020. Segway charges a monthly fee for its licensed technology. An e-scooter is considered an active product for any month that is active at any time during that month. Segway also charges hourly technical support fees. In addition, Segway imposes minimum service fees. Our agreement with Segway will expire in May 2023 and is automatically renewable for another one year each, unless either party provides at least 60 days’ prior written notice stating the intent not to renew prior to the end of such term. Either party may terminate the agreement if the other party breaches any material terms of the agreement and does not cure the breach within 30 days after receiving written notice from the non-breaching party. Additionally, Segway may terminate the agreement if we breach our obligation to make payments, to comply with the restriction on use and resale of Segway’s products, the laws and other programs applicable to the use of Segway’s products, the license of Segway’s technology and software, privacy and data securities, and confidentiality and fails to cure such breach within 10 days after notice of breach from Segway. Segway may also terminate the agreement with 30 days’ prior written notice if Segway reasonably believes our operations create undue risks for Segway, the end users or other third parties or if Segway reasonably believes that any new laws or amendments to existing law makes the performance of the agreement unlawful or impracticable. Lastly, Segway may terminate the agreement immediately if we file for bankruptcy.

 Material Agreements
 In addition to our compensation agreements with management and other material agreements described elsewhere in this annual report, we have entered into the following material agreements under which we still have obligations or rights:
Loan and Security Agreement
 On March 23, 2021, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan and Security Agreement”) and other related agreements with four institutional lenders. Under the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement, the aggregate principal amount of the loan was $15 million dollars and we received net proceeds of $11.9 million thereunder. We are required to pay back such loan and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon on December 1, 2023.
 The loan carries interest at 9.2% per annum, which increases in the event of a default under the loan to 13.2%. The interest of the loan is due monthly, but no payments need be made directly by Helbiz during the first year as twelve months of interest payments were held in reserve and the first interest payments are paid from that reserve until it is reduced to zero. At closing, Helbiz was required to pay in advance an intellectual property insurance premium of 3.5% per annum (or part thereof).
 In connection with the loan, Helbiz granted the lenders a security interest in certain intellectual property held by Helbiz, Inc. In the event of a default, the lenders may acquire that intellectual property to settle any amounts due under the loan.
 Acquisition of Wheels Labs, Inc. 
 On November 18, 2022, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Wheels Labs, Inc. (“Wheels”), and Wheels became our wholly-owned subsidiary when another wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”) merged with and into Wheels (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, we entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Amended Merger Agreement”) on October 24, 2022 with Wheels and Merger Sub and an Escrow Agreement with Wheels, Merger Sub, an escrow agent and an authorized representative of certain security holders of Wheels.
 
Pursuant to the Amended Merger Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding share capital of Wheels, Merger Sub merged with and into Wheels and became our wholly-owned subsidiary. The following is a summary of the Amended Merger Agreement, and we suggest that you review the entire Agreement, which is attached as an exhibit to this Current Report, if you would like to have a deeper understanding of its terms.
 
Consideration
 
In exchange for all of the outstanding share capital of Wheels, we issued to security holders of Wheels approximately 6,751,823 Series A convertible preferred stock equal to six and ninety-nine hundredths (6.99%) of our total issued and outstanding common stock immediately prior to the Closing (as may be adjusted downwards pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Amended Merger Agreement). The Series A convertible preferred stock converted into 5,343,184 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock upon the approval of the majority of the holders of the Company’s common stock to allow for such issuance under Nasdaq Rule 5635 (the “Stockholder Approval”).

 Serie B Licenses
 On June 7, 2021, we entered into two agreements with Lega Nazionale Professionisti Serie B (“League Serie B”) to acquire the rights to broadcast approximately 390 regular season soccer games in Serie B for the next three seasons, on a non-exclusive basis. Additionally, Helbiz Media has been appointed by the League Serie B as the exclusive distributor of the Serie B international media rights. Pursuant to the agreements with the League Serie B, Helbiz Media will commercialize such international rights on behalf of the League Serie B. Under these agreements, Serie B will take care of the TV productions of all matches and will provide the feeds to Helbiz Media. The agreements that we entered into with League Serie B for rights outside of Italy gives us the right to distribute the rights to third parties to broadcast the Serie B games outside of Italy, including Helbiz Media itself. We have guaranteed Serie B a minimum annual payment of €2.5 million (approximately $3 million) in connection with the distribution of the rights outside of Italy, and any amounts received after €2.5 million (approximately $3 million) will be divided among us and League Serie B.
 The agreements that we entered into with Serie B for rights in Italy are non-exclusive rights. The rights to broadcast in Italy have been sold to two other over-the-top providers pursuant to agreements on the same terms as well as to one provider for terrestrial and/or cable and satellite broadcast.

 Convertible Debenture Securities Purchase Agreement
On October 12, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an investor pursuant to which the investor agreed to purchase from us an aggregate of $30,000,000 worth of convertible notes.
 
We sold $15,000,000 worth of convertible notes on October 12, 2021, an additional $10,000,000 on or around October 27, 2021, and an additional $5,000,000 on or around November 10, 2021.

The floor price for the convertible notes range from $8.25 to $4.78.
 
Each of the convertible notes matures on one the one-year anniversary of its issuance date. The rate of interest on the convertible notes will be 5% per annum, which shall increase to 15% at any time that there is an uncured event of default.
 
If, after 90 days from issuance date of a convertible note, the daily VWAP of our common stock is less than the floor price for 10 trading days in a 15 consecutive trading-day period, that convertible note will become payable in equal monthly installments until the earlier of the date that (i) the 10 consecutive trading day VWAP exceeds the floor price or (ii) the floor price for the conversion price is reset to an amount that is equal to 85% of the closing bid price on the trading day prior to such reset, provided that such reset floor price is not greater than $10.00. Monthly payments will include principal, interest and a redemption premium equal to 20% of the principal amount being redeemed (the “Amortization Payments”). Amortization Payments will be reduced by any conversion since the payment of our prior Amortization Payment. On January 10, 2022, we reset the floor price on the $15,000,000 debenture from $10.00 to $4.78, and on February 2, 2022, we reset the floor price on our $10,000,000 debenture from $8.25 to $2.50.
