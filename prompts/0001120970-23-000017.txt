ITEM 1        BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
Comstock innovates technologies that efficiently use wasted and under-utilized natural resources to produce renewable energy and other products that contribute to balancing global uses and emissions of carbon and enhance mineral and material discoveries. We plan on achieving significant financial, natural and social returns by using our and other's technologies to develop production-ready projects that we will license to qualified clients, and to sell an array of complimentary process solutions and related services. 
Our Cellulosic Fuels technologies include proprietary processes that have the potential to convert vast quantities of historically wasted and unused but widely available and rapidly replenishable woody biomass supplies into advanced renewable fuels capable of sustainably offsetting billions of metric tons of fossil fuel emissions worldwide. 
Our Electrification Metals technologies include a two-stage lithium-ion battery (“LIB”) recycling process designed to crush, separate, and condition LIBs for the production of high purity black mass minerals available for extracting battery grade metals. 
We own and operate pilot facilities for our Cellulosic Fuels and Electrification Metals technologies that we use in our ongoing technology development and commercialization efforts. We also hold a worldwide license to advanced new Mining technologies that will use machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, hyperspectral orbital imaging, and ultimately, quantum-enabled sensors to provide high precision prospecting information in mineral discovery and mining applications. 
We have also consolidated and now own or control the most significant portions of the historic Comstock gold and silver mining district, consisting of 9,472 acres of patented mining claims, unpatented mining claims and surface parcels (due to overlapping interest, the combined area is approximately 7,586 acres) located in Storey and Lyon Counties, Nevada, which we will use as the proving grounds for these mineral discoveries and mining technologies. 
We recently completed a third-party S-K 1300 technical report focused on a small subset of our mineral estate that we refer to as the Dayton-Spring Valley exploration target. That report estimated that the Dayton-Spring Valley area contains measured and indicated mineral resources containing 293,000 ounces of gold and 2,120,000 ounces of silver resources. The Dayton-Spring Valley exploration target also contains an additional inferred mineral resource containing 90,000 ounces of inferred gold resources and 480,000 ounces of inferred silver resources.
Properties in the Lucerne resource area and the Occidental and Gold Hill exploration targets were previously optioned or leased to Tonogold Resources, Inc. ("Tonogold"), who completed and published a third-party, S-K 1300 technical report for the Lucerne, Occidental and Gold Hill targets in March 2022. That report estimated that the Lucerne area contains an indicated mineral resource containing 312,000 ounces of gold and 3,760,000 ounces of silver. Lucerne also contains an additional inferred mineral resource containing 207,000 ounces of gold and 2,092,000 ounces of silver. All Tonogold agreements either expired or were terminated on December 30, 2022. Accordingly, Tonogold no longer has any interest, rights or claims in any of the Company's properties.
OPERATING SEGMENTS
We group our business activities into three operating segments to manage performance:
Renewable Energy Segment
Our renewable energy segment will develop technology for the deploying of extraction and refining facilities that convert wasted and unused biomass and other natural resources into valuable renewable energy, including intermediates and precursors for advanced renewable fuels, such as carbon neutral oil, ethanol, gasoline, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation ("jet") fuel and marine fuel and electrification products. We are currently evaluating several alternatives, for licensing to partners, for the construction of facilities based on our Cellulosic Fuels technologies. We are also currently developing an existing demonstration system to extract highly-pure black mass containing lithium, graphite, nickel, cobalt, manganese, copper, aluminum and other metals from up to lithium-ion batteries ("LIB"). Our renewable energy segment will initially license selected technologies to strategic partners and customers, and offer an array of complimentary upstream and downstream design, engineering, fabrication, procurement, and construction solutions based on our experience and core competencies in technology development, process engineering, and project deployment, with a focus on processes that support long-term feedstock and offtake clients.
Mining Segment
Our mining segment has consolidated the most significant portions of the historic Comstock mining district, amassed the single largest known repository of historical and current geological data on the Comstock region, secured permits, built an infrastructure and completed two phases of test production. Comstock and its mining subsidiaries own, control, or retain interest in twelve square miles of primarily mineralized properties, or 9,472 acres (and due to overlapping interests, the combined area is approximately 7,586 acres) located in Storey and Lyon Counties, Nevada, just south of Virginia City, Nevada (referred to collectively herein as the “Comstock Lode District”). Because of the Comstock Lode District’s historical significance, the geology is well known and has been extensively studied. The volume of geologic data is significant, particularly in the Lucerne and Dayton resource areas. We have completed extensive geological mapping, sampling and drilling on a limited portion of the Comstock Lode District’s property, particularly the Lucerne and Dayton resource areas, in order to characterize the mineralized material. 
We have performed metallurgical testing, mine planning and economic analysis, and have produced an SEC Regulation S-K Subpart 1300 (“S-K 1300”) compliant report for the Dayton resource area. We conducted extensive test mining operations from 2004 through 2006 and 2012 through 2016. Most of the remaining portion of the Comstock Mineral Estate is comprised of exploration stage properties that we intend to develop with our mining technologies.
Strategic and Other Investments Segment
We own and manage several investments and projects that are strategic to our plans and ability to produce and maximize throughput in our renewable energy and mining segments, but that are not a component of either such other segments or otherwise have distinct operating activities for management purposes. Our strategic and other investments segment includes our recent investments in quantum-computing based materials engineering and other decarbonizing technologies as well as our non-mining property development assets and related investments. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Comstock historically focused on natural resource exploration, development, and production, with an emphasis on exploring, developing and mining gold and silver resources from its extensive contiguous property holdings in the historic Comstock Lode and Silver City mining districts in Nevada (collectively, our “Comstock Mineral Estate”). Between 2012 and 2016, we mined and processed about 2.6 million tons of mineralized material from the Comstock Mineral Estate, producing 59,515 ounces of gold and 735,252 ounces of silver. We subsequently focused on diversification and during 2021 and 2022, we completed a series of transactions that were designed to build on our competencies and position us and our technologies to enhance our exploration and mineral discovery capabilities and to address and capitalize on the global transition to clean energy. Those transactions primarily included our acquisitions of 100% of Comstock Innovations Corporation, 100% of Comstock Engineering Corporation, 88.21% of LINICO Corporation, our acquisition of 48.19% of Quantum Generative Materials LLC, and our acquisition of the intellectual property portfolio from FLUX Photon Corporation. Collectively, these transactions added the management, employees, facilities, intellectual properties, and other assets we needed to restructure and transform our company and business into an emerging leader in both the innovation and licensing of the technology that enables sustainable production of renewable energy, including cellulosic fuels and electrification metals technology and data enhanced mineral exploration and mining. Additional information on these transactions is provided in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
Our management team has deep experience in a diverse array of industries, including renewable fuels, mining, hazardous waste, graphite, manufacturing, agriproducts, and intellectual property research, development, and commercialization. We have core competencies in systemic management and innovating and scaling new technologies to commercial maturity, with significant expertise and know-how in the design, engineering, construction, integration, operation, and scaling of facilities based on our patented, patent-pending, and proprietary processes and other technologies. Our expertise, know-how, technologies, and patent position collectively comprise our primary competitive strengths, and form the basis for our growth plans and the value-added renewable energy, mineral discovery, process solutions, related services, and client licensing options.
Our team has designed, engineered, built, commissioned, and operated many industrial processing facilities in multiple industries, including 26 advanced renewable fuel production facilities for third-party clients. Most notably, our team invented and commercialized technologies that integrate into the backend of corn ethanol plants to extract and recover what was an historically-overlooked natural resource – inedible crude corn oil, for use in the production of advanced carbon-neutral liquid fuels and other biomass-derived alternatives to fossil fuel products. Upwards of 95% of the U.S. corn ethanol industry uses that technology today to offset more than 20 million barrels of fossil fuels per year, with an estimated total lifetime contribution in excess of 250 million barrels of avoided fossil fuel. Those results are validating proof of a repeatable and scalable concept on which we plan to capitalize with our patented, patent-pending and proprietary technologies. Our strategic and tactical plans rely on the commercialization of technologies for renewable energy that shift and leverage the consumption patterns of industries and populations to enable systemic decarbonization and contribute to a net zero carbon world.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Electrification and continued advancements in energy storage are vitally necessary to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. However, more than 61% of the electricity needed to power that infrastructure is currently generated by the combustion of fossil fuels, notwithstanding the impact of increased global urgency, continued innovation, and the accelerating growth of renewable energy. 
Simultaneously, about 14% of the estimated 70 million new vehicles sold worldwide in 2022 were electric. While electric vehicle (“EV”) sales are anticipated to account for between 30% and 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030, there will only be about 145 million EVs on the road in 2030 under those aggressive growth scenarios. In contrast, there were more than 1.45 billion passenger cars and commercial vehicles in use worldwide at the end of 2022, and more than 98% of them were powered by gasoline or diesel fuel. Those vehicles accounted for more than 60% of the 7.7 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted by the transportation sector in 2022, and that amount is expected to increase by more than 50% as the combustion fleet continues to grow beyond 2030. The growth and turnover of that fleet will have a significant impact on the world’s harmful carbon emissions. 
Accordingly, we believe that combustion will continue to be the dominant source of power for transportation and energy for decades to come, if for no other reason than the fact that the associated infrastructure is already deployed on a planetary scale. We also believe that the world’s entrenched combustion apparatus can play an extremely important role in enabling systemic decarbonization and achieving global net zero. Using it will require focus to shift to burning in balance – to sustainably cycling carbon by burning less fossil fuel, by burning more renewable fuel, and by growing and monetizing more biomass to recycle emissions and maximize the production of renewable fuels. 
The Earth’s natural carbon cycle provides a highly-scalable pathway for global decarbonization. The key to using it is to strike and sustain a profitable new balance between its living systems and humanity’s global uses, wastes, and emissions of carbon. We plan on doing so by focusing on and working exclusively with the abundance of short cycle carbon that’s already on and above the surface of the Earth, and by leaving as much long cycle fossil carbon as possible in subsurface reserves. Humanity’s combustion practices can become a part of the natural carbon cycle by providing sufficient quantities of carbon dioxide to grow more terrestrial biomass, which would increase and ultimately iterate to a healthy balance with the available emissions.
In a simple example of the associated impact, sustainably harvesting 3.4 billion metric tons per year of biomass would be enough to absorb 4.0 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year and produce 1.5 billion metric tons per year of renewable fuels with our Cellulosic Fuels technologies. That fuel would shift 10% of the global burn to short cycle carbon, thereby reducing the net addition of previously sequestered long cycle carbon into the atmosphere and oceans by 4.0 billion metric tons to 36 billion metric tons per year. Total fuel consumption worldwide would remain at 15 billion metric tons per year, and total emissions would remain at 40 billion metric tons per year, but 10% of the global burn would then be circular. 
The World Resources Institute (“WRI”) estimates that the world’s forests absorb about 16 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, or about 8 billion net of emissions due to deforestation and other disturbances. Reducing and replacing half of those losses would offset 10% of humanity’s annual emissions, however, prior methods for effecting such solutions had limited economic value. Our Cellulosic Fuels solutions dramatically alter that dynamic by unlocking and efficiently converting wasted, unused, and rapidly-replenishable woody biomass and other short cycle renewable resources into intermediates and precursors for the production of carbon neutral crude oil, ethanol, gasoline, renewable diesel, jet fuel, marine fuel, and other renewable replacements for long cycle fossil derivatives. 
Our strategic plan is based on innovating and licensing our technologies and the renewable energy that they enable to reduce reliance on long cycle fossil fuels, to shift to and maximize throughput of short cycle fuels, and to lead and support the adoption and growth of a balanced global short cycle carbon ecosystem, with embedded economic incentives to offset, recycle, and contribute to neutralizing emissions by growing and selling more feedstock and fuel. 
We also make strategic and other investments that contribute to our mission of enabling systemic decarbonization and help to realize our vision of a net zero carbon world. Our current investments include advanced new technologies involving quantum computing based materials engineering to create quantum-enabled generative artificial intelligence and sensing technologies to develop breakthrough new materials for energy storage, electronics, and data enhanced mineral exploration and mining.
COMPETITION
We compete with other renewable fuel technologies, electrification metals, clean technology engineering, licensing, and mineral exploration companies in connection with the acquisition of properties and assets, feedstock and offtake agreements, and clients, and the attraction and retention of human capital. Those competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do.
Our cellulosic ethanol technology and customers will compete with ethanol produced by the highly fragmented U.S. corn ethanol industry, including from plants owned by farmers, cooperatives, oil refiners and retail fuel operators that may continue to operate even when market conditions are not favorable due to the benefits realized from their other operations. The size of the biomass-based diesel industry is small compared to the size of the petroleum-based diesel fuel industry. In the United States 
and Canadian biomass-based diesel markets, our technology will compete with independent biomass-based diesel producers, as well as large, multi-product companies that have greater resources than we do. 
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration data, renewable diesel imports from Singapore to the U.S. totaled 252 million gallons in 2019, 280 million gallons in 2020, and 391 million gallons in in 2021. Significant additional import activity from other countries is likely to occur. We also face the prospect that petroleum refiners will be increasingly competitive with our technology, either by converting oil refineries to produce renewable diesel or by co-processing renewable feedstock with crude oil. Since 2021, several petroleum refiners in the U.S. have affected conversions of their facilities from crude oil to renewables including but not limited to Sinclair, Phillips 66, Holly Frontier, Marathon, and Exxon. Some of the largest refiners have started co-processing renewable feedstocks or have announced plans to do so. If refinery conversions accelerate or if co-processing expands significantly, the competition we face could increase significantly. We also face competition in the biomass-based diesel RIN compliance market from producers of renewable diesel and in the advanced biofuel RIN compliance market from producers of other advanced biofuels, such as Brazilian sugarcane ethanol producers and producers of biogas used in transportation.
We also operate in the lithium-ion battery (“LIB”) recycling industry, where we face competition primarily from companies that focus on one type of recycling, some of which have more expertise in the recycling of that material than we do. We also compete against companies that have a substantial competitive advantage because of longer operating histories and greater financial and other resources. National or global competitors could enter the market with more substantial financial and workforce resources, stronger existing customer relationships, and greater name recognition, or could choose to target medium to small companies in our markets. Competitors could also focus their substantial resources on developing more efficient recovery solutions than our highly efficient processes planned for lithium, graphite and other material extraction. Competition also places downward pressure on contract prices and royalties, which presents significant challenges to maintaining growth rates and acceptable margins. 
CUSTOMERS
The Company is not dependent on a limited number of customers for its sales.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE
We are an emerging leader in the global shift to a circular economy. Our systemic management methodology, corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) and environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) policies and framework defines, seeks, and accounts for benefits in ways that align all of our stakeholder interests with sustainability objectives that are designed to rise to the realities of our time; where benefits are defined in terms of three different interdependent forms of capital – financial, natural, and social, that we generate while making a positive impact on the economy, the environment, and our local and global communities. 
REGULATORY MATTERS
Once operational, our renewable energy segment will be sensitive to government programs and policies that affect the supply and demand for ethanol, gasoline, renewable diesel, jet fuel, marine fuel, other renewable fuels, and their intermediates, precursors, and derivatives, which in turn may impact our throughput. 
The demand for cellulosic and carbon neutral fuels is rapidly increasing, and supply is virtually non-existent for the want of recently developed process technologies. Global demand is approaching 10% of the total fuel supply, with stable market prices linked to carbon reduction standards. America’s renewable fuels standard (“RFS II”) is driving innovation by both requiring and incentivizing use of advanced cellulosic fuels, including for upwards of 16 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol annually by 2022. 
Under the RFS II, renewable fuel producers are essentially guaranteed market access inasmuch as fossil fuel producers are required to purchase renewable fuels to meet RFS II quotas. The EPA assigns individual refiners, blenders and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to blend into the fuel supply each year based on their percentage of total fuel sales. The EPA has the authority to waive the mandates in whole or in part if there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply, if the requirement severely harms the environment, or harms the economy of the nation or a state. The RFS II volume requirements apply to petroleum refiners and petroleum fuel importers in the 48 contiguous states and Hawaii, who are defined as obligated parties in the RFS II regulations. Obligated parties are required to incorporate a certain percentage of renewable fuel into their petroleum-based fuel or purchase credits in the form of renewable identification numbers from those who do. An 
obligated party’s RVO is based on the volume of petroleum-based fuel they produce or import. The largest U.S. petroleum refining companies, such as British Petroleum, Chevron, Citgo, ExxonMobil, Marathon, PBE, Phillips 66, and Valero, represent the majority of the total RVO, with the remainder made up of smaller refiners and importers.
The RFS II requirements are based on two primary categories and two subcategories. The two primary categories are conventional renewable fuel, which is primarily satisfied by corn ethanol, and advanced biofuel, which is defined as a biofuel that reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% compared to the petroleum-based fuel the biofuel is replacing. The advanced biofuel category has two subcategories: cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel, which can be satisfied with ethanol made from woody biomass and renewable diesel, respectively. The total advanced biofuel requirement is larger than the combined cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel requirement, thus requiring the use of additional volumes of advanced biofuels. The RFS II requirement for advanced biofuels can be satisfied by any advanced biofuel, including fuels produced with our Cellulosic Fuels technologies, so long as it meets the 50% greenhouse gas reduction requirement which our solutions meet. 
The advanced biofuel RVO is expressed in terms of ethanol equivalent volumes, or EEV, which is based on the fuel’s renewable energy content compared to ethanol. Renewable diesel typically has an EEV of 1.7, compared to 1.0 for ethanol. Accordingly, it requires less biomass-based diesel than ethanol to meet the required volumes as each gallon of biomass-based diesel counts as more gallons for purposes of fulfilling the advanced biofuel RVO, providing an incentive for refiners and importers to purchase biomass-based diesel to meet their advanced biofuel RVO.
Advanced cellulosic and other fuels are able to be sold at higher prices than traditional corn ethanol due to their increased GHG reductions. The EPA ensures compliance with the RFS II by assigning a Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) to each gallon of renewable fuel produced or imported into the U.S. RINs are generated by renewable fuel producers, passed onto fossil fuel producers that purchase renewable fuels, and then submitted to the EPA. Producers assign RINs to their renewable fuels and the RINs are detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel domestically. Market participants can trade the detached RINs in the open market. Fossil fuel producers that do not want to buy and distribute renewable fuel can buy RINs and submit them to the EPA to show compliance with RFS II. Obligated parties must obtain and retire the required number of RINs to satisfy their RVO during a particular compliance period. An obligated party can obtain RINs by buying renewable fuels with RINs attached, buying RINs that have been separated, or producing renewable fuels themselves. All RIN activity under RFS II must be entered into the EPA’s moderated transaction system, which tracks RIN generation, transfer and retirement. RINs are retired when used for compliance with the RFS II requirements. 
The market price of detached RINs affects the price of renewable fuels in certain markets and can influence purchasing decisions by obligated parties. The value of RINs can significantly impact to the price of renewable fuel.
The federal biodiesel mixture excise tax credit (“BTC”), provides an additional $1.00 refundable tax credit per gallon to the first blender of biomass-based diesel with petroleum-based diesel fuel. The BTC can then be credited against federal excise tax liabilities or the blender can obtain a cash refund from the U.S. Treasury for the value of the credit. The BTC was first implemented on January 1, 2005 and has been allowed to lapse multiple times before being retroactively reinstated. The BTC is an incentive shared across the advanced biofuel production and distribution chain through routine, daily trading and negotiation. In December 2019, the BTC was retroactively reinstated for 2018 and 2019,and made effective from January 2020 through December 2022.
Individual state and other governments are also pushing the demand beyond the federal requirements. California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia all have Low Carbon Fuel Standards (“LCFS”) that encourage consumption of advanced biofuels by setting annual carbon intensity (“CI”) emission standards which reduce over time. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 40 states have implemented various programs that encourage the use of biomass-based diesel through blending requirements as well as various tax incentives.
The goal of California’s LCFS, for example, is to reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector by 20% by 2032. The regulation quantifies lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by assigning a CI score to each transportation fuel based on that fuel’s lifecycle assessment. Each petroleum fuel provider (generally the fuel’s producer or importer, or “regulated party”) is required to ensure that the overall CI score for its fuel pool meets the annual CI target for a given year. A regulated party’s fuel pool can include gasoline, diesel, and their blendstocks and substitutes. Any alternative fuel is characterized by its CI, generating credits based on its carbon emissions (or lack thereof). Fuels with the lowest CI score, generate the most credits, and reap the highest market price. Although any fuel can generate credits, California also has an E10 mandate which requires all gasoline be mixed with 10% ethanol, this has led to a consistent demand for over 1 billion gallons of ethanol per year. As the LCFS and CI requirements get increasingly stringent, fuel providers will be unable to meet their required CI reductions with corn ethanol alone. Comstock’s advanced cellulosic ethanol is less carbon intensive than conventional corn ethanol, thereby providing 
opportunities for increased sales. For comparison, the market value of cellulosic ethanol in the California market is equal to the price for conventional ethanol, plus the RIN value, plus the LCFS value based on the CI score. We will obtain carbon credits when we sell qualified fuels into California. 
Likewise, the Oregon Clean Fuel Program requires a 10% reduction of the average carbon intensity of Oregon’s transportation fuels from 2021 levels by 2025. The baseline year for the program is 2021 and represents 10% ethanol blended with gasoline and 5% biodiesel blended with diesel. The Oregon Renewable Fuels Standard requires all gasoline sold in the state to be blended with 10% ethanol (“E10”). In addition, all diesel fuel sold in the state must be blended with at least 5% bio-based diesel. In March of 2020, the Oregon Governor issued an executive order to expand the Clean Fuel Program to achieve at least a 20% reduction from 2021 levels by 2030 and a 25% reduction by 2035. The executive order is currently in a rule making process, with a targeted effective date of January 1, 2023. We will obtain carbon credits when we sell qualified fuels in Oregon. 
In the European Union, or EU, the Renewable Energy Directive established a 10% target by 2021 for the use of renewable energy in the transport sector in EU member states. Given the existing limited market presence of alternative fuels or electromobility, the majority of the target has been realized through biofuels. In 2018, a revised Renewable Energy Directive, RED II, was established. RED II set a target of 14% renewables in transport and a 32% reduction of greenhouse gases, to be progressively achieved from 2022 until 2030. Biofuels produced from certain types of waste feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, benefit from extra incentives and so-called advanced feedstocks even get a specific sub-mandate. Additionally, RED II opens up new outlets such as marine fuels or renewable aviation fuels. In 2022, each of the EU Member States is in the process of ratifying RED II into national legislation. Since the adoption of RED II, the EU has introduced the European Green Deal, a package of new measures that are intended to align the EU's environmental goals with the Paris Accord objectives and, according, the European Commission is exploring whether to update RED II.
A small refinery is defined as one that processes fewer than 75,000 barrels of petroleum per day. Small refineries can petition the EPA for a SRE which, if approved, waives their portion of the annual RVO requirements. The EPA, through consultation with the DOE and the USDA can grant a full or partial waiver, or deny it outright within 90 days of submittal. The EPA granted significantly more of these waivers for the 2017, 2018, and 2021 reporting years than they had in prior years. This totaled 790 mmg of waived requirements for the 2021 compliance year, 1.82 billion gallons for 2017 and 1.43 billion gallons for 2018. In doing so, the EPA effectively reduced the RFS II mandated volumes for those compliance years, and as a result, RIN values declined significantly.
Biofuels groups have filed a lawsuit in the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, challenging the 2019 RVO rule over the EPA’s failure to address small refinery exemptions in the rule making. This was the first RFS II rule making since the expanded use of the exemptions came to light; however, the EPA had declined to cap the number of waivers it grants, and until late 2020, had declined to alter how it accounts for the retroactive waivers in its annual volume calculations. The EPA has a statutory mandate to ensure the volume requirements are met, which are achieved by setting the percentage standards for obligated parties. We believe the EPA’s recent approach accomplished the opposite in that even if all the obligated parties complied with their respective percentage obligations for 2019, the nation’s overall supply of renewable fuel would not meet the total volume requirements set by the EPA. This undermines Congressional intent to increase the consumption of renewable fuels in the domestic transportation fuel supply. Biofuels groups have argued the EPA must therefore adjust its percentage standard calculations to make up for past retroactive waivers and adjust the standards to account for any waivers it reasonably expects to grant in the future. In 2019, in a supplemental rule-making to the 2020 RVO rule, the EPA changed their approach, and for the first time accounted for the gallons that they anticipate will be waived from the blending requirements due to small refinery exemptions. To accomplish this, they added in the trailing three year average of gallons the DOE recommended be waived, in effect raising the blending volumes across the board in anticipation of waiving the obligations in whole or in part for certain refineries that qualify for the exemptions. Though the EPA has often disregarded the recommendations of the DOE in years past, they stated in the rule their intent to adhere to these recommendations going forward, including granting partial waivers. 
In January 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled on RFA et. al. vs. EPA in favor of biofuels interests, overturning EPA’s granting of refinery exemptions to three refineries on two separate grounds. The Court agreed that, under the Clean Air Act, refineries are eligible for SREs for a given RVO year only if such exemptions are extensions of exemptions granted in previous RVO years. In this case, the three refineries at issue did not qualify for SREs in the year prior to the year that EPA granted them. They were thus ineligible for additional SRE relief because there were no immediately prior SREs to extend. In addition, the Court agreed that the disproportionate economic hardship prong of SRE eligibility should be determined solely by reference to whether compliance with the RFS II creates such hardship, not whether compliance plus other issues create disproportionate economic hardship. The Court thus vacated EPA's grant of SREs for certain years and remanded the grants back to EPA. The refiners appealed for a rehearing which was denied. Two of the refiners appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court and in January 2021, the Supreme Court announced they would hear the case. If the decision against the 
EPA is upheld by the Supreme Court, it is uncertain how the EPA will propose to remedy the situation. In light of the 10th Circuit ruling, a number of refineries have applied for “gap year” SREs in an effort to establish a continuous string of relief and to ensure they are able to qualify for SREs going forward. A total of 64 gap year requests were filed with the EPA and reviewed by the DOE. In September 2020 the EPA announced that they were denying 54 of the gap year requests that had been scored and returned by DOE, regardless of how they had been scored. Without a string of continuous SRE approvals, almost no small refinery would be eligible to apply for hardship relief in this manner, unless the Supreme Court overturns the 10th Circuit ruling, which we believe is unlikely.
Our renewable energy segment activities are subject to various and extensive environmental and other regulations. We will be required to obtain and maintain various environmental permits to operate our plants and other facilities. Renewable fuel production involves the emission of various airborne pollutants, including particulate, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, hazardous air pollutants and volatile organic compounds. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions, which the EPA later addressed in RFS II. 
There has been an increase in battery regulation globally in recent years. For example, California is evaluating a policy to drive Recycling Efficiency Rates as close to 100% as possible, potentially beginning as early as 2022. In Canada, Ontario is requiring Recycling Efficiency Rates for lithium ion batteries (“LIBs”) of over 70% by 2023. China has required functional material recovery rates greater than 80% since 2018, with specific targets by key materials (nickel, cobalt, and lithium). The European Union proposes to update its EU Battery Directive during 2021 to implement more aggressive recycling targets, including minimum material recovery rates of 90% for both cobalt and nickel by 2025, a minimum recovery rate of 35% for lithium by 2025, and a Recycling Efficiency Rate of least 65% by 2025. Our renewable energy segment holds all licenses currently required in connection with its technologies and operations. We have engaged a third-party consultant to work across all projects, supporting us with permitting and regulatory compliance, and keeping us apprised of all relevant regulations and related changes. 
Our design, engineering, licensing, installation, commissioning and maintenance services are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which require a standard of care to control potential pollution and limit actual or potential impacts to the environment and personnel involved. A violation of these laws and regulations, or of permit conditions, can result in substantial fines, natural resource damage, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns. We do not anticipate a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition as a result of our efforts to comply with these requirements. Operating expenses to meet regulatory requirements, including all environmental permits, will be an integral part of service costs. Costs for compliance with environmental laws include safety and health protection measures, controls limiting air emissions and effluent discharges, emergency response capabilities, storm water management, recordkeeping and training. We often assist our customers in environment, health and safety compliance issues, including new requirements concerning greenhouse gas emissions. It may not be possible to completely segregate our environment, health and safety responsibilities from those of our customers.
Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances, and other matters. We have obtained substantially all licenses, permits, and other authorizations currently required for our mining, exploration and other development programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations. Capital expenditures relating to compliance with laws and regulations that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, comprise a substantial part of our historical capital expenditures and some of our anticipated future capital expenditures. For example, we incur certain expenses and liabilities associated with our reclamation obligations. 
We are generally required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping, and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts are conducted in accordance with plans reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. The Nevada Revised Statutes (“NRS”) 519A to 519A.280 and Nevada Administrative Code (“NAC”) 519A.010 to 519A.415 promulgated by the Nevada State Environmental Commission and the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (“NDEP”), Bureau of Mining and Reclamation (“BMRR”) require a surety bond to be posted for mining projects so that, after completion of the work on such mining projects, the sites are left safe, stable and capable of providing for a productive post-mining use. Over the past four years, the Company has provided a reclamation surety bond, through the Lexon Surety Group (“Lexon”), with the BMRR. The BMRR, with concurrence from Storey County, has approved our most recent reclamation plan, as revised, and our estimated total costs related thereto of approximately $7,251,950, including $6,751,950 for BMRR and $500,000 of additional reclamation surety bonding directly, with Storey County. As part of the surety agreement, the Company agreed to pay a 2.0% 
annual bonding fee and signed a corporate guarantee. The bonded amount is $7,251,950, and the collateral held on deposit at December 31, 2022 is $2,727,815.

Debt Financing Agreements
The Company entered into a long-term promissory note ("GHF 2021 Note") with GHF, Inc. ("GHF") on December 15, 2021, with a principal amount of $5,000,000, of which $4,550,000 was funded and $450,000 was an original issue discount ("OID"). The full principal is due on December 15, 2024. Interest is payable monthly at a rate of 6% annually. Prepayment is allowed in full or in part at any time without premium or penalty. The loan is secured by all non-mining related assets of the Company, Silver Springs land and water rights, and the Daney Ranch, excluding the Lucerne and Dayton properties. The Company is required to prepay the promissory note with any net cash proceeds received in the sale of any collateral. If the promissory note has not been paid in full on or prior to December 15, 2022, the Company will issue warrants to GHF allowing them to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, half of which are exercisable at a price per share of 150% of the 20-day volume weighted average closing price (“VWAP”) of the Company’s common stock on its primary trading market for the 20 consecutive trading days preceding December 15, 2021, and the remainder at a price per share of 135% of the 20-day VWAP as determined on December 15, 2022.
On December 16, 2022, in compliance with the GHF 2021 Note agreement, the Company issued warrants to GHF allowing them to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, 500,000 of which are exercisable at a price per share of $2.5217 and the remaining 500,000 at a price per share of $0.4555. The warrants are exercisable for a period of two years commencing on December 15, 2022, and ending on December 15, 2022. At December 31 2021, the warrants were valued at $708,789. At the time the Company issued the GHF 2021 Note, the Company estimated a 10% probability that the warrants would be issued and recognized an initial discount on the debt of $70,879. In December 2022, the contingency was resolved upon issuing the warrants, the Company recorded an additional $637,910 and the discount on the note was adjusted to reflect the increase. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized interest expense of $715,089, which includes OID amortization of $429,912, and $19,720, respectively, in connection with the GHF 2021 Note.
On August 22, 2022, the Company amended the GHF promissory note’s prepayment provision to reduce the amount required to be paid from the Daney Ranch sale to $710,000. As consideration for the amendment, the Company issued GHF warrants to purchase 200,000 common shares at a price of $1.00 per share. The warrants had a fair value of $18,975 on the date of issuance and was recorded as an additional debt discount with a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital. During the years 
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized interest expense of $715,089 which includes OID amortization of $429,912 and $19,720, respectively, in connection with the GHF 2021 Note.. 
On March 4, 2021, we retired our unsecured promissory notes (“Promissory Notes”) by paying the remaining principal balance of $3.1 million plus earned OID of $0.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, interest expense on the promissory notes was $139,213, which includes OID amortization of $71,289.

Interest is payable monthly at a rate of 9% per annually. Prepayment is allowed in full or in part at any time without premium or penalty. The loan is secured by all of the property commonly referred to as the Dayton properties. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized interest expense of $33,041 and amortization of discount of $45,890 in connection with the Alvin Fund Note. The Company used the proceeds for a $2.0 million payment toward the purchase of a battery metal recycling facility from LINICO. 
On December 16, 2022, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement for an unsecured convertible promissory note ("Ionic Ventures 2022 Convertible Note") with Ionic Ventures, LLC with a principal amount of $3,150,000, of which $2,975,000 was funded and $175,000 was an original issue discount. The full principal is due on March 16, 2024. Interest is payable monthly at a rate of 8% annually. The Company can redeem up to $2,000,000 of the Convertible Note for cash 30-days following closing at 110% of the Face Value, plus accrued interest. The Ionic 2022 Convertible Note contains conversion terms that are based on percentages of trading price and volumes over defined measurement periods. The terms require the conversion option to be bifurcated as a derivative. As of December 31, 2022, the Company bifurcated the conversion feature and recorded a derivative liability of $420,000 reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. The derivative was valued using a Monte Carlo valuation model with a conversion price equal to 90% of the average price capped at $0.50, discount rate of 35%, risk free rate of 4.40%, and volatility of 60.0%. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized interest expense of $10,356 and amortization of discount of $17,161 in connection with the Ionic 2022 Convertible Note. The Company used the net proceeds from this offering for strategic development programs, working capital and general corporate purposes.
