Product and Services
 
Tuffy Packs manufactures a line of custom inserts that provide a level of personal protection from ballistic threats similar to what law enforcement officers wear daily as bullet proof vests. The Tuffy Pack, LLC Ballistic Shields® conform to the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Level IIIA threat requirements. NIJ is the research, development and evaluation agency of the U.S. Department of Justice. NIJ Standard–0101.06, “Ballistic Resistance of Body Armor,” is a minimum performance standard developed in collaboration with the Office of Law Enforcement Standards (OLES) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It is produced as part of the Standards and Testing Program of the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice. This standard is a technical document that specifies the minimum performance requirements that equipment must meet to satisfy the requirements of criminal justice agencies and the methods that shall be used to test this performance. This standard is used by the NIJ Voluntary Compliance Testing Program (CTP) to determine which body armor models meet the minimum performance requirements for inclusion on the NIJ Compliant Products List.

Personal body armor covered by this standard is classified into five types (IIA, II, IIIA, III, IV) by level of ballistic performance. In addition, a special test class is defined to allow armor to be validated against threats that may not be covered by the five standard classes. The classification for the Tuffy Pack product line states;
 
2.3 Type IIIA (.357 SIG; .44 Magnum) Type IIIA armor that is new and unworn shall be tested with .357 SIG FMJ Flat Nose (FN) bullets with a specified mass of 8.1 g (125 gr) and a velocity of 448 m/s ± 9.1 m/s (1470 ft/s ± 30 ft/s) and with .44 Magnum Semi Jacketed Hollow Point (SJHP) bullets with a specified mass of 15.6 g (240 gr) and a velocity of 436 m/s ± 9.1 m/s (1430 ft/s ± 30 ft/s). Type IIIA armor that has been conditioned shall be tested with .357 SIG FMJ FN bullets with a specified mass of 8.1 g (125 gr) and a velocity of 430 m/s ± 9.1 m/s (1410 ft/s ± 30 ft/s) and with .44 Magnum SJHP bullets with a specified mass of 15.6 g (240 gr) and a velocity of 408 m/s ± 9.1 m/s (1340 ft/s ± 30 ft/s).
 
The ballistic shields (collectively, the “Licensed Products”) when inserted into backpacks, briefcases or computer bags will provide the highest level of protection currently available as lightweight concealable body armor. Backpacks with ballistic protection weigh only 16 – 24 ounces more than a non-protected pack (based on the pack size).

Markets
 
Madison sales strategy is to develop online exposure through the use of social media marketing and sending demo packs of the Licensed Products to both online bloggers and established gun owner clubs. The demo packs will include both new products as well as examples of the products that have been tested and exposed to gunfire.
 
Madison also intends to attend European tradeshows and exhibits, including, but not limited to, IDEF (International Defense Industry Fair), ITEC, and GREC (General Police Equipment & Exhibition Conference). These trade shows will assist in introducing the Licensed Products to wholesalers in an attempt to expand Madison’s sales channel.
 
Distribution Methods
 
Madison’s distribution method is to deliver the Licensed Products into the European and UK retail and wholesale markets via the use of online market and fulfillment services including but not limited to Amazon.eu, Ebay Redstag and MCS Fulfillment. By implementing these companies’ services Madison will be able to establish a reliable supply chain that will receive delivery of the Licensed Products, warehouse the Licensed Products, package the Licensed Package as per each customer order, and ship the Licensed Products to the customer efficiently and cost effectively.
 
Management expects to expand Madison’s sales distribution strategy beginning in May 2019 and to be operational by September 2019, this includes the following components:
 
1. Initial inventory with an estimated cost of $10,000
 
2. Social media and online advertising of $10,000
 
Status of Licensed Products
 
The Licensed Products will be supplied exclusively by Tuffy Packs, LLC. Tuffy Packs, LLC already has an established supply chain and is able to supply up to 10,000 units per month. Management believes this monthly supply of Licensed Products will be sufficient for Madison’s anticipated inventory requirements.
Competitive Conditions
 
Madison will be competing with other online retail companies possessing greater financial resources and technical facilities than Madison in connection with the sale of similar products. Many of the competitors have a very diverse portfolio and have not confined their market to one product or line of products, but offer a wide array of products. All of these competitors have been in business for longer than Madison and may have established more strategic partnerships and relationships than Madison.
 
Management believes that it will have a competitive advantage over its competitors due to its plan of operations.
 
Madison has identified numerous body armor and bullet proof inserts available from a variety of online and offline merchants, and although most offer international shipping to the United Kingdom and Western Europe, the high cost of shipping and long delays in delivery makes purchasing from a US based retailer unattractive. Management believes that by establishing relationships with fulfillment companies and having stock on hand in its distribution territories Madison will have a competitive advantage in the ability to fill orders and deliver the Licensed Products to its customers quickly which will develop buyer loyalty.
 
Madison has also identified several online retailers that are located in either the UK or Europe that supply products that management believes would be in direct competition with Madison’s business. Some of those competitors include, but not limited to, the following:
 

● | Vestgaurd - a UK based supplies the very best in British manufactured ballistic protection systems for personal and vehicle protection to the public and private sectors. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Mars Armor - a Bulgarian company specialized in the manufacture of body armor for protection against bullets, fragments and cold steel. 
● | Spycatcher Online - a UK based supplier of specialist surveillance, counter-surveillance and personal protection equipment to the professional and consumer market. 
● | Jack Ellis Body Protection - a UK based manufacturer in the personal protection market with clients including - UK and Foreign government organizations, special forces, police, prisons, private security and media.
