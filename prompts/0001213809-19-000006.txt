Item 1. | Business

Overview
Dyadic International, Inc. (“Dyadic”, “we”, or the “Company”) is a global biotechnology platform company based in Jupiter, Florida with operations in the United States, a satellite office in the Netherlands and research organizations performing services under contract to Dyadic in Finland and Spain. Over the past two decades, the Company has developed a gene expression platform for producing commercial quantities of industrial enzymes and other proteins, and has previously licensed this technology to third parties, such as Abengoa Bioenergy, BASF, Codexis and others, for use in industrial (non-pharmaceutical) applications. This technology is based on the Myceliophthora thermophila fungus, which the Company named C1. The C1 technology is a robust and versatile fungal expression system for the development and production of enzymes and other proteins.
3

On December 31, 2015, the Company sold its industrial technology business to DuPont Danisco (“DuPont”), the industrial biosciences business of DuPont (NYSE: DD) for $75.0 million (the “DuPont Transaction”). As part of the DuPont Transaction, Dyadic retained co-exclusive rights to the C1 technology for use in all human and animal pharmaceutical applications, and currently has the exclusive ability to enter into sub-license agreements (subject to the terms of the license and certain exceptions). DuPont retained certain rights to utilize the C1 technology in pharmaceutical applications, including the development and production of pharmaceutical products, for which it will be required to make royalty payments to Dyadic upon commercialization. In certain circumstances, Dyadic may owe a royalty to either DuPont or certain licensors of DuPont, depending upon whether Dyadic elects to utilize certain patents either owned by DuPont or licensed in by DuPont.
After the DuPont Transaction, the Company has been focused on the biopharmaceutical industry, specifically in further improving and applying the proprietary C1 technology into a safe and efficient gene expression platform to help speed up the development, lower production costs and improve the performance of biologic vaccines and drugs at flexible commercial scales. We believe that the C1 technology could be beneficial in the development and manufacturing of human and animal vaccines (such as virus-like particles (VLPs) and antigens), monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), Bi-Specific antibodies, Fab antibody fragments, Fc-Fusion proteins, and other therapeutic enzymes and proteins. The Company is aiming to develop such products as innovative vaccines and drugs, biosimilars and/or biobetters. Additionally, in early 2018, we began to conduct certain funded research activities to further understand if, or how the C1 technology may be applied for use in developing and manufacturing certain metabolites. The initial data from this metabolite project, where the Phase I data milestone was achieved, demonstrated that C1 has the potential to be engineered to produce certain metabolites. In the first quarter of 2019, the Company initiated two new internal research projects, including engineering C1 to express adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) which has been reported as expensive and in short supply.
Our Technology
The Company believes that the C1 cell line is unique in its growth and production capabilities compared to traditional filamentous fungal cells, and the C1 gene expression platform has the potential to be used in the discovery, development and manufacturing of biologic medicines and vaccines, given its anticipated competitive advantages compared to other leading pharmaceutical expression systems, such as CHO (“Chinese Hamster Ovary”) cells. Specifically, the C1 cell line has:

• | A unique morphology which translates into better growth conditions and very high secreted protein yield and has been used in industrial production for 20 years at up to 500,000-liter scale.


• | Several significant potential operational advantages include:


◦ | High productivity and low-cost synthetic media for the upstream fermentation steps


◦ | Potential for greater protein yield for certain downstream processing steps due to the high purity of secreted proteins


◦ | No virus-like particles or virus carryover from production cells which eliminates two purification steps typical for CHO production; low pH viral inactivation and virus nano filtration


• | Wide pH and temperature operating conditions which has the potential to translate into more reliable and robust production processes.


• | Shorter production cycle times than CHO which translates into the following time savings:


◦ | A significant reduction of the inoculation steps in comparison to CHO can be achieved with C1 fermentation. Fermentation with C1 culture will need only 12 - 14 days to qualify the inoculum from a working cell culture to the production bioreactor, instead of 41-54 days in the case of CHO culture.


◦ | Fermentation cycle time of 5-7 days which is 1/2 to 1/3rd the typical fermentation production time of CHO

C1 technology has the potential to become an alternative gene expression platform to CHO, E.coli, yeast, insect cells, and other organisms currently in use for developing and manufacturing protein-based biologics because of C1’s potential speed of development and low production costs.
Our Industry and Markets
Our research collaborations and ongoing discussions with leading pharmaceutical and biotech companies, contract manufacturing organizations (CMO’s), leading academic institutions, as well as U.S. and foreign governmental agencies continue to support the Company’s belief that the biopharmaceutical market is an attractive opportunity to apply the C1 technology. The Company is focused on penetrating the biologics market in the following segments:

• | Recombinant vaccines market for both human and animal health markets

4


• | New innovative biologic therapeutics


• | Biosimilars / Biobetters non-Glycosylated protein market


• | Biosimilars / Biobetters Glycosylated protein market


• | Metabolites / Primary & Secondary


• | Viral Vectors / Adeno-Associated Viral Vectors (AAV)

The use of biologic medicines, such as antibodies, is growing significantly. However, biologic medicines are very expensive for both patients and health care systems, and the Company believes that such high cost is in part the result of the following bottlenecks in the development and manufacture of biologic medicines:

• | Low yielding and often slower gene expression systems currently used by the biopharmaceutical industry


• | Expensive, often royalty stacked, cell-media in the case of CHO cell lines


• | Long production time in the case of CHO cell lines


• | Previous underfunded development efforts for a more efficient next generation gene expression system


• | The biopharmaceutical industry’s reluctance to utilize certain advances to develop next generation gene expression systems for bio-manufacturing, such as application of cutting-edge synthetic biology, metabolic and glyco-engineering tools to generate more productive microorganisms with differentiating properties

The Company believes that the biopharmaceutical industry would benefit from a next generation expression platform that is safe, reliable, productive and cost effective to produce more affordable biologic medicines in larger volumes using smaller fermentation vessels. The Company also believes that by further engineering our C1 technology it will have the potential to be an alternative to CHO and other expression systems for certain biologic vaccines and drugs.
Our Business Development Efforts
The Company continues to attempt to raise the commercial, scientific and technical profile of its C1 technology through the following targeted business development efforts:

• | Numerous presentations and interviews at various biopharmaceutical and industry conferences;


• | Business development meetings with biopharmaceutical and biotech companies, contract manufacturing organizations, and industry thought leaders around the world;


• | Scientific meetings with interested parties within academia, industry and governmental agencies in Europe, North America, Asia, Israel and elsewhere;


• | Updated Company’s website, media interviews and renewed marketing presentation materials.

Since the closing of the DuPont Transaction in December 2015, the Company has achieved the following in its business development initiatives:

• | Retained two new board members who previously worked in senior level positions at Merck and Pfizer, are both members of the U.S. Academy of Engineers and have strong scientific background and extensive business experience in the biopharmaceutical industry;


• | Entered into more than 100 Non-Disclosure (NDA’s) and Material Transfer Agreements (MTA’s) with pharmaceutical and biotech companies, contract manufacturing organizations, leading academic institutions, and U.S. and foreign governmental parties;


• | Entered into more than a dozen feasibility and expression projects and collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotech companies, leading academic institutions and governmental labs, such as Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma and The Israel Institute for Biological Research (“IIBR”);


• | Extended our collaboration with The University of Iowa using C1 cells with genes of interest;


• | We trained the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) (a part of the University of Oxford) and the Fraunhofer USA Center for Molecular Biotechnology on how to express genes using C1, because they were experiencing difficulty using their existing gene expression platforms;


• | We have begun to work with leading providers of resins and filtration equipment as we begin to develop a C1 downstream purification process for Certolizuma.

Potential Opportunity to Use C1 in Drug Discovery and Early Development Process
While our focus has been and remains on developing stable C1 cell lines for use in helping to speed up the development, lower production costs, improve the performance of biologic vaccines and to develop drugs at flexible commercial scales, we have identified a new area where C1 may add value based on our discussions with various pharmaceutical and biotech companies. This new area is the biologics drug discovery and early development process, which requires sufficient levels of protein to be expressed as quickly as possible in order to identify new drug candidates within a limited time. Currently, HEK 293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells) are commonly used for this application.
Given that C1 cells have proved the capability to express and produce comparable and even larger quantities of protein than HEK 293 cells, we believe that C1 has the potential to help overcome certain protein expression challenges in the biologics drug discovery and development stages. To capitalize on this opportunity, we will need to spend additional resources to modify our C1 technology for this application. We are in discussions with interested third parties, including our existing collaborators, to determine our next steps and potential funding.
The Company believes that the unique attributes of C1, together with our platform research and development programs, has the potential to create attractive research, licensing, partnering/collaboration and other revenue and funding opportunities in the animal and human biopharmaceutical industries. The funded research projects mentioned above and others that we are actively seeking may help defray some of our research expenses, as we continue to develop and demonstrate the potential of our C1 technology. The Company will continue seeking research collaboration opportunities and partners to potentially commercialize C1-based products.
Our Research Partners and Contract Research Organizations (CROs)
After the closing of DuPont Transaction, we initially conducted our research and development work on C1 at DuPont’s research center in Wageningen, The Netherlands, Dyadic’s former C1 research and development center that was acquired by DuPont in the DuPont Transaction on December 31, 2015 (“DuPont Research Center”). On September 30, 2017, the Company concluded the research services provided by DuPont, and successfully transitioned the C1 platform research programs to the following two contract research organizations:
(1) Research and Development Agreement with the Prime CRO, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Ltd
In September 2016, the Company entered into a multi-year research and development agreement with VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Ltd, a third-party Contract Research Organization, (the “Prime CRO”, or “VTT”) to begin to further modify and improve the Company’s C1 technology to be a safe and efficient expression system for use in speeding up development and lowering the cost of manufacturing pharmaceutical products and processes. VTT is one of the leading research and technology organizations in Europe, and it has conducted research and development on fungi and other microorganisms for more than three decades. We believe that VTT has the required skills and experience in fungal strain development to help us further develop our C1 technology and achieve our goal and objectives.
The initial multi-year research and development agreement with VTT expired in March of 2019. We have entered into an amendment to extend this research and development agreement until June 15, 2019 while we negotiate new terms and conditions of future research and development.
(2) Collaboration Agreement with BDI
On June 30, 2017, the Company entered into a strategic Research Services Agreement (the “RSA”) with Biotechnology Developments for Industry in Pharmaceuticals, S.L.U. (“BDI Pharma”), and a Service Framework Agreement (the “SFA”, and together with the RSA, the “R&D Agreements”), with VLP The Vaccines Company, S.L.U. (“VLPbio”), both of which companies are subsidiaries of Biotechnology Developments for Industry, S.L., a Spanish biotechnology company (“BDI Holdings” and together with BDI Pharma and VLPbio, “BDI”).
The R&D Agreements provide a framework under which the parties will engage in a research and development collaboration encompassing several different projects over approximately a two-year period, with a focus on advancing Dyadic’s proprietary C1 technology in the development of next generation biological vaccines and drugs. Dyadic expects to leverage the BDI team’s previous C1 gene expression and industrial fermentation scale-up and commercialization experience with yeast and filamentous fungi processes to further advance Dyadic’s proprietary C1 technology with the potential to commercialize certain biopharmaceutical product(s). All the data and any products developed from the funded research projects will be owned by Dyadic. We anticipate that BDI will conduct gene expression work and cGMP media development coupled with fermentation optimization 
6

work, with a goal of improving the C1 technology’s production process for manufacturing vaccines, antibodies, enzymes and other therapeutic proteins. Additionally, BDI is conducting research and development on our behalf to express and produce a variety of C1-based biologic products to demonstrate C1’s capabilities and to identify potential animal and human pharmaceutical products which may be out licensed to third parties for commercialization. Those proteins include mAbs, Fc-Fusion, Bi-specific antibodies, Fabs, VLP and others that may be used for human and animal health applications.
Upon closing of the BDI transaction, the Company paid EUR €1 million in cash to engage BDI to develop designated C1 based product candidates and further improve the C1 manufacturing process, in consideration of which Dyadic also received a 16.1% equity interest in BDI Holdings and a 3.3% equity interest in VLPbio. BDI is obligated to spend a minimum amount of EUR €936,000 over two years in the conduct of the research and development project under the RSA, and approximately 76% of the amount has been spent as of December 31, 2018. If the research and development activities produce a product that is selected for additional development and commercialization, then Dyadic expects to share with BDI a range of between 50% and 75% of the net income from such selected product, depending upon the amount of BDI’s aggregate spend in the development of the selected product, with a minimum aggregate spend by BDI of EUR €1 million for a 50% share and EUR €8 million for a 75% share. If BDI does not enter into an agreement with Dyadic for such additional development and commercialization of the selected product, then Dyadic will pay to BDI the first EUR €1.5 million of the net income from Dyadic’s commercialization, if any, of the selected product. We anticipate that we will need to provide additional funding together with other third parties to continue the further development and commercialization of the selected product. In addition, under the SFA, Dyadic agreed to purchase from BDI at least USD $1 million in contract research services specified by Dyadic over two years since the closing of the BDI transaction. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has funded approximately 93% of this amount. In addition to the funded research programs that are being conducted by BDI for the Company, BDI has also carried out research programs on behalf of the Company for third parties.
Other shareholders of BDI include the founders of BDI and Inveready, an independent Spanish venture capital firm who among other ares of interest, specialize in biotechnology.
Our Research and Development (“R&D”) Programs
The Company’s current research and development activities are focused on the following biopharmaceutical programs:
(1) Internal Research Programs
C1 Production Host Improvement Programs
The Company has contracted the Prime CRO to further improve the C1 technology to become an even more robust, versatile and efficient therapeutic protein production platform which may be used to help bring biologic vaccines and drugs to market faster, in greater volumes, at lower cost, and with new properties to drug developers and manufacturers. This includes: (i) improving the genome sequence-accuracy for the application of system biology tools, (ii) improving the C1 genetic tools, (iii) further reducing the background protease(s) levels by identifying and deleting certain protease genes and/or modifying C1 fermentation processes, (iv) developing high expression C1 cell lines by genetic modifications where one or more specific integration sites are being used to increase productivity and to what we expect will help with future regulatory approvals, and (v) modify the glycosylation pathway of C1 cells in order for C1 to express certain mAbs and other proteins with mammalian like glycosylation structures and to eliminate unwanted glycan structures such as O-glycosylation.
We have made certain improvements to our C1 technology platform through our collaborations with the Prime CRO, and BDI.

• | Data demonstrating C1’s capability to express a variety of types of vaccines and therapeutic proteins including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), Fab antibody fragments, Fc-Fusion proteins, and difficult-to-express genes such as virus-like particles (VLPs), Bi-Specific antibodies, and antigens, at a higher productivity level than other gene expression platforms.


• | Data form a large pharma collaborator demonstrating that the binding kinetics of mAbs produced from C1 are virtually indistinguishable from the binding kinetics of reference mAbs which were produced in CHO cells.


• | Successfully expressed a third party bi-specific antibody which was assayed by the third party in an in vitro cellular activity assay which indicated that dose response curves for the C1 expressed bi-specific antibody were very similar to the CHO expressed bi-specific antibody.


• | Generated C1 strains that have lower background protease activity, while remaining healthy and viable.

7


• | Created a C1 protease expression library to quickly identify and eliminate protease genes to improve protein stability and productivity.


• | Developed and used a variety of novel genetic elements, molecular tools that can be used in biologics vaccine and drug development and manufacturing.


• | Demonstrated that C1 can be grown not only in stainless steel fermenters, but that C1 can also be grown in single use bioreactors (SUB). We conducted multiple bioreactor experiments using a 50L XDR-50MO Single Use GE bioreactor which showed that the expression level (productivity of 9.2 g/l) was virtually identical to the productivity achieved in the Stainless-Steel Bioreactor control that was based on an earlier C1 Certolizumab strain and process. 


• | Improved C1 fed batch fermentation process with low cost defined media, as compared to the expensive, complex growth media being used with CHO. Continue optimizing both the media and the fermentation process to further increase mAb and other protein yields and productivity.

Glycosylated Therapeutic Programs
The Company’s longer-term objective, which will require substantially more time and additional capital is to apply the C1 technology for the large therapeutic glycoprotein market. We believe that the rapid advances being made in genomics and synthetic biology, make the C1 fungal cell line a promising candidate to further engineer glycosylation pathways: (i) to produce therapeutic proteins having human like glycoforms structures such as G0, G1, G2, G0F, G1F and G2F; (ii) to reduce or eliminate O-glycosylation; and (iii) to create potentially improved immunogenicity in the case of vaccines.
The initial steps to develop C1 strains that produce mAbs with mammalian-like glycosylation are progressing well at the Prime CRO, and we are actively working on additional steps. The remaining work according to the research plan is anticipated to last through year end 2020 with a goal of reaching C1 cell lines that produce proteins with G1F and G2F glycan structures. Based on research results we have to date, the Company believes that our C1 technology has the potential to become a useful platform for the development and production of therapeutic glycoproteins with human-like or potentially even superior glycan structures. We believe that, if successful, the glycoengineering of C1 cells may help to position the C1 technology to be an important production platform for developing and manufacturing glycosylated antibodies and other glycoproteins.
Although we have made good progress working with the Prime CRO since September 2016, there remains additional work and data needed to develop our C1 technology into a potentially safe and efficient expression system for use in speeding up the development and lowering the cost of animal and human biologic vaccines and drugs.
(2) Biologic Vaccines Programs - ZAPI
We continue our participation in the ZAPI vaccination program. ZAPI (www.zapi-imi.eu) is a research and development project funded as part of IMI EU program (Zoonoses Anticipation and Preparedness Initiative (ZAPI project; IMI Grant Agreement n°115760)), with the assistance and partial financial support of IMI and the European Commission, and in-kind contributions from EFPIA partners. This project aims to develop a suitable platform for the rapid development and production of vaccines and protocols to fast-track registration of product developed to combat pandemic Zoonotic diseases that have the potential to affect human and animal populations. If the C1 antigens are used within the ZAPI project, there will be additional performance and safety data which we would expect to help us in our efforts to apply the C1 expression system for use in developing and manufacturing vaccines across the broader animal and human health industries.
The Company’s C1 expressed antigens were tested in a very small mice study within the ZAPI project and the data indicated that the C1 technology produced antigen generated an immune response in mice that protected the mice and showed no negative effects on the health of the mice. We anticipate that more immunogenicity and safety testing will be conducted within the ZAPI project in the months and years ahead.
We believe that our efforts to demonstrate C1’s ability to express antigens at target levels set by the ZAPI consortium have been met or exceeded. For example, we were asked to focus on expressing a specific antigen against the Schmallenberg virus (SBV), and the data obtained so far has indicated promising high expression levels of this antigen which we anticipate will be transferred to other groups within ZAPI who may carry out additional animal trials. The target expression level of the antigen against the Schmallenberg virus (SBV) was stated by ZAPI at the beginning of the project to be 100 mg/l, we have been able to demonstrate C1 expression levels of this antigen at approximately 17 times (17X) that level or ~ 1780 mg/l. In addition, the ELISA and Western Blot analysis results confirmed that the C1-expressed protein has similar performance as antigen produced by baculovirus and it was correctly folded. However, it is important to note that the C1 expressed immunogen has not been evaluated 
8

yet in the target species and is thus at the time being not “validated”. If successful, C1 may eventually be validated as the preferred production host for the production of ZAPI’s antigens.
(3) Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR)
In the first quarter of 2018, we entered into a research and development collaboration with the Israel Institute for Biological Research (“IIBR”) to further advance our C1 expression platform for the development and manufacture of recombinant vaccines and neutralizing agents comprising targeted antigens and monoclonal antibodies (biologics), to combat emerging diseases and threats.
This project provides us with an opportunity to work with a renowned organization, aiming to integrate our C1 gene expression platform into an end to end product development and manufacturing capability to produce biologics, and if possible, to get some of these biologics through the regulatory approval process. All of the collaboration work is to be performed at IIBR’s laboratories using their in-house resources.
We are in discussion with the IIBR to work together on co-funded research projects, one of which is to demonstrate the ability of using VLP's produced in C1 as a more efficient method to produce a specific vaccine currently being produced using another gene expression platform. The IIBR has the knowhow and the supporting analysis both, in-vitro and in-vivo, for evaluation of the produced C1 VLP vaccine. 
(4) Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), Fc-Fusion, and Fab
The Company has a number of internally and externally funded research programs to express different types of therapeutic proteins including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), Bi-Specific antibodies, Fab antibody fragments, and Fc-Fusion proteins using our C1 technology. So far, we have been able to demonstrate C1’s ability to express an IgG mAb at 9 grams per liter (g/l) in 90 hours which equates to 2.4 grams per liter per day (g/l/d), a Fab antibody fragment at 2.6 g/l/d, a Fc-Fusion protein at 1.74 g/l/d as well as other proteins at various expression levels. The Company believes that such results are promising and show greater productivity potential of C1 compared to the average expression yields of CHO cells which is the predominant production system used to manufacture glycosylated mAbs-derived biopharmaceutical drugs.
In December 2016 and May 2017, the Company entered into two funded feasibility and expression research projects with two of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, respectively. The first project was successfully completed in the last quarter of 2017, and the second one was successfully completed in the second quarter of 2018. We believe that the data generated to date from these collaborations, and otherwise, continues to demonstrate the potential of the C1 technology to produce high levels of glycosylated mAbs and other therapeutic proteins faster, with higher productivity and at a much lower cost than that can be achieved using CHO cells. However, in order to potentially commercialize or capitalize on C1’s potential in producing glycoproteins, we will need to complete the glycoengineering of C1 to be able to demonstrate a variety of biological and analytical data related to performance, stability and safety.
(5) Mitsubishi Tanabe Program
In the first quarter of 2018, we entered into a collaboration with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp. to express two of its therapeutic compounds using our C1 production platform. This research and development program is aiming to help Mitsubishi Tanabe overcome specific gene expression challenges and to further demonstrate the potential of C1 to become a platform for manufacturing protein-based biologics because of its speed of development, high productivity and low production costs. This research program has been successful in terms of generating C1 strains and fermentation processes with higher productivity for one of the Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma proteins. The next steps in this collaboration is for the Company to send samples of the C1 expressed protein for further analytical and biochemical characterization which will be carried out by a third-party lab under the direction and expense of Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma. If this challenging gene expression program is successful, we expect this project to generate additional data and to increase the diversity of the types of proteins that further demonstrates that our C1 platform can help overcome gene expression challenges being faced by pharmaceutical and biotech companies and that such proteins can continue to move through Pre-clinical, Phase1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials rather than being shelved or unnecessarily delayed and that they can be produced at higher yields and with lower cost when commercialized.
(6) Sanofi-Aventis Program
In September 2018, we entered into a funded proof of concept research collaboration with Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, a company of the Sanofi group, one of the World’s top tier biopharmaceutical companies. This research collaboration is to use our C1 platform to express multiple types of therapeutic compounds, aiming to overcome specific gene expression challenges 
9

and to further demonstrate the potential of C1 to become a platform of choice for manufacturing protein-based vaccine and biologic drugs.
This research collaboration is proceeding according to plan, and the initial expression data for certain of the Sanofi-Aventis proteins are already higher than specified target expression levels, and we anticipate that these production levels can be further improved.
(7) Potential Commercialization Program at BDI
Under our collaboration program with BDI, we have begun to evaluate a Virus Like Particle (VLP) and a basket of therapeutic proteins that are commonly used to produce animal and human biopharmaceutical vaccines and drugs, either glycosylated or non-glycosylated proteins (including mAbs, Fabs, and bi-specific mAbs, etc.) to determine which, if any, of these proteins might be potential candidates for future commercialization.
We were able to demonstrate that C1 is capable of expressing certain types of antibodies at various yield levels as well as the ability to express other therapeutic proteins, which are difficult-to-express by other cell lines. In particular:

• | A Secreted Virus Like Particle (VLP) monomers was expressed by C1 and appears to have been properly assembled to form a 60-mers protein structure. Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM) analysis confirmed the correct structure of the VLP.


• | Our first and initial attempt to express Blinatumomab, a bi-specific drug, was successful as the initial unoptimized expression level was 0.6 g/l (0.12 g/l/d). Blinatumomab is a new type of treatment for leukemia, developed by Amgen, with a rapidly growing market. The initial expression level of Blinatumomab is a start in generating data that we believe will help us to demonstrate the potential of C1 to be used as a production host for expressing more complex and difficult to express drugs such as bi-specific antibodies.


• | We have reached the expression level of the antibody fragment Certolizumab using C1 as high as 12.0 g/l in 112 hours (2.6 g/l/d). Certolizumab is a constituting part of Cimzia Pegol, which is a recombinant, humanized and pegylated Fab antibody fragment. We are currently continuing the development work on optimizing the upstream and the downstream processes in order to establish a well-defined production process that will be ready for further non-clinical and clinical studies. In addition, we expect to conduct a variety of comparability and quality analytics with the C1 expressed Certolizumab together with our partnership with BDI and other third parties.

(8) Other Market Opportunities
In January 2018, the Company entered into a funded proof of concept research collaboration with an integrated, global biotech company to use metabolic modeling, synthetic biology and genome engineering techniques to demonstrate the benefits of using C1 as a primary metabolite-producing host organism. We believe that the knowledge and data generated in this program is expected to enhance our understanding of C1’s metabolic characteristics and help us in advancing our ongoing C1 biologic vaccine and drug research and development programs. Despite the Phase 1 milestone being achieved in this research project, we are uncertain at this time whether this research collaboration will continue to be funded by the third-party collaborator. The Company may decide to continue internally funding such project all the way to product commercialization or may at some point in the future seek third party funding in one or more collaborations, licensing or form other types of alternative structure(s), to further develop and monetize this opportunity.
We have entered into two research collaborations in the animal health industry, both companion and farm animals. One of these research collaborations was entered in the first quarter of 2019, and the other one was entered in the third quarter of 2018 where a C1 expressed protein is being further characterized and analyzed for its biological activity, comparability and immunogenicity among other analytical characteristics by our third-party collaborator. 
In January of 2019, the Company initiated an internal research project to express adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV). 
Competition
We believe our C1 Expression System has the potential to become a viable alternative to the current leading expression systems used in the biopharmaceuticals industry to produce vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and other therapeutic proteins. C1 has several inherent benefits and competitive advantages compared to the industry standard expression systems for biologics such as CHO cells, E. coli, and Pichia as detailed below: 
10


• | Mammalian cells: Currently the preferred hosts for most complex protein therapeutics due mainly to their high compatibility with human glycosylation. This market is dominated by CHO cells. Disadvantages include the relatively long time for cell line development, unstable gene expression, and low protein yields.


• | Bacterial: Bacteria such as E. coli produce toxic and pyrogenic cell wall components that may make them unsuitable for the production of pharmaceutical or food components. However, they are currently the easiest, cheapest, and quickest method for recombinant protein expression and are often used in laboratory settings.


• | Yeast: In contrast to bacteria, yeast, such as Pichia, does not produce potentially toxic and pyrogenic cell wall components. Further, the genetic tools for yeast development are advanced and enable continued engineering of new strains that may become more suitable than CHO cell lines.


• | Insect Cells: Insect cells offer protein expression with posttranslational modifications similar to mammalian cells, ease of scale-up, and simplified cell growth readily adapted to high-density suspension culture for large-scale expression. Baculovirus expression systems are used for producing recombinant protein expression in insect cells.

Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 6 employees located in the United States, and 2 key consultants located in Europe. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
Potential reverse stock split
On June 6, 2018 at the annual shareholder meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved a proposal to amend Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio up to 1-for-4 and effective upon a date, in each case, to be determined by the Company's board of directors. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Potential Reverse Stock Split and Potential Listing on the NASDAQ or another National Stock Market.”
Form 10 Registration
The Company filed its initial Form 10 Registration Statement (the “Form 10”) with the SEC on January 14, 2019, which became effective on February 12, 2019. 
Potential NASDAQ Listing
On January 17, 2019, the Company filed an application to list its common stock on NASDAQ Capital Markets Exchange. We expect that our application will be approved by NASDAQ provided we maintain the minimum stock price requirement and clear the outstanding comments that NASDAQ has regarding the application.
