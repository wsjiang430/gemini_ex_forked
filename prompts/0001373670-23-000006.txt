ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Green Brick Partners, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Green Brick”, “the Company”, “we” or “us”) is a diversified homebuilding and land development company. We acquire and develop land and build homes through our eight brands of builders in five major markets. Our core markets are in the high growth U.S. metropolitan areas of Dallas-Fort Worth (“DFW”) and Austin, Texas, Atlanta, Georgia, as well as the Treasure Coast, Florida area and Colorado Springs, Colorado. We are engaged in all aspects of the homebuilding process, including land acquisition and development, entitlements, design, construction, title and mortgage services, marketing and sales and the creation of brand images at our residential neighborhoods and master planned communities. 
We believe we offer higher quality homes with more distinctive designs and floor plans than those built by our competitors at comparable prices. Many of our communities are located in premium locations and we seek to enhance homebuyer satisfaction by utilizing high-quality materials, offering a broad range of customization options and building well-crafted homes. We seek to maximize value over the long term and operate our business to mitigate risks in the event of a downturn by controlling costs and quickly reacting to regional and local market trends.
We are a leading lot developer in our markets and believe that our strict operating discipline provides us with a competitive advantage in seeking to maximize returns while minimizing risk. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or controlled approximately 25,500 home sites in high-growth submarkets throughout the DFW, Austin, and Atlanta metropolitan areas and the Treasure Coast, Florida market. We provide finished lots to our subsidiary builders or option lots from third-party developers for our builders’ homebuilding operations and provide them with construction funding and strategic planning. Our Atlanta and Florida builders provide us with their local knowledge and relationships. 
We are a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 2006. We commenced operations as a publicly held homebuilding company in 2014. Our principal executive offices are located at 2805 Dallas Pkwy, Ste 400, Plano, TX 75093. 
Business Strategy
We believe we are well-positioned for growth through the disciplined execution of the following elements of our strategy: 
•Consistent Land Acquisition Program with Disciplined Underwriting. We believe our ability to identify, acquire and develop land in desirable locations and on favorable terms is critical to our success. We evaluate land opportunities based on how we expect such opportunities will contribute to overall profitability and returns. Through our rigorous national underwriting program, we seek to identify attractive properties that are typically located in prime neighborhood locations or in preferred growth corridors. We focus on the development of entitled parcels in communities where we can generally sell all homes within 24 to 60 months from the start of sales. Notwithstanding, we will also invest in longer-term land investments if our return criteria is generated. 
•Focus on Markets with a Favorable Growth Outlook and Strong Demand Fundamentals. We have chosen to focus our operations to sunbelt and sunbelt adjacent states because we believe that these markets offer attractive residential real estate investment characteristics, such as growing economies, improving levels of employment, and population growth relative to national averages, favorable migration patterns, general housing affordability, and desirable lifestyle and weather characteristics. We currently generate income from home sales in Texas, Colorado, Florida, and Georgia. Each of these states experienced double-digit growth between 2010 and 2020 while the population of the US only grew 7.3%. In 2022, Texas, Florida and Georgia were ranked first, second and fourth, respectively in terms of population growth according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
•Strategically Increase Market Positions in our Existing Markets. We believe that there are significant opportunities to profitably expand in our core markets. As of December 31, 2022, we believe our extensive land and lot inventory will allow us to maximize our profitability and return on capital. In DFW, Austin, and Atlanta, we seek to acquire land with convenient access to metropolitan areas which have diverse economic and employment bases and demographics that we believe will support long-term growth. In the Treasure Coast, we seek land in highly desirable, but limited, coastal regions that attract relocating homebuyers. We continuously review the allocation of our investments in these markets taking into account demographic trends and the likely impact on our operating results and will reallocate our investments when necessary. 
•Deliver Superior Designs, Broad Product Ranges and Enhanced Homebuying Experience. We partner our expertise with that of our builders to design attractive neighborhoods and homes to appeal to a wide variety of potential homebuyers. Our homebuilding projects include townhomes, patio homes, single family homes, and luxury homes. We believe we can adapt quickly to changing market conditions and optimize performance and returns while strategically reducing portfolio risk because of our diversified product strategy. One of our core operating philosophies 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

is to create a culture which provides a positive, memorable experience for our homebuyers. In consultation with nationally and locally recognized architecture firms, interior and exterior consultants, and homeowner focus groups, we research and design a diversified range of products for various levels and price points.
•Disciplined Investment Strategy Combined with the Prudent Use of Leverage. We seek to maximize value over the long-term and operate our business to mitigate risks in the event of a downturn by controlling costs and focusing on regional and local market trends. We believe that our strict operating discipline combined with our prudent use of financial leverage to continue to invest in our land acquisition, development and homebuilding businesses provides us with a competitive advantage in seeking to maximize returns while minimizing risk. We target a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 30% to 35%, which we expect will continue to provide us with significant additional growth capital. As of December 31, 2022, our debt to total capitalization ratio was 25.7%.
•Targeted Expansion into Adjacent Markets. We currently intend to pursue targeted expansion of our entry-level builder, Trophy Signature Homes, into markets within our current states. We believe Trophy’s more affordable product and quicker inventory turns make its platform uniquely scalable to expand outside of the DFW metroplex. We plan to expand Trophy into markets compatible with our existing markets that demonstrate strong trends in demographics, employment, and in-migration by leveraging existing relationships with land developers and homebuilders. In this regard, in February 2022, we began our expansion into the Austin, TX market. In addition, we have traditionally, and may in the future, grow through the acquisition of homebuilders in our current markets or other markets that meet our demographic and economic growth criteria.

(2)GB Challenger is not included in the table above as Green Brick does not have a controlling financial interest in Challenger. Our investment in Challenger is treated as an unconsolidated investment under the equity method of accounting and is included in investments in unconsolidated entities in our consolidated balance sheets.
In response to our customers expressed desire for an expedited and transparent sales process, we offer a selection of homes with simplified, all upgrades included options. Our Trophy Signature Homes and CB JENI X lines have been at the forefront of creating an honest, easy to follow, sales experience that seeks to offer simplified solutions with top-of-the-line finishes regardless of a homebuyer’s price range. We believe that this streamlined process and focus on operational efficiency has enabled us to react quickly to the rise of the work from home lifestyle of our homebuyers. As a result, we have launched updated plans with a focus on dedicated office spaces, home integrations with the newest technology, and the latest in energy-efficient solutions including tankless water heaters, high-efficiency LED lighting, ENERGY STAR rated appliances, and low flow bathroom fixtures.
We are focused on creating environmentally sustainable products, and our purchasing power enables us to include green features in our homes. Each new home we build is healthier and more energy efficient, and has less impact on the environment than prior generations of homes as a result of features like:
•Low-VOC paint that reduces pollution;
•WaterSense® faucets that reduce water flow without sacrificing performance;
• Low-E windows that reduce infrared and ultraviolet light coming into the home; and
•Energy Star® appliances that reduce energy consumption.
Land Policy
Our land inventory strategy strives to provide us with a multi-year supply of lots for each of our brands for future homebuilding while limiting excess supply that would be subject to market cycle risk. With certain exceptions, we focus on the development of entitled parcels in communities where we can generally sell all lots and homes within 24 to 60 months from the start of sales. This focus allows us to limit exposure to land development and land risks while pursuing favorable returns on our investments. We seek to minimize our exposure to land risk through disciplined management of entitlements, the use of land and lot options, and other flexible land acquisition arrangements. We are actively involved in every step of the land entitlement, home design, and construction processes with our builders. 
Our land teams focus on acquiring well located land that will position us to deliver future earnings growth in 2023 and beyond. As of December 31, 2022, we had 25,527 lots owned and controlled. When excluding land held for future development, as of December 31, 2022, we had 18,952 lots owned and controlled.

Marketing and Sales Process
We sell our homes primarily from models that we have designed and constructed. We employ new home consultants who are paid salaries, commissions or both to conduct on-site sales of our homes. Our in-house sales force typically works from sales offices located in model homes in or near each community. Sales representatives assist potential buyers by providing them with basic floor plans, price information, development and construction timetables, virtual and in-person tours of model homes, and upgrade options. Sales personnel are trained by us and generally have had prior experience selling new homes in the local market. Our personnel, along with subcontracted marketing and design consultants, carefully design the exterior and interior of each home to appeal to the lifestyles of targeted homebuyers. We also sell homes through independent realtors. 
We offer a preferred lender referral program through our mortgage joint venture to provide lending options to homebuyers in need of financing. We also offer homeowners a comprehensive warranty on each home. Homes are generally covered by an eight to ten-year warranty for structural concerns, one year for defects and products used, and two years for electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning parts and labor. 
Our marketing strategy has increasingly involved advertising through digital channels including real estate listing sites, paid search, display advertising, social media, and e-mail marketing, all of which drive traffic to our builders’ websites. This has allowed us to attract more qualified and knowledgeable homebuyers and has helped us reduce our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues. However, we also continue to advertise through more traditional media on a limited basis, including newspapers, radio advertisements, other local and regional publications, and on billboards where appropriate. We tailor our marketing strategy and message based on the community being advertised and the customers being targeted.
Financial Services 
In addition to independently branded subsidiary homebuilders, Green Brick Partners retains 100% ownership in Green Brick Title and 49% ownership in BHome Mortgage. Our financial services help our customers bring their homebuying dreams into reality by providing mortgage and title services, allowing for a one-stop-shop solution. Through BHome Mortgage, our mortgage services buyers can expect personal attention from their first meeting through the closing of their new home. As part of the Green Brick Partners family, Green Brick Title’s unprecedented access to resources beyond those of a traditional title company enables us to always stay one step ahead of our competition and bring buyers unmatched customer service.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Raw Materials
Typically, all the raw materials and most of the components used in our business are readily available in the United States. Most are standard items carried by major suppliers. However, the rapid increase in the number of homes started during 2021 through the first half of 2022 caused shortages in the availability of such materials and in the price of services, thereby leading to delays in the delivery of homes and increased home construction prices. We continue to monitor the supply markets to achieve the best prices available. See “Risk Factors - Labor and raw material shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of land development and home construction, which could materially and adversely affect our business.”
Seasonality
The homebuilding industry experiences seasonal fluctuations in quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in spring and summer, although this activity is also highly dependent on the number of active selling communities, timing of new community openings, and other market factors. Since it typically has taken five to nine months to construct a new home, we have historically delivered more homes in the second half of the year as spring and summer home orders are delivered. Because of this seasonality, home starts, construction costs and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the second and third quarters, and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occur during the third and fourth quarters. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry. Due to the significant increase in home demand and the more limited supply of both existing homes and speculative home inventory from all builders for the past two years, such seasonal patterns have been far less evident in our business operations.
Competition
Competition in the homebuilding industry is intense, and there are relatively low barriers to entry. Homebuilders compete for, among other things, homebuyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials, and skilled labor. Increased competition could hurt our business, as it could prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market share expansion, and lead to pricing pressures on our homes that may adversely impact our revenues and margins. Our competitors may independently develop land and construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to our products. Furthermore, a number of our primary competitors are significantly larger, have a longer operating history, and may have greater resources or lower cost of capital; accordingly, they may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which we operate. Many of these competitors also have longstanding relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which we operate. We also compete for sales with individual resales of existing homes and with available rental housing.
Human Capital Resources 
Attracting, retaining, and building talent is critical in our business. We continue to recruit talented team members that exhibit superior emotional intelligence. This focus on a staff that places a strong emphasis on communication and navigating a fast-paced environment empathetically and judiciously enables us to operate effectively and efficiently each day. We seek to establish a supportive culture that fosters a strong sense of ownership and a continuous drive to excel. Our goal is to not just empower our team members with the tools needed to succeed but to create a community that focuses on taking ownership of one’s work. Our culture celebrates individual success, primes our employees for growth, and is critical in maintaining our competitive edge over our peers. 
At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 550 full-time employees, including approximately 500 who were involved in our homebuilding operations, with locations in Dallas-Ft. Worth and Austin, Texas, Atlanta, Georgia and the Treasure Coast, Florida, and approximately 50 in management and administration. Our operations are carried out through both local and centralized management. Our centralized management sets our strategy and leads decisions related to our land acquisition, national purchasing, marketing analytics, risk management, finance, cash management, capital allocation, human resources management, and IT support for our builders. Our homebuilder operations consist of our division employees, led by management with significant homebuilding experience and who possess a depth of knowledge in their particular markets, and include employees responsible for the design, construction oversight, marketing, and sales of our homes. We act solely as a general contractor, and all construction operations are coordinated by our project managers and field superintendents who schedule and monitor third-party independent subcontractors. Our ability to deliver our homes is dependent on the availability and quality of the subcontractors, such as electricians, plumbers, drywall installers, and bricklayers with whom we partner to build our homes. We do not have collective bargaining agreements relating to any of our employees. We offer our employees a compensation package with a broad range of company-paid benefits, including medical, dental, life insurance, and other health and welfare plans, that we believe are competitive. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

We believe having a diverse and inclusive work environment, where everyone has a sense of belonging, not only drives engagement but fosters innovation, which is critical to driving growth. Our management teams are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required internal training on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of discrimination. Furthermore, our management team supports a culture of developing future leaders from our existing workforce, enabling us to promote from within for many leadership positions. We believe this provides long-term focus and continuity to our operations while also providing opportunities for the growth and advancement of our employees.
Governmental Regulations and Environmental Regulation
Homebuilding Related Regulations. We are subject to various local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction, and similar matters, including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements. In addition, local and state governments have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects under their jurisdictions. Governing agencies may also require concessions or may require the developer to commit to providing roads and other offsite infrastructure, the costs of which can be substantial, and may require them to be in place prior to the commencement of new home construction. In addition, governing agencies may impose construction moratoriums which could subject us to delays or may preclude us entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums, “no growth” or “slow growth” initiatives or building permit allocation ordinances, which could be implemented in the future. In addition, we are subject to various licensing, registration, and filing requirements in connection with the construction, advertisement, and sale of homes in our communities. Also, some states are attempting to make homebuilders responsible for violations of wage and other labor laws by their subcontractors.
Environmental Regulations. We are subject to a variety of local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of the environment. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary according to multiple factors, including the site’s location, its environmental conditions, and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties. In some markets, we are subject to environmentally-sensitive land ordinances that mandate open space areas with public elements in housing developments, and prevent development on hillsides, wetlands and other protected areas. We must also comply with open space restrictions, flood plain restrictions, desert wash area restrictions, native plant regulations, endangered species acts, and view restrictions. In those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the restriction or elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. From time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and similar federal or state agencies review homebuilders’ compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to comply strictly with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken may increase our costs. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on homebuilders and land developers in the future. 
Energy and Climate Change Related Regulations. There is constantly a variety of new legislation being enacted, or considered for enactment at the federal, state and local levels relating to energy and climate change. Some of this legislation relates to items such as carbon dioxide emissions control and building codes that impose energy efficiency standards. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase the cost to construct homes, although our energy-efficiency technologies and offerings meet, and in many instances exceed, current and expected energy efficiency thresholds. As climate change concerns continue to grow, legislation and regulations of this nature are expected to continue and may result in increased costs and longer approval and development timelines. Similarly, energy and environment-related initiatives affect a wide variety of companies throughout the United States and the world, and because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel, and concrete, such initiatives could have an indirect adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive carbon dioxide emissions control and other environmental and energy-related regulations.
