Item 1.     Business
Brixmor Property Group Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, “BPG”) is an internally-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”). Brixmor Operating Partnership LP and subsidiaries (collectively, the “Operating Partnership”) is the entity through which BPG conducts substantially all of its operations and owns substantially all of its assets. BPG owns 100% of the common stock of BPG Subsidiary Inc. (“BPG Sub”), which, in turn, is the sole member of Brixmor OP GP LLC (the “General Partner”), the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, “we,” “our” and “us” mean BPG and the Operating Partnership, collectively. We believe we own and operate one of the largest open air retail portfolios by gross leasable area (“GLA”) in the United States (“U.S.“), comprised primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio was comprised of 425 shopping centers (the “Portfolio”) totaling approximately 74 million square feet of GLA. Our high-quality national Portfolio is primarily located within established trade areas in the top 50 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (“MSAs“) in the U.S., and our shopping centers are primarily anchored by non-discretionary and value-oriented retailers, as well as consumer-oriented service providers. As of December 31, 2018, our three largest tenants by annualized base rent (“ABR“) were The TJX Companies, Inc., The Kroger Co., and Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. 
As of December 31, 2018, BPG beneficially owned, through its direct and indirect interest in BPG Sub and the General Partner, 100% of the outstanding partnership common units of interest (the “OP Units”) in the Operating Partnership. The number of OP Units in the Operating Partnership beneficially owned by BPG is equivalent to the number of outstanding shares of BPG’s common stock, and the entitlement of all OP Units to quarterly distributions and payments in liquidation is substantially the same as those of BPG’s common stockholders. BPG’s common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “BRX.” 
Because the Operating Partnership is managed by BPG, and BPG conducts substantially all of its operations through the Operating Partnership, BPG’s executive officers are the Operating Partnership’s executive officers, and although, as a partnership, the Operating Partnership does not have a board of directors, we refer to BPG’s board of directors as the Operating Partnership’s board of directors.

Business Objectives and Strategies
Our primary objective is to maximize total returns to our stockholders through consistent, sustainable growth in cash flow. Our key strategies to achieve this objective include proactively managing our Portfolio to drive internal growth, pursuing value-enhancing reinvestment opportunities and prudently executing on acquisition and disposition 
 1
activity, while also maintaining a flexible capital structure positioned for growth. In addition, as we execute on our key strategies, we do so guided by a commitment to operate in a socially responsible manner that allows us to realize our goal of owning and managing properties that are the center of the communities we serve. 
Driving Internal Growth. Our primary drivers of internal growth include (i) below-market rents which may be reset to market as leases expire, (ii) occupancy growth, and (iii) embedded contractual rent bumps. Strong new leasing productivity enables us to improve the credit of our tenancy and the vibrancy and relevancy of our Portfolio to retailers and consumers. During 2018, we executed 637 new leases representing approximately 3.9 million square feet and 1,979 total leases representing approximately 12.4 million square feet.
We believe that rents across our portfolio are significantly below market, which provides us with a key competitive advantage in attracting and retaining tenants.  During 2018, we achieved new lease rent spreads of 34.4% and blended new and renewal rent spreads of 13.8% excluding options or 11.8% including options. Looking forward, the weighted average expiring ABR PSF of lease expirations through 2022 is $12.75 compared to an average ABR PSF of $15.72 for new and renewal leases signed during 2018, excluding option exercises.  
In addition, we believe there is opportunity for occupancy gains in our Portfolio, especially for spaces less than 10,000 square feet, as such space will benefit from our continued efforts to improve the quality of our anchor tenancy.  For spaces less than 10,000 square feet, leased occupancy was 85.7% at December 31, 2018, while our total leased occupancy was 91.9%.
Over the past three years, we have heightened our focus on achieving higher contractual rent increases over the term of our new and renewal leases, providing for enhanced embedded contractual rent growth across our portfolio. During 2018, our executed new leases reflected an average in-place contractual rent increase over the lease term of 2.0% as compared to 1.7% in 2015.  Additionally, 94% of the executed new leases during 2018 had embedded contractual rent growth provisions, compared with only 78% of the executed new leases during 2015.
Pursuing value-enhancing reinvestment opportunities. We believe that we have significant opportunity to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns by investing incremental capital in the repositioning and/or redevelopment of certain assets in our Portfolio. Such initiatives are tenant driven and focus on upgrading our centers with strong, best-in-class retailers and enhancing the overall merchandise mix and tenant quality of our Portfolio. During 2018, we completed 27 anchor repositioning, redevelopment, outparcel development, and new development projects, with an average incremental net operating income (“NOI”) yield of approximately 9% and an aggregate anticipated cost of approximately $131.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had 60 projects in process at an expected average incremental NOI yield of approximately 9% and an aggregate cost of $352.2 million. In addition, we have identified a pipeline of future redevelopment projects aggregating over $1.0 billion of potential capital investment and over the next several years we expect to accelerate the pace of such investment activity at expected NOI yields that are generally consistent with those which we have recently realized.
Prudently executing on acquisition and disposition activity. We intend to actively pursue acquisition and disposition activity in order to further concentrate our Portfolio in attractive retail submarkets while optimizing the quality and long-term growth rate of our asset base. In general, our disposition strategy focuses on selling assets where we believe value has been maximized, where there is future downside risk, or where we have limited ability or desire to build critical mass in the submarket, while our acquisition strategy focuses on buying assets with strong growth potential that are located in our existing markets and may allow us to more effectively leverage our operational platform and expertise. Acquisition activity may include acquisitions of other open-air shopping centers, non-owned anchor spaces, and retail buildings and/or outparcels at, or adjacent to, our shopping centers in addition to acquisitions of our common stock, pursuant to a $400.0 million share repurchase authorization announced in 2017. 
During 2018, we received aggregate net proceeds of $957.5 million from property dispositions, which were utilized to repay $774.7 million of outstanding indebtedness, to fund our value-enhancing reinvestment program, and to repurchase $104.7 million of our common stock. During 2019, we intend to be more balanced with respect to capital recycling activity, which may include utilizing net disposition proceeds for property acquisitions, in addition to funding reinvestment projects and additional stock repurchases.
Maintaining a Flexible Capital Structure Positioned for Growth. We believe our current capital structure provides us with the financial flexibility and capacity to fund our current capital needs as well as future growth opportunities. 
 2
We have access to multiple forms of capital, including secured property level debt, unsecured corporate level debt, preferred equity, and common equity, which will allow us to efficiently execute on our strategic and operational objectives. We currently have investment grade credit ratings from all three major credit rating agencies. 
During 2018, we made significant enhancements to the duration, pricing and flexibility of our indebtedness through the execution of amendments to our senior unsecured credit facility and term loans, and the repayment of nearly all of our remaining secured indebtedness. As a result, we have no debt maturities until 2021. As of December 31, 2018, our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) had $938.8 million of undrawn capacity including outstanding letters of credit totaling $5.2 million, which reduce available liquidity under our Revolving Facility. 
Operating in a Socially Responsible Manner. We believe that delivering sustainable growth in cash flow also requires us to focus on the environmental, social and economic well-being of the communities we serve, our tenants and our employees. As such, we have established long-term targets relative to mitigating our environmental impact, including specific targets relating to reductions in electric and water usage and greenhouse gas emissions, the development of on-site renewable energy, the conversion to LED lighting and the installation of electric vehicle charging stations. We are also partnering with our tenants to achieve our sustainability goals through our innovative green lease provisions which have facilitated the installation of solar panels, which provide tenants with below-market-rate electricity from these renewable energy systems. As a result of our efforts, we have been recognized by GRESB as a Green Star recipient and by the Institute for Market Transformation and U.S. Department of Energy Better Buildings Alliance as a Green Lease Leader at the highest Gold level. 
Our ongoing commitment to sustainability and the local communities we serve is also evident in our approach to value-enhancing reinvestment, which is focused on transforming properties to meet the needs of communities through strategic remerchandising and redevelopment, executed with a focus on resource efficiency and energy management. Additionally, we work to provide safe and secure environments for our tenants and their customers to connect and engage, both within stores at our centers and in public spaces throughout our Portfolio.  We collaborate with our tenants through ongoing tenant coordination and proactive property management, and we continually monitor our success through the use of tenant engagement surveys. 
We are also highly committed to being a responsible employer and creating and sustaining a positive work environment and corporate culture characterized by high levels of employee engagement, diversity and inclusion. We seek to attract and retain talented and passionate professionals who align with our cultural tenets, which are focused on integrity, accountability and trust. We challenge our employees to act like owners, provide training to help them succeed, and empower them to connect with local communities in order to deliver value to all stakeholders. Through employee engagement surveys we continually monitor our performance and utilize the results to improve our organization.  
Environmental sustainability and social responsibility are important components of our business and operations and we will continue to evaluate our practices and disclosures to emphasize our progress in these key areas. 
Competition
We face considerable competition in the leasing of real estate. We compete with a number of other companies in leasing space to prospective tenants and in renewing current tenants upon expiration of their respective leases. We believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting tenants include the quality of the location and co-tenancy, the relevancy of a center to its community, and the physical conditions and cost of occupancy of our shopping centers. In this regard, we proactively manage and, where and when appropriate, reinvest in and upgrade our shopping centers, with an emphasis on maintaining high occupancy levels with a strong base of nationally and regionally recognized anchor tenants that generate substantial daily traffic. In addition, we believe that the breadth of our national portfolio of shopping centers, the local market knowledge derived from our regional operating teams, and the close relationships we have established with most major national and regional retailers allow us to maintain a strong competitive position. 
Environmental Exposure
We are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulations that apply generally to the ownership of real property and the operations conducted on real property. For further information regarding our risks related to 
 3
environmental exposure see “Environmental conditions that exist at some of the properties in our Portfolio could result in significant unexpected costs” in Item 1A. “Risk Factors”. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 458 employees.
Financial Information about Industry Segments
Our principal business is the ownership and operation of community and neighborhood shopping centers. We do not distinguish our principal business or group our operations on a geographical basis for purposes of measuring performance. Accordingly, we have a single reportable segment for disclosure purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In the opinion of our management, no material part of our and our subsidiaries’ business is dependent upon a single tenant, the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on us, and during 2018 no single tenant or single shopping center accounted for 5% or more of our consolidated revenues. 
REIT Qualification
We have been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the U.S. federal income tax laws, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2011, have maintained such requirements through our taxable year ended December 31, 2018, and intend to satisfy such requirements for subsequent taxable years. So long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on net taxable income that we distribute annually to our stockholders. In order to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the real estate qualification of sources of our income, the composition and value of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the diversity of ownership of our stock. In order to comply with REIT requirements, we may need to forego otherwise attractive opportunities or limit the manner in which we conduct our operations. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax Items.”
