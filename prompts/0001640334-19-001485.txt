Item 1. Business.
Our Plan of Business

Major League Football, Inc. (the “Company“) is seeking to establish, develop and operate Major League Football (“MLFB“) as a professional spring/summer football league. Our official launch occurred with our tryout camps held at four location in March and April of 2019. We are planning a full 6 team, 8 game regular season for 2020 beginning with a full training camp in April 2020 and games in May, June and July 2020. We anticipate holding one championship game following the 2020 regular season. We intend to establish franchises in cities overlooked by existing professional sports leagues and provide fans with professional football in the NFL off-seasons, which will enable us to take a totally non-adversarial approach towards the National Football League (“NFL”). We have commenced the process of leasing playing venues, acquiring football equipment and have obtained required workers compensation insurance for certain states where we will play games. Our spring and early summer schedule ensures no direct competition with autumn/winter football, including the 32 NFL, 9 Canadian Football League, the proposed professional XFL League, 627 NCAA, 91 NAIA, 142 JUCO’s, 27 Canadian Universities, and thousands of high school and collegiate institution teams. 

Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the “Company,” “we,” “our“ or “us“ and other similar terms collectively means Major League Football, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Our principal offices are presently located at 7319 Riviera Cove #7, Lakewood Ranch, Florida, 34202. Our telephone number is (847) 924-4332 and (941) 210-7546. Our Internet website, currently under construction, will be located at: www.mlfb.com.

We expect we will need additional short-term financing as well as financing over the next 12 months and specifically, the Company plans and is in final discussions with individual investors to raise at least an additional $1 million by August 31, 2019 and a tiered subsequent raise of $20 million between October and December 2019. The raise of 20 million dollars will cover the Company’s anticipated expenses for its 6 team 8 game regular season in 2020. Through the issuance date of this report on Form 10-K, smaller investments have been received to meet certain Company expenses and we have completed an agreement to purchase the bulk of the football equipment, helmets, pads, electronics, office equipment and supplies of the bankrupt Alliance of American Football Spring League. This agreement is through the bankruptcy court with NCM Wireless, Inc. for $400,000 that was scheduled on the bankruptcy petition with a valuation in excess of $3,000,000. The agreement between the Company and NCM Wireless, Inc. (“NCM”) is dated July 18, 2019 and the Company funded an initial deposit of $25,000 on July 22, 2019 and the remaining balance of $375,000 is due by July 31, 2019. Additionally, the Company and NCM have agreed to share equally the storage warehouse rent for August 2019 of $10,000. This warehouse currently holds the approximately 32,000 football related items covered by the agreement. 

Single Entity Structure

We intend to operate the league as a single entity owned, stand alone, independent sports league. The single entity structure will be based on the design of Major League Soccer (MLS), where a single entity sports league owns and operates all of its teams. This corporate structure provides several compelling benefits, including:

· | Centralized contracting for ‘players’ services for controlled payrolls without violating antitrust laws
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Greater parity among teams 
· | Focus on the bottom line 
· | Controlled costs 


Management believes that this structure will also promote efficiency by depoliticizing decisions on league policies and allowing decisions to be made with consistency and in a timely fashion. Economies of scale will be achieved through centralizing contract negotiations and handling business affairs in the league office to ensure that individual teams are unified in their decision-making. Further, under this structure, we expect teams will operate in the best interest of the league.

MLFB Market Opportunity

Major League Football intends to establish a brand that is fan-friendly, exciting, affordable and interactive, but most importantly provides consumers real value for their sports dollars. MLFB will underscore the fans’ access to team members, coaches, league officials and other fans. Although Major League Football’s ticket pricing will be a fraction of that of the established professional leagues (NBA, MLB, NHL and NFL), its ultimate goal will be to offer its fans an incomparable value-added experience for their entertainment dollar.

Additionally, as a result of a carefully crafted study, we will not locate teams in any established NFL cities and more importantly in any Major League Baseball cities, thus avoiding direct in-season competition with an established sports entity. By positioning teams in prime emerging and under-represented markets throughout the contiguous 48 states (including placing teams in well respected and football fan friendly metropolitan markets in the country), our research suggests that an exciting sports entity like Major League Football will be viewed in a positive light by sports fans throughout the US. Of equal or greater importance to Major League Football is the fact that both established and peripheral football fans in these exciting new markets will finally be afforded the opportunity of establishing their own personal sports identity while at the same time fostering strong community pride. Lastly, although Major League Football’s long-range vision is to maintain a positive working relationship with the NFL, its ultimate intent is to function as an independent, stand-alone entity that captures sports content needed during off season. Although its economic model was, we believe, flawed, the professional Alliance of American Football teams drew a League wide average attendance of 15,000 fans per game and television ratings comparable to the NBA.

Major League Football intends to disseminate its message using a comprehensive marketing strategy that employs both traditional and new media marketing channels. MLFB’s marketing plans are anticipated to create multiple revenue streams and engage sports fans over a variety of mediums. Specifically, Major League Football intends to develop a far-reaching Internet and mobile strategy that will serve as the backbone of its marketing strategy. This will include developing a mobile initiative, where fans can interact with the league, its players, its coaches, and other fans using their mobile phones all while taking advantage of the player name recognition that comes with fantasy football.

Major League Football also intends to create an interactive website that includes a social networking aspect, podcasts, live video, and more. Along with this new media strategy, cross promotions will also be an important part of the MLFB’s marketing strategy. Major League Football plans to work with businesses involved in video, television, print media and the Internet to promote its business. Much of the necessary preliminary work to meet this new strategy has already been performed by our previously announced external contractors, BDB Entertainment Group, Inc., Reine Digital and Red Moon Marketing. We believe that the cumulative effect of this work will help it achieve its early objectives, which include the following:


· | Establish itself as a recognized professional football league 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Build a base of teams and fans broad enough to sustain business over the critical first five years of operation
· | Generate enough revenue to expand its operations in years three through six 
· | Build successful teams located in regions where there are no existing MLB franchises 
· | Adopt a spring schedule to avoid competing with NFL, collegiate and prep football 
· | Provide year-round cash flow from multi-functioning revenue streams 
· | Build a positive image for the league through year-round community relations campaigns

Professional Sports Market

Major League Football recognizes the NFL is the dominant professional sports league in the United States. Although it clearly respects the success of the NFL business model, Major League Football’s defined objective is to position itself as an independent, non-adversarial football league. Major League Football believes that its own business model encompasses innovations that will be viewed positively by NFL officials, resulting in a strong working relationship between the two leagues. MLB staff have held meetings with high ranking NFL officials to discuss our plans. 

Major League Football will endeavor to maximize ticket vendor technology and enhance its services to patrons with innovative ticketing procedures that include:


· | Average ticket prices targeted at approximately one fourth the prices of NFL, NBA, NHL & MLB tickets 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Year-round cash flow derived from multiple revenue streams utilizing new technologies that didn’t exist as recently as a few years ago A highly developed marketing strategy that uses both traditional and new media to attract existing football fans as well as an entirely untapped market of potential new fans
· | A more interactive, informative website in professional sports using cutting edge technologies that help preserve fan loyalty 
· | Proven executive staff members with considerable practical experience in professional football 
· | Player and coaching costs projected at 65-80% less than those of the NFL, NBA, NHL or MLB 


Initially, Major League Football teams will operate in either existing collegiate or municipal stadiums during the spring and early summer season. 

We believe that our business model and long-range vision possess many innovations that will be viewed in a positive light by NFL owners and league officials and will also lend itself to the potential of establishing a strong working relationship with our venture by positioning ourselves in a 100% non-adversarial position to the established NFL.

Audience

Major League Football believes that today’s market demands a controlled deliverable to a targeted demographic viewing audience as well as controlled advertising deliverables to specific targeted demographic audiences as well. Other sports attract audiences that are only a fraction of that number, in producing the sponsor and advertiser concerns. Therefore, retaining the mass appeal needed to attract such an audience is an over-arching consideration that shapes much of what we do and what concerns the Company.
Merchandising & Licensing Overview

The thrust of our licensing and co-branding strategy is to create an increase in brand value for MLFB and the partners we align with. In order for the league to have a robust licensing and co-branding business, we have created a 3-tier approach that focuses on generating strong revenue streams for the league and initiating value based collaborative efforts that further enhance the MLFB brand.

The main benefits of the program are:


· | Fans will find quality items at more favorable price points. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Teams will gain more profit on each item and stop tying up money on inventory they cannot’ properly sell. 
· | More fans will be wearing and supporting the team and league branded merchandise, which is the number one way to brand outside the stadium

We also intend to develop private label products where we will feature products that are core fan favorites (hats, shirts, popular novelties and gifts, etc.) all manufactured at the highest level, and priced far below traditional licensed sports merchandise programs. All merchandise, when league sanctioned, will be pre- ticketed and priced.
