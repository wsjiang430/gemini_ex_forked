ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
 
Argan, Inc. (Argan) conducts operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Gemma Power Systems, LLC and affiliates (GPS), Atlantic Projects Company Limited and affiliates (APC), The Roberts Company, Inc. (TRC) and Southern Maryland Cable, Inc. (SMC) (together referred to as the Company, we, us, or our). Through GPS and APC, we provide a full range of engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, operations management, maintenance, project development, technical and consulting services to the power generation and renewable energy markets. The wide range of customers includes independent power producers, public utilities, power plant equipment suppliers and global energy plant construction firms. Including its consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities (VIEs), GPS and APC represent the Companys power industry services reportable segment. Through TRC, the industrial fabrication and field services reportable segment provides on-site services that support maintenance turnarounds, shutdowns and emergency mobilizations for industrial plants primarily located in the southern United States (the US) and that are based on its expertise in producing, delivering and installing fabricated steel components such as piping systems, pressure vessels and heat exchangers. Through SMC, which conducts business as SMC Infrastructure Solutions, the telecommunications infrastructure services segment provides project management, construction, installation and maintenance services to commercial, local government and federal government customers primarily in the mid-Atlantic region of the US.
 
Holding Company Structure
 
Argan was organized as a Delaware corporation in May 1961. We intend to make additional opportunistic acquisitions and/or investments by identifying companies with significant potential for profitable growth. We may have more than one industrial focus. We expect that companies acquired in each of these industrial groups will be held in separate subsidiaries that will be operated in a manner that best provides cash flows for the Company and value for our stockholders. Argan is a holding company with no operations other than its continuing investments in GPS, APC, TRC and SMC.
Power Industry Services
 
Our power industry services are performed substantially by GPS which is a full-service engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services firm that we have operated for over twelve years since it was acquired by us in 2006. GPS has the proven abilities of designing, building and commissioning large-scale energy projects in the US. The extensive design, construction, project management, start-up and operating experience of GPS has grown with installed and under-contract capacity for nearly 15 gigawatts of mostly domestic power-generating capacity including 65 gas turbines comprising 44 projects. Our power projects have included base-load combined-cycle facilities, simple-cycle peaking plants and boiler plant construction and renovation efforts. We also have experience in the renewable energy sector by providing EPC contracting and other services to the owners of alternative energy facilities, including biomass plants, wind farms and solar fields. Typically, the scope of work for GPS includes complete plant engineering and design, the procurement of equipment and construction from site development through electrical interconnection and plant testing. The durations of our construction projects may extend to three years. In the most recent construction firm rankings published in May 2018 by Engineering News-Record (ENR), GPS was ranked the 9th largest power industry construction contractor in the US.
 
This reportable business segment also includes APC, a company formed in Dublin, Ireland, over 40 years ago, and its affiliated companies, which we acquired in May 2015. APC provides turbine, boiler and large rotating equipment installation, commissioning and outage services to original equipment manufacturers, global construction firms and plant owners worldwide. APC has successfully completed projects in more than 30 countries on six continents. With its presence in Ireland and its other offices located in the United Kingdom (the UK), Hong Kong and New York, APC expanded our operations internationally for the first time.
 
The revenues of our power industry services business segment were $367.8 million, $814.5 million and $586.6 million for the years ended January 31, 2019 (Fiscal 2019), 2018 (Fiscal 2018) and 2017 (Fiscal 2017), respectively, or 76%, 91% and 87% of our consolidated revenues for the corresponding periods, respectively. The substantial portions of the revenues of this reportable segment reported for all three of these years were derived from the performance of activities by GPS and APC under EPC services contracts with the owners of power plant projects.

During Fiscal 2019, we reached substantial completion for four natural gas-fired power plant EPC services projects, including a 1040 MW facility built in Pennsylvania, a 785 MW facility built in Connecticut and two 475 MW facilities, one built in Ohio and the other in North Carolina. Projects active at January 31, 2019 included the provision of EPC services to two other natural gas-fired power plant projects and the erection of the boiler, a critical component, for a biomass-fired power plant.
 
The following table summarizes our large power plant projects as of January 31, 2019:
 

 | | Facility | FNTP (1) | Scheduled 
-------------------------------------------+--------------------+----------+---------------+-----------
Current Project | Location | Size | Received | Completion
Exelon West Medway II Facility | Massachusetts | 200 MW | April 2017 | (2) 
TeesREP Biomass Power Station | Teesside (England) | 299 MW | May 2017 | 2019 
InterGen Spalding OCGT Expansion Project | Spalding (England) | 298 MW | November 2017 | 2019 
NTE Reidsville Energy Center | North Carolina | 475 MW | (3) | (3) 
Guernsey Power Station | Ohio | 1,875 MW | (4) | 2022 

 
(1)         Full Notice-to-Proceed (FNTP) represents the formal notice provided by the customer instructing us to commence all of the activities covered by the corresponding contract.
 (2)         Project activities were discontinued on March 7, 2019. At that time, the EPC project was nearly complete and first fire had been achieved on both of the power production units included in this gas-fired power plant (see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, included in Part I of this report for further information regarding this matter).
 (3)         A FNTP has not been received and the scheduled completion date has not been established definitively as of January 31, 2019.
 (4)         A limited notice to proceed with certain preliminary design and site preparation activities was issued to GPS in January 2019. We expect to receive FNTP in the spring of 2019.
 
During Fiscal 2018, we were engaged with ramping-up the construction efforts on the four major power plant EPC projects to peak activity levels. In addition, we commenced the provision of EPC services on the two other gas-fired facilities and construction tasks related to the biomass power plant project. During Fiscal 2017, we completed two natural gas-fired combined cycled power plant projects and began activities on four other major gas-fired power plant projects. Both completed plants are located in Pennsylvania with each one providing 829 MW of electrical power.
 
Project Backlog
 
Our reported amount of project backlog at a point in time represents the total value of projects awarded to us that we consider to be firm as of that date less the amounts of revenues recognized to date on the corresponding projects. Cancellations or reductions may occur that would reduce project backlog and our expected future revenues. Typically, we include the total value of EPC services and other major construction contracts in project backlog when we receive a corresponding notice to proceed from the project owner. However, we may include the value of an EPC services contract prior to the receipt of a notice to proceed if we believe that it is probable that the project will commence within a reasonable timeframe, among other factors. At January 31, 2019, the project backlog for this reporting segment was approximately $1.1 billion. The comparable backlog amount as of January 31, 2018 was approximately $0.4 billion.
 
In January 2019, we entered into an EPC services contract with and received a limited notice to proceed from Guernsey Power Station, LLC to construct an 1,875 MW state-of-the-art natural gas-fired power plant in Guernsey County, Ohio. Construction for the facility is scheduled to begin in the spring with completion scheduled in 2022. The developers of this power plant project are Apex Power Group, LLC and Caithness Energy, L.L.C. (Caithness), both of which are independent power producers specializing in the development, acquisition, operation and management of natural gas and renewable energy projects. Caithness is the owner of the Caithness Moxie Freedom Generating Station, the gas-fired power plant substantially completed by us in Pennsylvania during Fiscal 2019.
 
On March 27, 2018, we announced that GPS entered into an EPC services contract with NTE Carolinas II, LLC, an affiliate of NTE Energy (NTE), to construct a 475 MW natural gas-fired power plant in Rockingham County, North Carolina. NTE, through its affiliates, develops and acquires strategically located electric generation and transmission facilities within North America. The NTE Reidsville Energy Center is planned to be similar to two gas-fired power plants substantially completed by GPS for NTE during Fiscal 2019, the Kings Mountain Energy Center located in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, and the Middletown Energy Center located in Middletown, Ohio. Due to project owner delays, contract activities have not yet started for this new project.

As most construction activities are performed outdoors and significant projects of this reportable segment are located in the northeastern region of the US, the UK and Ireland, progress on projects may be adversely impacted, from time to time, by inclement weather particularly during the winter months. On the other hand, unseasonably fair weather may enhance our ability to complete project work.
 
Construction Joint Ventures
 
EPC contractors in our industry periodically execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited liability companies for the purpose of completing a project or program for a project owner. These special purpose entities are generally dissolved upon completion of the corresponding project or program. Accordingly, GPS assigned its EPC contracts for two natural gas-fired power plants to two separate joint ventures that were formed in order to build the power plants and to spread the bonding risk of each project. The power plants were substantially completed during Fiscal 2017. Both joint ventures were dissolved in October 2018 and final cash distributions in the total amount of approximately $0.3 million were made to the venture partners during Fiscal 2019. Due to the financial control of GPS, the accounts of the joint ventures were included in the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Project Development Participation
 
We selectively participate in developmental and related financing activities 1) to maintain a proprietary pipeline for future EPC services contract opportunities, 2) to secure exclusive rights to EPC contracts, and 3) to generate profits through interest income and project development success fees. We partnered with a developer to take principal positions in the initial stages of development for three projects in the Marcellus Shale Region of the eastern US. All three developmental efforts were successfully completed resulting in GPS securing the rights for EPC contracts pursuant to which GPS completed construction of the corresponding large-scale natural gas-fired power plants and we were paid success fees. Currently, we are participating in developmental and related financing activities with several developers, including the consolidated variable interest entity created to develop the Chickahominy Power Station which is planned to be built in Charles City County, Virginia. In June 2018, we announced that GPS has been awarded the EPC services contract for this 1,600 MW gas-fired power plant. Among other tasks, the efforts of the developer to obtain final regulatory permits and approvals and to secure financing for this power plant, which are essential for the completion of the development phase of this project, are currently underway.
Materials and Labor
 
In connection with the engineering and construction of traditional power plants, biodiesel plants and other renewable energy systems, we procure materials for installation on the various projects. We are not dependent upon any one source for major equipment components, like heat recovery steam generation units, steam turbines and air-cooled condensers, or any other construction materials that we use to complete a particular power project. With our assistance, project owners frequently procure and supply certain major components of the power plants such as heavy-duty and combustion gas turbines. We have significant experience in delivering EPC projects with the latest turbine technology from all three major manufacturers. We are not currently experiencing difficulties in procuring or scheduling the necessary materials for our contracted projects. However, we cannot guarantee that in the future there will not be unscheduled delays in the delivery of materials and equipment ordered by us or a project owner.
 
We perform work on job sites in different states and countries. The skilled craft labor pool is unique in each region due to a variety of factors, including union versus non-union work environments, competing infrastructure projects located nearby our sites that utilize the same labor pool as us, and decreased and aging labor pools resulting from demographic trends. As such, we take a carefully considered and tailored approach at each job site to acquire and retain the required personnel resources when we need them, especially craft labor, and to maintain optimum productivity on each of our projects. Depending on the project, we may utilize direct hires, subcontractors, existing internal personnel, or a combination of the three. To date, we have managed to staff each of our jobs safely and effectively. However, given the reported labor shortages in the construction industry, rising wages, demographic trends and other challenges, we cannot guarantee that in the future we will be able to hire the skilled craft labor needed to complete each of our projects successfully.

Competition
 
We compete with numerous large and well capitalized private and public firms in the construction and engineering services industry. However, the competitive landscape in the EPC services market for natural gas-fired power plant construction has changed significantly this year. Several major competitors have announced that they are exiting the market for a variety of reasons. While the market remains dynamic, we expect that there will be fewer competitors for new gas-fired power plant EPC services project opportunities. These remaining competitors include, but are not limited to, Bechtel Corporation, McDermott International and Black & Veatch, global firms providing engineering, procurement, construction and project management services; and Kiewit Corporation, an employee-owned global construction firm. These and other competitors are multi-billion-dollar companies with thousands of employees. We also may compete with regional construction services companies in the markets where planned projects might be located. Typically, a condition for award is that the contractor perform on a fixed-price or lump-sum contract basis; smaller elements of a contract may be billable on an allowance or cost-reimbursable basis. As explained below, there are risks of unrecovered costs, among other features, associated with these types of contracts.
 
To compete with these firms, we emphasize our proven track record as a cost-effective choice for the design, build and commissioning of natural gas-fired and alternative energy power systems. Our successful experience includes the efficient completion of natural gas-fired simple cycle and combined cycle power plants, wood/coal-fired plants, waste-to-energy plants, wind farms, solar fields and biofuel processing facilities, all performed on an EPC contract basis. Through the power industry services segment, we provide a full range of competitively priced development, consulting, engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, operations management and maintenance services to project owners. We are able to react quickly to their requirements while bringing a strong, experienced team to help navigate through difficult technical, scheduling and construction issues. We believe that the cultures of GPS and APC encourage motivated, creative, high energy and customer-focused teams that deliver results. Our projects are directed by dedicated on-site project management teams and our project owner customers have direct access to our senior management at these companies.
 
Customers
 
For Fiscal 2019, the Companys most significant power industry services customers were Exelon West Medway II; Moxie Freedom LLC; Tecnicas Reunidas UK Limited and NTE Carolinas LLC, each of which accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues and which together represented 51% of consolidated revenues for the year.
 
For Fiscal 2018, the Companys most significant power industry services customers accounting for more than 10% of consolidated revenues were NTE Ohio LLC; CPV Towantic, LLC; Moxie Freedom LLC and NTE Carolinas LLC. Together, these customers represented 84% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018.
 
For Fiscal 2017, the Companys significant power industry services customers were NTE Ohio LLC; CPV Towantic, LLC; Moxie Freedom LLC; NTE Carolinas LLC and Panda Patriot LLC, each of which accounted for greater than 10% of consolidated revenues and which together represented 79% of consolidated revenues for the year.
 
Regulation
 
Our power industry services operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations including: licensing for contractors; building codes; permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects; regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection; and special bidding, procurement and employee compensation requirements. Many state and local regulations governing construction require permits and licenses to be held by individuals who have passed an examination or met other requirements. We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our current operations and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
 
The power plants that we build, and other energy facilities including the pipelines required to supply natural gas fuel to them, are also subject to a myriad of federal and state laws and regulations governing environmental protection, air quality, water quality and noise and height restrictions. The growing preference for renewable energy sources and the elimination of fossil-fueled power plants by the populations of the US and the UK may result in such restrictions becoming more severe in the future. The consequences may result in fewer gas-fired power plants being constructed in the future than are currently forecasted.

Industrial Fabrication and Field Services
 
On December 4, 2015, we acquired TRC, which was founded in 1977 and is located near Greenville, North Carolina. Its facilities include steel fabrication plants and support structures. TRC is principally an industrial field services provider and steel pipe and vessel fabricator for industrial organizations primarily in the southern region of the US. TRC continues to operate under its own name with its own management team.
 
Historically, TRC was a profitable company that incurred a net loss in 2015 up to the date of its acquisition by us, primarily due to it taking on large contracts that resulted in significant losses. With the reengagement and leadership of TRCs founder, our financial support and the substantial completion of these loss contracts, we acquired TRC with the belief that it was positioned to succeed in the future with a return to profitable operations. Significant efforts have been expended since the acquisition to sustain a turnaround of operating results which reflected growing revenues and profitable operating results for Fiscal 2019. However, there can be no assurances that TRC will sustain the current positive trend in revenues or improve profitability in the future. Since the acquisition, we have provided TRC with an additional $27.5 million in cash so that it could fund the completion of the work on loss contracts in progress on the date of the acquisition, enhance working capital in support of business growth and stability, acquire capital equipment to assure efficient and competitive fabrication and field operations and support other general corporate needs. Most of this cash was provided in the year period following the acquisition.
 
Currently, TRC operates as its own reportable business segment, industrial field services and fabrication. Its major customers include North Americas largest forest products companies such as Weyerhaeuser Company and Domtar Corporation; power companies such as Duke Energy Corporation; energy companies such as Husky Energy Inc.; large fertilizer companies such as Nutrien Ltd. (formerly Potash Corp.); EPC firms such as Fluor Corporation; mining companies such as OceanaGold Corporation; a world leading supplier of industrial gases, Air Liquide S.A., and various petrochemical companies. For Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, this reporting segment reported revenues of $101.7 million, $65.3 million and $79.0 million, respectively, or approximately 21%, 7% and 12% of our consolidated revenues for the corresponding years, respectively.
 
Telecommunications Infrastructure Services
 
SMC represents our telecommunications infrastructure services reportable business segment and conducts business as SMC Infrastructure Solutions, which provides comprehensive technology wiring and utility construction solutions to customers primarily in the mid-Atlantic region of the US. We perform both outside plant and inside plant cabling.
 
Services provided to our outside premises customers include trenchless directional boring and excavation for underground communication and power networks, aerial cabling services, and the installation of buried cable, high and low voltage electric lines, and private area outdoor lighting systems. The outside premises services are primarily provided to state and local government agencies, regional communications service providers, electric utilities and other commercial customers. The wide range of inside premises wiring services that we provide to our customers include the structuring, cabling, terminations and connectivity that provide the physical transport for high speed data, voice, video and security networks. These services are provided primarily to federal government facilities, including cleared facilities, on a direct and subcontract basis. Such facilities typically require regular upgrades to their wiring systems in order to accommodate improvements in security, telecommunications and network capabilities.
 
Consistently, a major portion of SMCs revenue-producing activity each year is performed pursuant to task or work orders issued under master agreements with SMCs major customers. Over the last three years, these major customers have included the city of Westminster, Maryland; the Maryland Transit Administration and other state agencies, counties and municipalities located in Maryland; DXC Technology Company, formed by the combination of Computer Sciences Corporation and the enterprise services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise; and Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative, a local electricity cooperative. The revenues of SMC were $12.7 million, $13.0 million and $9.4 million for Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively, or approximately 3%, 1% and 1% of our consolidated revenues for the corresponding years, respectively.
 
SMC operates in the fragmented and competitive telecommunication and infrastructure services industry. We compete with providers ranging from regional companies to larger firms servicing multiple regions, as well as large national and multi-national contractors. We believe that we compete favorably with the other companies in our market space by emphasizing our high-quality reputation, outstanding customer base, security-cleared personnel and highly motivated work force in competing for larger and more diverse contracts. Based on its reputation and quality performance, SMC was selected on a sole source basis to perform outside premises and structured cabling work at a secure overseas location which it completed successfully during Fiscal 2019. SMC expects to receive similar assignments at other overseas locations.

Employees
 
The total number of personnel employed by us is subject to the volume of construction in progress and the relative amount of work performed by subcontractors. We had approximately 1,487 employees at January 31, 2019, substantially all of whom were full-time. We believe that our employee relations are generally good.
Financing Arrangements
 
We have financing arrangements with Bank of America (the Bank) that are described in an Amended Replacement Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), dated May 15, 2017, which superseded our prior arrangements with the Bank. The Credit Agreement provides a revolving loan with a maximum borrowing amount of $50.0 million that is available until May 31, 2021 with interest at the 30-day LIBOR plus 2.0%. We may also use the borrowing ability to cover other credit instruments issued by the Bank for our use in the ordinary course of business. At January 31, 2019, the Company had credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement, but no borrowings, in the approximate amount of $15.2 million. We have pledged the majority of our assets to secure the financing arrangements. The Banks consent is not required for acquisitions, divestitures, cash dividends or significant investments as long as certain conditions are met. The Bank requires that we comply with certain financial covenants at our fiscal year-end and at each of our fiscal quarter-ends. The Credit Agreement includes other terms, covenants and events of default that are customary for a credit facility of its size and nature. As of January 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement. We believe we will continue to comply with our financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.
Safety, Risk Management, Insurance and Performance Bonds
 
We are committed to ensuring that the employees of each of our businesses perform their work in a safe environment. We regularly communicate with our employees to promote safety and to instill safe work habits. GPS, APC, TRC and SMC each have an experienced full-time safety director committed to ensuring a safe work place, as well as compliance with applicable permits, insurance and local and environmental laws.
 
Contracts with customers in each of our reportable business segments may require performance bonds or other means of financial assurance to secure contractual performance. Under such circumstances and/or as a means to spread project risk, we may consider an arrangement with a joint venture party in order to provide the required bonding to a prospective project owner (see Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). We maintain material amounts of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on our balance sheet, and, as indicated above, we have the commitment of the Bank to issue irrevocable standby letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $50.0 million in support of our bonding collateral requirements. As of January 31, 2019, the amount of unsatisfied bonded performance obligations related to GPS was not significant. However, as of January 31, 2019, there were bonds outstanding in the aggregate amount of approximately $147.0 million covering other risks including our warranty obligations related to four EPC services projects completed by GPS during Fiscal 2019. Not all of our projects require bonding.
