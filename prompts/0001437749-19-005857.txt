Item 1.  Business
General
 
We were formed as a Delaware corporation in 1997. We are a diversified provider of truck components, oil and gas pipeline components and aerospace and defense electronics. We produce a wide range of manufactured products, often under multi-year, sole-source contracts.
 
We are organized into two business segments, Sypris Technologies and Sypris Electronics. Sypris Technologies, which is comprised of Sypris Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries, generates revenue primarily from the sale of forged, machined, welded and heat-treated steel components primarily for the heavy commercial vehicle and high-pressure energy pipeline applications. Sypris Electronics, which is comprised of Sypris Electronics, LLC, is focused on circuit card and full “box build” manufacturing, high reliability manufacturing, systems assembly and integration, design for manufacturability and design to specification work.
 
We focus on those markets where we believe we have the expertise, qualifications and leadership position to sustain a competitive advantage. We target our resources to support the needs of industry participants that embrace multi-year contractual relationships as a strategic component of their supply chain management. These contracts, many of which are sole-source by part number, historically have created opportunities to invest in leading-edge processes or technologies to help our customers remain competitive. The productivity and innovation that can result from such investments helps to differentiate us from our competition when it comes to cost, quality, reliability and customer service.
 
Our manufacturing processes frequently involve the fabrication or assembly of a product or subassembly according to specifications provided by our customers. We strive to enhance our manufacturing capabilities by advanced quality and manufacturing techniques, lean manufacturing, just-in-time procurement and continuous flow manufacturing, six sigma, total quality management, stringent and real-time engineering change control routines and total cycle time reduction techniques. At the same time, we are working to develop new designs and product innovations by re-engineering traditional solutions to eliminate cost without reducing durability or quality.
 
Sypris Technologies. Through Sypris Technologies, we are a significant supplier of forged and machined components, serving the commercial vehicle, off highway vehicle, light truck, automotive and energy markets in North America. We have the capacity to produce drive train components including axle shafts, transmission shafts, gear sets, steer axle knuckles, and other components for ultimate use by the leading automotive and truck manufacturers, including FCA US (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles), General Motors Company (GM), Nissan Motor Corporation (Nissan), Freightliner LLC (Freightliner), Mack Truck (Mack), Navistar International Corporation (Navistar), PACCAR, Inc. (PACCAR) and Volvo Truck Corporation (Volvo). We support our customers’ strategies to outsource non-core operations by supplying additional components and providing additional value added operations for drive train assemblies. We also manufacture high-pressure closures and other fabricated products for oil and gas pipelines.
 
Our manufacturing contracts for the truck components and assemblies markets are often sole-source by part number. Part numbers may be specified for inclusion in a single model or a range of models. Where we are the sole-source provider by part number, we are generally the exclusive provider to our customer of those specific parts for the duration of the manufacturing contract.
 
Sypris Technologies also manufactures energy-related products such as pressurized closures, insulated joints and other specialty products, primarily for oil and gas pipelines and related energy markets. This product line is an important source of diversified revenues and is becoming an area of greater focus for the Company going forward. We are committed to exploring new product developments and potential new markets, which will also be an increasing area of focus for the Company going forward.

The Company has reduced its reliance on certain of its traditional Tier 1 customers that represent the primary suppliers to the original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) in the commercial vehicle markets, while targeting to replace these customers with longer-term, more diversified relationships, especially among the OEMs and others who place a higher value on the Company’s innovation, flexibility and core commitment to lean manufacturing principles. Among the customer programs not being renewed was a supply agreement with Meritor Inc. (“Meritor”), which expired on January 1, 2017, which utilized production at the Company’s Louisville, Kentucky automotive and commercial vehicle manufacturing plant (the “Broadway Plant”). The Company has also not renewed its business with Eaton Corporation (“Eaton”). As a result of these decisions, the Company experienced a significant reduction in its commercial vehicle revenues in 2017. This change in strategy culminated with the Company’s decision to exit the Broadway Plant, one of our largest commercial vehicle component manufacturing facilities, and to consolidate certain assets from the Broadway Plant into other manufacturing facilities, as needed, to serve and grow our customer base.
 
On February 21, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a modified exit or disposal plan with respect to the Broadway Plant, which was substantially complete as of the end of 2017. The Company has relocated certain assets from the Broadway Plant to other manufacturing facilities as needed to serve its existing and targeted customer base and identified underutilized or non-core assets for disposal. Management expects to use the proceeds from the sale of any underutilized or non-core assets to help fund costs of transferring any additional equipment from the Broadway Plant. Management is continuing to explore various options for the real estate and any remaining assets in the Broadway Plant.
 
Sypris Technologies has adjusted its overhead and infrastructure to be more in line with lower projected levels of customer demand and market requirements. We are working to rebuild Sypris Technologies’ revenues in an effort to become profitable again. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. There can be no assurances that such conditions will continue or that our efforts to cut costs and rebuild our revenues through new customers will be successful.
 
Sypris Technologies represented approximately 68% of our net revenues in 2018.
 
Sypris Electronics. Sypris Electronics generates revenue primarily through circuit card and full box build manufacturing, high reliability manufacturing, systems assembly and integration, design for manufacturability and design to specification, for customers in the aerospace and defense electronics markets. This includes circuit card assemblies for electronic sensors and systems including radar and targeting systems, tactical ground stations, navigation systems, weapons systems, targeting and warning systems and those used in the nation’s high priority space programs.
 
We provide our customers with a broad variety of value added solutions, from low-volume prototype assembly to high-volume turnkey manufacturing. Our manufacturing contracts for the aerospace and defense electronics market are generally sole-source by part number. Our customers include large aerospace and defense companies such as Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed Martin), Northrop Grumman Corporation (Northrop Grumman), Harris Corporation (Harris) and Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI).
 
The engineering and manufacturing of highly complex components for the aerospace and defense industries is a fairly fragmented industry with no dominant player in the market. The industry has continued to grow with more companies developing printed circuit board assembly capabilities and others entering the market via mergers and acquisitions of smaller companies. This has led to increased competition from larger companies that have significant financial resources. This competitive business environment, along with the impact of federal government spending uncertainties in the U.S. and the allocation of funds by the U.S. Department of Defense has challenged Sypris Electronics over the past several years.
 
We announced new program awards for Sypris Electronics that contributed to revenue in 2017 and 2018, with certain programs continuing into 2019. In addition to program awards related to weapons systems, electronic warfare and infrared countermeasures in our traditional aerospace and defense markets, we have also been awarded programs related to the communication and navigation markets which align with our capabilities for delivering products for complex, high cost of failure platforms. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 provides nearly $700 billion in funding for the U.S. Department of Defense, which is expected to support program growth and market expansion during the coming year for aerospace and defense participants. We expect that our reduction in overhead following our relocation to a new manufacturing facility in 2017 will allow us to compete favorably for follow-on business opportunities on future builds of these programs.

In the near term, certain electronic component shortages and extensive lead-time issues are becoming prevalent in many of the segments in the electronic manufacturing industry that we serve. These shortages and extended lead times are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. We are working with our customers to qualify alternative components or suppliers to mitigate the impact on our business. The majority of our aerospace and defense programs require specific components that are sole-sourced from specific suppliers; therefore, the resolution of supplier constraints requires coordination with our customers or the end-users of the products.
 
Sypris Electronics accounted for approximately 32% of net revenue in 2018.
 
Our Markets
 
Sypris Technologies. The industrial manufacturing markets include automotive, truck and off-highway components and assemblies and specialty closures. The automotive and truck components and assemblies market consists of the original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, including FCA, Freightliner, GM, Mack, Navistar, PACCAR and Volvo, and an extensive supply chain of companies of all types and sizes that are classified into different levels or tiers. Tier 1 companies represent the primary suppliers to the OEMs and include Meritor, Dana Inc. (Dana), Detroit Diesel Corporation (Detroit Diesel), American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc. (America Axle) and Eaton, among others. Below this group of companies reside numerous suppliers that either supply the OEMs directly or supply the Tier I companies. In all segments of the truck components and assemblies, however, suppliers are under intense competitive pressure to improve product quality and to reduce capital expenditures, production costs and inventory levels. As noted above, the Company has determined to migrate away from certain of its traditional Tier 1 customers in the commercial vehicle markets, while seeking to replace these customers with mutually beneficial relationships, especially among the heavy truck, off-highway and automotive OEMs and others who place a higher value on the Company’s innovation, flexibility and core commitment to lean manufacturing principles. The customers for our specialty closure products consists primarily of operators and builders of oil and gas pipelines, which are also facing significant pressures to improve quality, reduce costs and defer capital expenditures.
Sypris Electronics Although we believe that our programs are well aligned with national defense and other priorities, shifts in domestic and international spending and tax policy, changes in security, defense and intelligence priorities, the affordability of our products, changes in or preferences for new or different technologies, general economic conditions and other factors may affect the level of funding for existing or proposed programs.
 
Market conditions for our electronic manufacturing business are characterized by a number of obstacles. The nature of providing manufactured products to the aerospace and defense electronics industry as well as other regulated markets differs substantially from the commercial electronics manufacturing industry. The cost of failure can be extremely high, the manufacturing requirements are typically complex and products are produced in relatively small quantities. Companies within this industry are required to maintain and adhere to a number of strict and comprehensive certifications, security clearances and traceability standards.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
Our objective is to improve our position in each of our core markets by increasing our number of multi-year relationships with customers and investing in highly innovative and efficient production capacity to remain competitive on a global scale. We intend to serve our customers and achieve this objective by continuing to:
 
Concentrate on our Core Markets. We are a significant supplier of forged, machined, welded and heat-treated components and subassemblies, serving the commercial vehicle, off highway vehicle, light truck and energy markets in North America. We have been an established supplier to major aerospace and defense companies and agencies of the U.S. Government for over 40 years. We will continue to focus on those markets where we have the expertise, capacity and qualifications to achieve a competitive advantage.
 
Dedicate our Resources to Support Strategic Partnerships. We will continue to prioritize our resources to support the needs of industry leaders that embrace multi-year contractual relationships as a strategic component of their supply chain management and have the potential for long-term growth. We prefer contracts that are sole-source by part number so we can work closely with the customer to the mutual benefit of both parties.
Pursue the Strategic Acquisition of Assets. Over the long-term, we may consider the strategic acquisition of assets to consolidate our position in our core markets, expand our presence outside the U.S., create or strengthen our relationships with leading companies and expand our range of products in return for multi-year supply agreements. We will consider assets that can be integrated with our core businesses and that can be used to support other customers, thereby improving asset utilization and achieving greater productivity, flexibility and economies of scale.

Grow Through the Addition of New Value-Added Manufacturing Capabilities. We hope to grow through the addition of new value-added manufacturing capabilities and the introduction of additional components in the supply chain that enable us to provide a more complete solution by improving quality and reducing product cost, inventory levels and cycle times for our customers. In many instances, we offer a variety of state-of-the-art machining capabilities to our customers in the industrial manufacturing markets that enable us to reduce labor and shipping costs and minimize cycle times for our customers over the long-term, which we believe will provide us with additional growth opportunities in the future.
 
We believe that the number and duration of our strategic relationships should grow to enable us to invest in our business with greater certainty and with less risk. The investments we make in support of these relationships are targeted to provide us with the productivity, flexibility, technological edge and economies of scale that we believe will help to differentiate us from the competition in the future when it comes to cost, quality, reliability and customer service.
 
Our Customers
 
Our five largest customers in 2018 were Sistemas Automotrices de Mexico, S.A de C.V. (Sistemas), Northrop Grumman, Detroit Diesel, Harris and Jamison Products (Jamison), which in the aggregate accounted for 61% of net revenue. Our five largest customers in 2017 were Detroit Diesel, Northrop Grumman, Sistemas, Tyco Electronics Subsea Communications LLC (Tyco) and Harris, which in the aggregate accounted for 52% of net revenue. In 2018, Sistemas, Northrup Grumman and Detroit Diesel represented approximately 19%, 14% and 14% of our net revenue, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue in 2018. In 2017, Detroit Diesel, Northrup Grumman and Sistemas represented approximately 14%, 13% and 13% of our net revenue, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue in 2017.
Geographic Areas and Currency Fluctuations
 
Our operations are located in the U.S. and Mexico. Our Mexican subsidiaries and affiliates are a part of Sypris Technologies and manufacture and sell a number of products similar to those Sypris Technologies produces or previously produced in the U.S. In addition to normal business risks, operations outside the U.S. may be subject to a greater risk of changing political, economic and social environments, changing governmental laws and regulations, currency revaluations and market fluctuations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have primarily impacted our earnings only to the extent of remeasurement gains or losses related to U.S. dollar denominated accounts of our foreign subsidiaries, because the vast majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, “other income, net” included foreign currency translation gains of less than $0.1 million and losses of $0.8 million, respectively.
 
Net revenues from Mexican operations were $39.7 million, or 45%, and $22.9 million, or 28%, of our consolidated net revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2018, net income from our Mexican operations was $1.6 million, as compared to our consolidated net loss of $3.5 million. In 2017, net loss from our Mexican operations was $4.3 million, as compared to our consolidated net loss of $10.8 million. Revenues from our Mexican operations have grown significantly as a percentage of our consolidated net revenues, especially in connection with the shutdown of the Broadway Plant, which occurred at the end of 2017. You can find more information about our regional operating results, including our export sales, in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Sales and Business Development
 
Our principal sources of new business originate from the expansion of existing relationships, referrals and direct sales through senior management, direct sales personnel, domestic and international sales representatives, distributors and market specialists. We supplement these selling efforts with a variety of sales literature, advertising in trade media and participating in trade shows. We also utilize engineering specialists to facilitate the sales process by working with potential customers to reduce the cost of the products they need. Our specialists achieve this objective by working with the customer to improve their product’s design for ease of manufacturing or by reducing the amount of set-up time or material that may be required to produce the product. The award of contracts or programs can be a lengthy process, which in some circumstances can extend well beyond 24 months. Upon occasion, we commit resources to potential contracts or programs that we ultimately do not win.
 
Our objective is to increase the value we provide to the customer on an annual basis beyond the contractual terms that may be contained in a supply agreement. To achieve this objective, we commit to the customer that we will continuously look for ways to reduce the cost, improve the quality, reduce the cycle time and improve the life span of the products we supply the customer. Our ability to deliver on this commitment over time is expected to have a significant impact on customer satisfaction, loyalty and follow-on business.
 
We have signed long term supply agreements with Detroit Diesel, Volvo, Transmisiones y Equipos Mecanicos, S.A. de C.V. (“Tremec”) and Sistemas. We have also been awarded purchase orders for various products and components from American Axle, Meritor, and Dana. We have launched the Sypris Ultra® axle shaft with Detroit Diesel and have strong interest from others within the customer base who are interested in this patented product. We are continuing to explore other opportunities as they arise and have a significant number of outstanding quotations in progress, but there can be no assurances that our efforts to develop new sources of revenues will be successful.
 
Competition
 
The markets that we serve are highly competitive, and we compete against numerous domestic and international companies in addition to the internal capabilities of some of our customers. In the industrial manufacturing markets, we compete primarily against other component suppliers such as Ramkrishna Forgings Limited, Mid-West Forge, Inc., GNA Axles Limited, Brunner International, Inc., Bharat Forge, Commercial Forged Products, Spencer Forge and Machine, Inc., Traxle, SPX Flow, Inc., T.D. Williamson Inc. and National Oilwell Varco, Inc., certain of which serve as suppliers to many Tier I and smaller companies. In the aerospace and defense electronics market, we compete primarily against companies such as Celestica Inc., Jabil Circuit, Inc. and Spartan Corporation. We may face new competitors in the future as the outsourcing industry evolves and existing or start-up companies develop capabilities similar to ours. In addition, we will face new competitors as we attempt to increase and expand our business.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include the availability of capacity, currency exchange rates (especially in low-cost countries), technological capability, flexibility, financial strength and timeliness in responding to design and schedule changes, price, quality and delivery. Although we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to many of these factors, some of our competitors, as compared to us, are larger and have greater financial and operating resources, greater geographic breadth and range of products, customer bases and brand recognition than we do. We also face competition from manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers that continually evaluate the relative benefits of internal manufacturing compared to outsourcing.
 
Suppliers
 
For portions of our business, we purchase raw materials and component parts from our customers or from suppliers chosen by our customers, at prices negotiated by our customers. When these suppliers increase their prices, cause delays in production schedules or fail to meet our customers’ quality standards, these customers have typically agreed to reimburse us for the costs associated with such price increases and not to charge us for costs caused by such delays or quality issues. Accordingly, our risks are largely limited to accurate inspections of such materials, timely communications and the collection of such reimbursements or charges, along with any additional costs incurred by us due to delays in, interruptions of, or non-optimal scheduling of production schedules. However, for a meaningful part of our business, we arrange our own suppliers and assume the additional risks of price increases, quality concerns and production delays.

Raw steel and fabricated steel parts are a major component of our cost of sales and net revenue for the industrial manufacturing business. We purchase a portion of our steel for use in this business at the direction of our customers, with periodic changes in the price of steel being reflected in the prices we are paid for our products. Increases in the costs of steel or other supplies can increase our working capital requirements, scrap expenses and borrowing costs.
 
Recently, the Company has encountered higher than normal electronic component shortages and extended lead time issues due to shortages of certain components in the marketplace for the Sypris Electronics business. These shortages and extended lead times are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. This may result in higher prices, extension of our product delivery dates, and increased inventory levels for these components as we seek to secure the necessary components from our suppliers or alternative suppliers.
 
There can be no assurance that supply interruptions or price increases will not slow production, delay shipments to our customers or increase costs in the future, any of which could adversely affect our financial results. Delays, interruptions or non-optimal scheduling of production related to interruptions in raw materials supplies can be expected to increase our costs.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
We own or license a number of patents and trademarks, but our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one patent, trademark, license or technologically related group of patents or licenses.
 
We regard our manufacturing processes and certain designs as proprietary trade secrets and confidential information. We rely largely upon a combination of trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements with customers, suppliers and consultants, and our internal security systems, confidentiality procedures and employee confidentiality agreements to maintain the trade secrecy of our designs and manufacturing processes.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to compliance with regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities, in the U.S. and Mexico, including regulations concerning financial reporting and controls, labor relations, minimum pension funding levels, export and import matters, health and safety matters and protection of the environment. While compliance with applicable regulations has not adversely affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance in the future or that these regulations will not change or that the costs of compliance will not be material to us.
 
We must comply with detailed government procurement and contracting regulations and with U.S. Government security regulations, certain of which carry substantial penalty provisions for nonperformance or misrepresentation in the course of negotiations. Our failure to comply with our government procurement, contracting or security obligations could result in penalties or our suspension or debarment from government contracting, which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.
 
We are required to maintain U.S. Government security clearances in connection with certain activities of Sypris Electronics. These clearances could be suspended or revoked if we were found not to be in compliance with applicable security regulations. Any such revocation or suspension would delay our delivery of products to customers. Although we have adopted policies designed to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, there can be no assurance that the approved status of our facilities or personnel will continue without interruption.
 
We are also subject to comprehensive and changing federal, state and local environmental requirements, both in the U.S. and in Mexico, including those governing discharges to air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. We use hazardous substances in our operations and, as is the case with manufacturers in general, if a release of hazardous substances occurs on or from any properties that we may own or operate, we may be held liable and may be required to pay the cost of remedying the condition. The amount of any resulting liability could be material.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 716 employees, of which 563 were engaged in manufacturing, 13 were engaged in sales and marketing, 46 were engaged in engineering and 94 were engaged in administration. Approximately 459 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions that expire on various dates through 2019. Excluding certain Mexico employees covered under an annually ratified agreement, collective bargaining agreements covering 36 employees expire within the next 12 months. Our ability to maintain our workforce depends on our ability to attract and retain new and existing customers. Although we believe overall that relations with our labor unions are positive, there can be no assurance that present and future issues with our unions will be resolved favorably, that negotiations will be successful or that we will not experience a work stoppage, which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
