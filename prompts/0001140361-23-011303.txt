Our Mission

 
We power recommendations for the Open Web, helping people all around the world discover things they may like, but never knew existed.

 
Our Company
 
 Taboola is a technology company that powers recommendations across the Open Web with an artificial intelligence, or AI-based, algorithmic engine that we have developed over the past 15 years. Taboola has also recently expanded more directly into e-Commerce, allowing its partners with digital properties the ability to use its platforms to display advertising suited to the audiences of those partners’ web sites or other digital services.
 
We think of ourselves as a search engine, but in reverse — instead of expecting people to search for information, we recommend information to people or enable our partners to use our technology. You’ve seen us before: we partner with websites, devices, and mobile apps, which we collectively refer to as digital properties, to recommend editorial content and advertisements on the Open Web, outside of the closed ecosystems of the walled gardens such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon.
 
Digital properties use our technology platforms to achieve their business goals, such as driving new audiences to their sites and apps, or increasing engagement on site — and we don’t charge them for these services. We also provide a meaningful monetization opportunity to digital properties by surfacing paid recommendations by Advertisers. Unlike walled gardens, we are a business-to-business, or B2B, company with no competing consumer interests. We only interact with consumers through our partners’ digital properties, hence we do not compete with our partners for user attention. Our motivations are aligned. When our partners win, we win, and we grow together.
 
We empower Advertisers,, to leverage our proprietary AI-powered recommendation platform to reach targeted audiences utilizing effective, native ad formats across digital properties. We generate revenues primarily when people (consumers) click on, purchase from or, in some cases, view the ads that appear within our partners’ digital experiences via our recommendation platform. Advertisers pay us for those clicks, purchases or impressions and we share the resulting revenue with the digital properties who display those ads and generate those clicks and downstream consumer actions.
 
Our powerful recommendation platform was built to address a technology challenge of significant complexity: predicting which recommendations users would be interested in, without explicit intent data or social media profiles. Search advertising platforms have access, at a minimum, to users’ search queries which indicate intent, while social media advertising platforms have access to rich personal profiles created by users. In contrast, we base our recommendations on an extensive dataset of context and user behavior derived from the intersection of thousands of digital properties and millions of recommended items, including ads and editorial content.
 
Our annual Revenues grew to $1,401.2 million in 2022, from $1,378.5 million in 2021 and $1,188.9 million in 2020. Over the same three years, our Gross profit grew to $464.3 million, from $441.1 million and $319.5 million, and our ex-TAC Gross Profit grew to $569.6 million, from $518.9 million and $382.4 million, respectively. Our Net income (loss) for the same three years was $(12.0) million, $(24.9) million and $8.5 million, respectively, while our Adjusted EBITDA was $156.7 million, $179.5 million and $106.2 million, respectively, and our Non-GAAP Net Income was $91.4 million, $113.6 million and $59.2 million, respectively. For more information about ex-TAC Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP Net Income, see “Management’s Business Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

 



 Selected 2022 Developments
 
Yahoo Partnership
 
In November 2022, the Company announced it had entered into a 30-year exclusive commercial agreement with Yahoo Inc. (“Yahoo”), under which the Company will power native advertising across all of Yahoo’s digital properties, expanding the Company’s native advertising offering. In connection with the closing of this agreement and related agreements on January 17, 2023, Yahoo and its affiliated parties received an aggregate 24.99% of the outstanding voting and non-voting equity of the Company on a combined post-transaction basis, as well as one representative on our Board of Directors (“Board”). On January 17, 2023, following a recommendation from the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Board appointed Monica Mijaleski, Yahoo's Chief Financial Officer, to serve on the Board as a Class III director with an initial term expiring at the Company’s 2024 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.
Additional Developments and Growth Initiatives
 
 In 2022, our global sales teams continued to develop partnerships with digital properties, and Advertisers. We grew our 2022 Gross Profit by approximately $23.2 million, and ex-TAC Gross Profit by approximately $50.8 million. This equated to year-over-year Gross Profit growth of approximately 5% and ex-TAC Gross Profit growth of approximately 10% on a reported basis, and approximately -1% of ex-TAC Gross Profit growth on a pro forma basis with Connexity. Existing digital property partners were negatively impacted by lower yields due to weaker demand on our platform, reflecting the current macroeconomic conditions and the impact on advertising spend. On a pro forma basis, this was mostly offset by growth through the acquisition of new customers. Notably, in 2022 we announced new commercial agreements with premium publishers, including Gray TV, Penske Media, Time.com, BuzzFeed Japan, HuffPost, Prisa, Grupo Godó, Network18, United Internet Media, Dumont, Kicker and Media News Group. We also signed key renewal agreements with CBSi, Tegna, Telemundo, Reach PLC, FAZ, Cox Media Group, Fox Sports, Associated Press, Altice News, Insider, Le Point, E! Online, Hearst UK and Slate.


In 2022, we also continued to invest in our three primary focus areas: performance advertising, e-Commerce and header bidding. We are driving continuous improvement in performance advertising and investing in our product for performance Advertisers, having significantly increased the number of engineers dedicated to those initiatives to help achieve our goal of becoming the best choice for performance Advertisers that want to reach consumers in the Open Web. Additionally, e-Commerce gained meaningful momentum with Dynamic Creative Optimization (DCO) rolling out, and in February 2023 we announced that TIME will be launching our new Taboola Turnkey Commerce solution. Lastly, we are making significant investments in header bidding which we believe will allow us to expand beyond our traditional bottom of article placements and continue to grow our share of the Open Web. In the second quarter of 2022, we fully deployed our new bidding technology on Microsoft's digital properties, pursuant to our agreement signed in December 2021. Throughout 2022 we dedicated resources to algorithm learning and optimizing our bidder, in close collaboration with Microsoft and during the fourth quarter, we began shifting our focus to exploring new supply utilizing this technology. Yahoo has become a fourth primary focus area as a result of the January 2023 closing of agreements related to our Yahoo partnership.
 
Additionally in 2022, as part of our “Taboola Anywhere” strategy, Taboola News, our version of “Apple News” but for Android devices, exceeded $50 million in annual revenue. In addition to this growth, we believe there is strategic value to our overall core business as publishers gain increased traffic from Taboola News.
  
Industry Trends

 
Advertising Budgets Shift to Digital Marketing. As we have witnessed over the last decade, advertising budgets continue to shift from traditional media, such as print newspapers, magazines and television, to digital channels. No longer a trend, a change in consumer attention to digital properties has become a lasting movement, giving Advertisers an opportunity to reach increasing numbers of consumers at scale with relevant content and precise targeting, thereby driving a higher return on their investment.
Walled Gardens Dominate Digital Advertising Spend. According to eMarketer, more than half of digital advertising budgets are spent within the closed ecosystems of tech giants like Google, Facebook and Amazon, which we refer to as “walled gardens.” With the proliferation of these walled gardens and the time spent by consumers within them, the Open Web is fighting for user attention and as a result for advertising dollars.
 



 Highly Fragmented Open Web. According to our estimates, Advertisers spent approximately $70 billion advertising on the Open Web in 2022. Because the Open Web is, by definition, highly fragmented, it is harder for Advertisers to access than the walled gardens.
 
The Technology behind Digital Advertising has become Increasingly Complex. Technologies for more automated and efficient buying and selling of digital advertising have been gaining traction for several years with both advertising buyers and digital properties. The ability to collect, collate and analyze intent data points using AI and machine-learning technology is a key differentiator for Advertisers, digital properties and advertising intermediaries. Data insights can now be used to optimize digital advertising campaigns in ways that were not previously possible. This means that advertising intermediaries who do not have access to data or are not using AI to power their platforms may be at a disadvantage.
 
Shift from Offline Shopping to Online Shopping and e-Commerce. Online shopping has been growing consistently 15-20% and continuing to take share from offline shopping in physical stores. This trend has been significantly accelerated by the recent pandemic, leading to significant current and future expectations for continued hyper-growth of both online shopping and advertising spending by online retailers and e-Commerce companies.
 
Native Format Proliferation. According to eMarketer, native ads - ads that match the look, feel and function of the media format in which they appear, such as those used by Taboola - accounted for approximately 62% of total U.S. display ad spending in 2022, and spending on native ads in the U.S. is forecasted to grow by approximately 12% in 2023. Native advertising is a format that has been popularized by social media and is now familiar to consumers.
 
Increasing Focus on Privacy and the Disappearance of Third Party Cookies. Government regulators, consumers, and technology companies recently turned their attention toward the use of personal data and related privacy practices. This has led to increased regulation, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, its equivalent in the United Kingdom (commonly referred to as the UK GDPR), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act), or CCPA. In parallel, major Internet browsers, such as Safari and Firefox are already blocking third party cookies, while Google Chrome is expected to phase out third-party cookies completely by 2024.. These changes pose a challenge for the digital marketing landscape, which currently relies extensively on third-party cookie data for personalization and must adapt to comply with increasing regulation of personal data.

 
Our Market Opportunity

 
We believe the Open Web needs a technology partner that enables digital properties to compete effectively with the scale and technological advantages of the tech giants. We believe our recommendation technology is applicable to a wide range of digital properties, including websites, apps, devices, and in the future, connected TVs and other mediums.
 
Unlike walled gardens, we are a B2B company with no competing consumer interests. We do not compete with our digital property partners for users’ attention. Our motivations are aligned: when our partners win, we win, and we grow together. This win-win mentality applies to our relationships with digital property partners and our Advertiser clients. Our Advertiser clients typically utilize a performance-based pricing model, which means they only pay us after a desired event, most commonly a click, occurs. In addition, our deep relationships with digital properties offer a compelling value for Advertisers, granting consolidated access to Open Web audiences and, thus, reducing the effects of fragmentation. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we worked with approximately 18,000 Advertisers to serve ads to users across the Open Web and reached over 500 million daily active users, which, for this figure, we calculated as the average daily number of users that have been exposed to Taboola content recommendations at least twice in the preceding seven days. We and our digital property partners both benefit when users stay engaged with content on the digital property. To that end, we share advertising revenue as well as content-consumption data with digital properties, which they can use to make editorial decisions that best accommodate their audiences’ interests and increase user engagement.

 



 What We Do: Our Recommendation Platform

 
At the core of the Taboola platform is our AI-powered predictive recommendation engine, which predicts what people may find interesting by employing unique Deep Learning technology and utilizing a broad range of inputs.
 
In Taboola’s core business, we serve two types of recommendations: (1) editorial, or “organic,” content from the site that the user is currently visiting, in order to engage the user and increase their chances of staying on the site longer; and (2) third-party ads paid for by our Advertiser partners. Our recommendations support text, image and video formats.
 
We generate revenue by enabling Advertisers to place bids for the right to serve their ads to targeted audiences across the Taboola network of digital properties, including some of the most premium sites in the world. As part of our e-Commerce offerings, we also syndicate our retailer Advertisers’ monetized product listings and links (clickable advertisements) into commerce content-oriented consumer experiences on both the Open Web and within the dominant traditional ad platforms.

 
 Representative Product Implementation

 
 



 Our Platform for Digital Properties
 
 Through our technology, data and Advertiser relationships, we help digital properties achieve three key goals:
 

• | Engagement: We keep users engaged with the digital property they are currently visiting, helping digital properties grow their business and not lose users to walled gardens. Digital properties work extremely hard to create engaging content and rely, in part, on Taboola to surface that content to the right user at the right time. To that end, the more content people read, the more time they spend on that digital property’s site, and the greater the opportunity for the digital property to monetize their business by, among other things, serving ads and offering subscriptions. In 2022, people clicked on Taboola recommendations tens of billions of times and approximately one-third of those clicks were on editorial content, keeping users on the site that they were on. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Audience: Digital properties using our platform can grow their audience in seven main ways: (1) using our Taboola Newsroom product, they can use the readership data we compile from across the Taboola network to inform editorial decisions and optimize their content strategy, ultimately bringing new users to their property; (2) creating audience exchange programs between their own sites and those of other digital properties on our network, diversifying their audiences and introducing their content to new users; (3) acquiring new quality audiences from across the Taboola network of digital properties; (4) driving subscriptions to newsletters and paid subscriptions which, help bring loyal readers again and again to their site; (5) distributing their editorial content onto devices, OEMs, mobile carriers and more; (6) providing access to structured product content that can be used to create compelling consumer experiences; and (7) delivering insights and real-time analytics that enable the optimization of e-Commerce content strategy to increase engagement and organic traffic generation. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monetization: We enable digital properties to monetize their content with seamlessly integrated native ads, typically displayed in a feed format appearing at the end of an article, as well as other prime locations such as homepages, section fronts and middle of the articles. When people click on these ads or make a purchase, and in certain cases when they view the ads, Advertisers pay us and we then share in this revenue with the digital property on which the click or impression occurred. With the addition of Taboola’s new offerings through its recent acquisition of e-Commerce focused Connexity, Inc., we also offer cost-per-click and cost-per-action monetization of both product listings and links to retailers that reside directly within editorial content. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Platform for Advertisers
 
 Advertisers utilize Taboola’s platform and leverage our AI-powered recommendation engine to reach their audiences throughout the buyer journey, from building brand awareness to increasing customer loyalty. Using Taboola’s predictive engine, Advertisers can engage consumers at the right time with the right content, using text, image or video formats. Taboola allows Advertisers to run campaigns either directly through Taboola, using Taboola’s campaign management dashboard, or programmatically.

 
We believe we offer Advertisers a complement to the walled gardens:
 

• | Massive reach: With an average of over 500 million daily active users in the fourth quarter of 2022, our platform creates opportunities to reach people on the Open Web when they’re most receptive to brand messages and new content.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Targeting: Our recommendation platform allows Advertisers to target their campaigns according to multiple parameters, such as context, user location, device and network connection type. Additionally, we use the Advertiser’s own data to target demographics, interests, “lookalike audiences” and more. Our predictive engine and large readership dataset enable Advertisers to reach their target audiences with the right message, at the right time and in the right context. In contrast with social networks, where Advertisers reach users based on carefully curated personas as well as other signals, our Advertisers reach users based on signals from what people are reading on the Open Web, which we believe is a more authentic representation of their true interests. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Impactful Native Ad Formats: Our close partnerships with premium digital properties allow us to develop highly impactful ad experiences that support a variety of ad formats and achieve diverse Advertiser goals, from awareness, to consideration, to purchase. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Brand Safe: Ads distributed by Taboola are typically served on pages that display editorial content rather than the ubiquitous user-generated content of platforms such as YouTube or Facebook. In addition, our ad platform allows Advertisers to control the properties and topics on which their content appears, ensuring that their ads are displayed within suitable environments. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Measurable Performance-Based Advertising: Performance-based Advertisers only pay when a consumer has actually engaged with the ad unit and in some cases only when a transaction is completed which is typically on a cost per click or cost per action basis. This is a particularly strong proposition for the retailer client advertising because it is a tangible return on the retailer client's media investment. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Recommendation Technology

 
Our R&D team has spent over a decade developing our proprietary AI-based recommendation technology used in our core product, solving an incredibly complex problem — how to construct a personalized recommendation feed from millions of available articles, videos and ads, in real-time, when you have over 500 million daily active users and need to optimize for diverse outcomes and support multiple pricing models.
 
Rather than rely on knowledge of what people are searching for or what they share on social media, our predictive algorithms employ unique Deep Learning technology to develop a powerful model of people’s interests across the Open Web. Our technology performs exceptionally well on diverse types of input data, such as text, images and video, and is designed to discover non-trivial relations between content and users in a specific context. We predict which recommendations users are most likely to engage with based on a broad set of ‘signals’ that fall into the following categories:
 

• | User Behavior. We are experts in analyzing pseudonymized user behavior across the Open Web. We gather a massive amount of content consumption data from users who visit our partners’ digital properties, which our Deep Learning engines then ingest. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Context. Our algorithms ingest contextual signals, such as geographic location of the user, what device the user is using, time of day, day of week, page layout, page language and more. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Analysis of Recommended Items. We analyze recommended items, including paid advertisements, editorial articles, images and videos, to identify signals such as topic, title, thumbnail image, semantics and sentiment. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generating a Rich Recommendation Feed

 
We serve the majority of our recommendations within a feed that was modeled after widely popular social media feeds and adapted for the Open Web. While the feed format provides a good user experience, it requires technological expertise that is an order of magnitude more complex than optimizing a single ad.
 
This is both a competitive advantage and a technological challenge that requires our algorithms to optimize multiple placements simultaneously across an entire web page, while also supporting the unique objectives of our various partners. Indeed, any recommendation we generate takes into consideration the other advertisements and editorial content recommendations that we display in the same feed. The effect of the sum of these parts allows us to predict the user engagement in different contexts, and make algorithmic decisions concerning the content we serve the user next.
 



 In order to populate recommendations within a feed, our technology must consider the whole page, and recommend content or ads within the context of that page. This has implications both on the algorithms to predict engagement, as well as on how ad auctions are conducted. We have built an efficient algorithm to estimate the incrementality of new items based on what is already in the feed, and taking into account both how strong the item is standalone, as well as how similar it is to the other items already in the feed.
 
Additionally, our Deep Learning engine allows us to optimize for multiple objectives simultaneously, which delivers efficacy to Advertisers, increases user engagement and supports the achievement of many other business goals 6in tandem. As opposed to other digital ad intermediaries who optimize the placements of a single ad unit in an environment they do not control, we influence, and more often create, the setting in which ads appear as we control the entire feed of content and ads, and optimize across the entire feed, page or session.
 
Lastly, we have built a robust ability to conform our recommendation feeds to the design of our digital property partners’ pages and layouts. Presenting a variable mix of both editorial and paid content in this native format also mitigates the risk of user fatigue, commonly referred to as “banner blindness,” that has been noted in traditional display ads.

 
How We Recommend Editorial Content

 
Recommending editorial, or organic, content produced by digital properties enables us to help our publisher partners keep users active on their site for a longer period of time, increasing their exposure to more personalized editorial content — thus increasing overall satisfaction and loyalty.
 
To successfully recommend editorial content items, we developed algorithms that extract and analyze content consumption patterns from our entire network of digital properties. Our recommendations also rely on our deep understanding of reading habits based on our analysis of redundancy, recency, vertical, longevity, relevance device type and other factors.
 
In order to refine our ability to recommend editorial content even further, we have built multiple crawlers to ingest editorial content, categorize it, and extract named entities and topics using our Natural Language Understanding platform, which transforms human language into a machine-readable format. We also automated the assimilation, classification and generation of creatives, including images, videos, titles and descriptions.
 
We also take into consideration the optimization of recommendations to support our publishers’ goals, including subscriptions, pages per session, session duration, subscriptions to newsletters and more.

 
How We Recommend Ads

 
Recommending ads is particularly complex because the process requires accurately predicting multiple facets of the user’s interaction:
 

• | The probability the user will interact (click on an ad, or go to an Advertiser’s site/app after seeing an ad), given a specific user and context. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The probability a user will convert (into a lead, sales or other KPIs the Advertiser wishes to optimize) after she clicked/viewed an ad, given a specific user and context. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The price of a specific item (we support cost per click (CPC) and cost per thousand impressions (CPM)).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Our ultimate measure of success in recommending ads is achieving the Advertiser’s goals. In order to do so, Taboola’s algorithms are designed to select the right opportunity to engage the right user with the right ad, while at the same time optimizing pricing and selecting the best creative assets to use. Our technology is designed to predict the value of each item and optimize both the advertising creatives and the format mix in each auction.
 



 As described above, in order to make effective recommendations, our technology must first predict a user’s engagement with a given advertisement. When combined with the bid for each item, and the prediction of the conversion, this allows us to calculate the relative value of each item available for recommendation. To create an efficient marketplace, our algorithms support diverse pricing models, including CPC and CPM, and are able to conduct efficient auctions between them in order to maximize available inventory for Advertisers with diverse marketing objectives. We optimize bids for a particular ad, Advertiser, user and context, while factoring in constraints, such as geographic location targeting or audience segment targeting, regardless of pricing model.
 
In order to assist Advertisers in executing efficient and effective campaigns, we developed a pricing automation tool called Smart Bid. Smart Bid is an automated campaign bidding strategy that utilizes platform data to bid effectively in real-time on impressions that are most likely to lead to conversions.
 
To maximize the probability of a user engaging with an ad, we support flexible native ad formats that include images, videos, text and interactive elements; we also support specialized elements, such as product price, discount, number of items left in stock, mobile app rating and more. Selecting the optimal ad also involves determining the best version and format of the ad from a very large number of combinations; Taboola does so by running a scalable infrastructure of multi-variant testing, which in turn allows the algorithm to choose the best creative combination efficiently.
 
 How we Enable Digital Properties to make e-Commerce Recommendations
 
 With our acquisition of Connexity, our solutions have expanded to include e-Commerce focused content and monetization solutions for publishers. From a content point of view, we provide publishers with access to over 500 million product listings that are structured into product categories and enriched with product attributes. We syndicate those enriched offers to publishers, thereby enabling them to create consumer shopping or editorial experiences by embedding those product listings as native content within their websites, apps or social media feeds.
 
There are a variety of implementations in terms of how publishers can access and engage with the content. Technology-savvy enterprise publishers will ingest the entire product listings feed and use their own search engine or content management system to choose how, when and which content to display. Less tech-enabled publishers will call Connexity’s search engine API to retrieve product listing results based on a search query, and then they will publish those product listings within their consumer experience in real-time. Lastly, professional editors or social influencers can use a browser-based editorial tool to hand-pick a specific product to display within their editorial content experience.
 
In each of those cases, from a monetization perspective, we enable the publisher to seamlessly earn revenue on either a CPC or cost-per-action (CPA) for clicks and conversions that are generated by consumer engagement with the product listings or other retail-oriented editorial content.

 
 To enable these publishers to maximize the success of the commerce content initiatives, the company provides a suite of analytics dashboards that showcase real-time feedback on the performance of each of their product listing or editorial placements. In addition, the company also provides insights into industry trends including visibility into the type of content and products that are converting well across the entire network. These real-time feedback loops and insights are critical inputs that drive publishers’ content strategy and decisions about which products to promote. They accrue significant benefits to both publishers and the company in the form of increased yield and significantly differentiate the solution as the network effect is difficult to replicate.

    We are Built for the Open Web as a Complement to the Walled Gardens

 
In support of our win-win approach to partnerships, our recommendation technology is built to operate differently. Because we power editorial recommendations, digital properties typically embed our code directly on their web page. This means we can serve our own first-party cookie, much like what digital properties do on their own sites and applications.
 



 Our recommendation platform allows both digital properties and Advertisers to control their brand identity within Taboola’s network. For example, digital properties can set “acceptance profiles” to determine which types of Advertisers we will recommend, and Advertisers can target or block selected digital properties. To consistently regulate the quality of our network, we also maintain a public content policy and employ a content review team that reviewed over six million items in the fourth quarter of 2022. This combination of technology and human review is designed to create a consistently high level of brand safety and quality content within our network.
 
While developing our recommendation technology, privacy is always at the top of our mind. We have long established and adopted privacy-by-design as a central element of our technology, and product design and development cycles, with a strong commitment to ensuring best practices in privacy, security and safety for our partners and users. Since 2017, we have had a designated Data Privacy Officer along with a team of privacy specialists. These specialists are integrated within our R&D and Product organizations and processes, and consider all facets of user privacy as key elements in the design of any new technology, solution or feature of our recommendation platform. We also perform ongoing privacy impact assessments to monitor potential risks during the product lifecycle and proactively mitigate those risks.

 
 Infrastructure
 
 To successfully deliver optimized recommendations to over 500 million daily active users, and 500,000 recommendation related requests every second, we developed powerful software and hardware infrastructures from the ground up.
 
Our data infrastructure was designed and implemented with several principles to ensure both very high accuracy and high speed to process and ingest every new data input at a very high scale and throughput. This infrastructure continuously “feeds” the predictive Deep Learning models, granting access to rich user history and enabling enrichment of data.
 
In order to support the massive amount of text analysis, processing, named entities and general semantic understanding, we have built a Natural Language Understanding platform with a large scale knowledge graph. Designed to recognize multiple languages, topics, concepts, named entities and categories for the entire Taboola platform, this platform is built using Deep Learning technologies.
 
The ability to control the entire feed across multiple canvases is enabled by building state of the art client-side technologies to render and serve a rich feed of content across billions of devices, canvases and user touch points. This process operates within strict SLA and performance constraints, which requires us to develop our technology to work efficiently on low-end and high-end devices and canvases.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we utilized approximately 10,000 servers; four back-end data centers processing over 100TB of data per day to train our AI engine; and seven front-end global data centers that, together, have served up to one trillion recommendations monthly. We use around 500,000 CPUs and GPU cores, 2.2TB of memory and around 50,000TB of storage overall.
 
Deployment of our code to the production environment is fully automated and includes execution of tens of thousands of automated tests for each code change, using AI to locate anomalies in the code to prevent errors. This allows our R&D to develop software quickly and enables us to continuously deliver reliable code and AI models to production. To address the extreme complexity of operating at such a massive scale, we use cutting-edge technologies, such as Tensorflow, Spark, Cassandra and Kafka, as well as highly sophisticated code we developed to allow these tools to meet our scale and reliability requirements.

 



 Our Team

 
We have assembled a world class team of engineers and data scientists with a business-focused, innovative engineering culture. We have access to top talent in Asia, Europe, Israel, and the U.S., including very strong talent in AI, Deep Learning, high-scale infrastructure and browser-based technologies. We believe our engineering culture plays a key role in our success: we assign business KPIs to R&D teams so technological decisions and priorities are aligned with business needs; we empower engineers to own features end-to-end, from ideation to full adoption; and we put special emphasis on collaboration. Our engineering culture relies strongly on experimentation and multi-variants testing. We continuously deploy and run hundreds of different AI models, UI variations and optimizations, in effect measuring hundreds of KPIs. We build our infrastructure such that it enables this culture of continuous improvement.
Our Competitive Strengths

 
We believe the following key strengths provide us with competitive advantages:
 

• | Performance of our AI Technology. We have spent 15 years developing our AI-powered recommendation technology to drive high yield for digital properties, high returns on advertising spend for Advertisers, and relevant recommendations to consumers, who spend more time consuming content on digital properties. Similarly our recent e-Commerce investment uses AI powered technology to drive optimized performance for Advertisers and digital properties. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | More than Monetization. The value we provide to digital properties goes beyond monetization. Our technology helps digital properties grow their audience by optimizing audience exchange programs; recommending content created by the digital properties to increase the time consumers spend on these properties; helping editorial teams make data-driven decisions, and more. We work daily with our extensive network of global digital properties to improve our platform and create more value for the entire Taboola network. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exclusive, Multi-Year Partnerships with Premium Digital Properties. We have established long-standing, and in many cases exclusive relationships with digital properties on the Open Web. They have chosen to work with Taboola across all types of platforms, including desktop, mobile and tablet devices. This provides Taboola and Taboola Advertisers with predictable access to audiences and supply.

• | Direct Relationships with Advertisers. We work directly with the majority of the Advertisers that use our platform. This allows us to build strong relationships, help Advertisers succeed on our platform, and evolve our technology based on direct feedback.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High Reach and Scale. We have more than 500 million daily active users across the globe, enabling Advertisers to run campaigns at scale.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Network Effect. As more digital properties use our platform, we gather more content consumption data. More data makes our AI-driven algorithms more effective in making predictions, which in turn enables us to deliver better performance for Advertisers, which drives higher yields for digital properties. These higher yields make it easier to retain digital properties and acquire new partners. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Founder-led Experienced Management Team. Our founder, Adam Singolda, has successfully led the company as CEO since the company began operations in 2007. Most of Taboola’s senior management has worked together with our founder for many years: the average tenure of our senior management is over eight years, demonstrating strong execution and achieving rapid growth. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong Financial Profile. We designed our business to be highly scalable, with a focus on sustainable long-term development. Since we began operations in 2007, we have demonstrated a track record over time of growth in revenue, gross profit and ex-TAC Gross Profit. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Not Dependent on Third Party Cookies. Our direct integration with many digital properties has helped us navigate changes in the industry. Our engineers continue to work closely with industry stakeholders to ensure we will be prepared if third-party cookies are fully blocked, as many industry observers expect, and we continue to invest in innovative solutions that deliver relevant and engaging discovery experiences for our users. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Opportunities

 
We intend to grow our business by focusing on the following key areas:



• | Continued Investment in AI. Continuously investing in our AI technology is at the heart of what we do. We believe AI is critical to engaging Open Web users and will ultimately provide better service and greater monetization to Advertisers and digital properties, increasing our yields and accelerating our growth. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow our Core Digital Property and Advertiser Client Base. While we already have an extensive network of global digital properties and Advertisers, we believe the efficacy of our recommendation platform gives us the opportunity to expand our partnerships and client base even further, as demonstrated by our 30-year partnership with Yahoo which closed in January 2023. We expect to continue investing in our technology, expanding our global presence, and growing our sales and client service teams to support further growth. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Add User Touchpoints. At our core, Taboola is a recommendation engine. We believe many types of digital properties need a recommendation engine to engage their consumers, find new audiences and monetize. This includes e-Commerce websites, connected TVs, devices and more. In 2018, we launched Taboola News, an offering which seamlessly integrates premium content from our digital properties into connected devices. We believe our existing partnerships with leading device manufacturers and mobile carriers, as well as potential future partnerships with connected TV vendors and others, presents a substantial growth opportunity for both Taboola and our partners. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Add New Types of Recommendations. From experience, we know recommendation engines become better when they are able to recommend a greater variety of content. For example, in 2016, we predicted that video content presented a huge opportunity for Advertisers to reach their audiences in a highly impactful way, for digital properties to drive better monetization and for users to engage with suggested videos, similar to how they are used on social networks such as Instagram. To that end, we added support for video formats in our recommendation platform and saw significant returns from doing so. Similarly, we believe there is opportunity to further diversify our recommendation offerings and intend to invest in new formats and advertising partnerships to improve both consumer experience and yield. The ability to display a variety of media formats in novel combinations is key to preventing “banner blindness” that plagues traditional display formats and making our recommendation engine even better. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | E-Commerce. We have expanded into the e-Commerce market through our acquisition of Connexity, which strengthens our data, pairing our readership data with purchasing data that can make our AI better, grow yield and make our advertising partners more successful. Our expansion into e-Commerce aligns with Taboola’s overall business strategy, which is about working directly with both Advertisers and publishers, serving high quality advertising experiences that do not depend on cookies. E-Commerce is also the way for us to diversify what we recommend - to recommend products - and to grow our yield for publishers, which helps us become even more competitive. These new capabilities will provide merchants, and publishers, large and small, more opportunities to scale outside of the walled gardens, making the open web thrive. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue Value-Enhancing Acquisition Opportunities. The Open Web remains highly fragmented, which may present attractive opportunities for us to grow through strategic and value-enhancing acquisitions. We will continue to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in light of changing industry trends and competitive conditions. However, given the level of effort we anticipate in launching our partnership with Yahoo, we would expect any acquisitions that we consider to either be small and very simple to integrate or dramatically value-enhancing.

Our Business Partners

 
We primarily have two types of business partners: digital properties that use Taboola to drive new audiences, engagement and monetization; and Advertisers, and their agencies, that use Taboola to achieve a variety of marketing objectives.
Digital Properties

 
Taboola had approximately 15,000 digital property partners in the fourth quarter of 2022, including many premium properties such as Microsoft, NBCUniversal, CBSi, The Independent and El Mundo. These partners value our ability to drive new audiences to their sites, engage their users, and monetize their digital properties, while our data insights assist them in making informed editorial decisions. Our value is evidenced by our many multi-year, exclusive partnerships. As of December 31, 2022, our average contract term length with our digital properties was over two years as measured by contract duration at inception; some of our largest partners have even longer-term agreements.
 
Microsoft is our largest partner. Other than Microsoft, no other digital property partner accounted for 3% or more of our Revenues generated from Advertisers on digital properties in 2022.

 
Advertisers
 
 We had approximately 18,000 Advertisers working with us directly, or through advertising agencies, worldwide during the fourth quarter of 2022. The vast majority of our Revenues comes from Advertisers working with us directly, rather than via an agency. We support the leading programmatic channels via integrations with leading demand side platforms, or DSPs. Thanks to the effectiveness of our recommendation engine, many of our Advertiser clients are considered “always on,” which means they continuously invest on our platform, rather than running finite campaigns.
 
Our Advertiser customer base is highly diverse. Some of the verticals we have seen strong adoption in are health & fitness, finance, hobbies & interests, technology & computing, home & garden, shopping and automotive. Our ten largest Advertisers accounted for less than 11% of total Revenues on our network in 2022, with none larger than 3%.

 
Sales and Marketing

 
To support our “win-win” approach to working with both digital properties and Advertisers, we employ a global sales team tasked with signing new partners and growing existing implementations. Our team is deployed around the world with sales hubs in Bangkok, London, Los Angeles, New York, and Sao Paulo, supported by regional satellite offices in order to best serve our geographically diverse client base.
Selling to Digital Properties

 
Our sales teams are responsible for adding new partnerships with digital properties. Once a digital property joins our network, our account management team works with the digital property’s stakeholders to understand their goals, help them reach those goals, and identify new opportunities for mutual growth on an ongoing basis.
Selling to Advertisers

 
We sell to Advertisers through our global sales team and a “self-service” website. Our sales team onboards new customers, mostly large Advertisers, through direct outreach from one of our international sales offices. Our account management teams provide ongoing guidance and data insights that inform campaign strategies and help Advertisers learn how to maximize their return on investment with Taboola. Advertisers can also choose our self-service platform to launch and manage campaigns. Outside of account managers, we support Advertisers through our online Help Center, in-product instructions, and a large number of video tutorials.
Marketing
 
 To support our global sales force, our marketing team presents at industry conferences and hosts webinars and customer events. In addition, our marketing team invests in public relations, advertises online to build brand awareness and acquire new customers, creates case studies, sponsors third-party research, authors data insight reports, creates marketing collateral, publishes blog posts and creates and sponsors events online and in-person.
Competition
 
 We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our main competition for advertising budgets and digital property partnerships are walled gardens and advertising intermediaries:
 
Walled Gardens. We compete for advertising dollars with the closed ecosystems of technology companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. In many cases we also compete with those companies, in particular Google, for real estate on digital properties. As described above, unlike the walled gardens, our business is based on a “win-win” model of partnership, where we do not compete with our partners and our goals are aligned.
 
Advertising Intermediaries. A large number of companies provide a solution to one or more of the steps involved in the buying and selling of advertisements online. These include The Trade Desk, Magnite, PubMatic, Xandr, Outbrain, Plista, TripleLift, RevContent, Teads and others. While these companies may be in competition with us, some are also partners of ours.
 
When competing for Advertiser business, we compete for budgets based on price, reach, speed, brand safety and performance. When competing for digital properties’ business, we are measured on our ability to generate revenue and support other business goals, such as audience development.


 Intellectual Property

 
Our proprietary recommendation engine and associated algorithms and technologies are key to our success, and we rely upon a combination of trade secret, trademark, copyright, and patent laws in the United States and abroad as well as confidentiality agreements and technical measures to establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property and protect our proprietary recommendation engine and associated algorithms and technologies.
 
Historically, we have not patented our proprietary technology in order to keep our technology architecture, trade secrets, and engineering roadmap private; however, as of December 31, 2022, we own approximately twenty issued patents. We also own registrations for certain domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. Additionally, we rely upon common law protection for certain trademarks. We generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with our partners and clients with whom we conduct business, in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information.
 
Our proprietary, internally developed know-how is also an important element of our intellectual property portfolio. The development and management of our platform requires sophisticated coordination among many specialized employees. To protect our technology, we implement multiple layers of security and our data protection measures are ISO 27001 certified.

 
Taboola’s General Privacy Practices

 
Taboola is committed to protecting personal data and providing users transparency and control over the use of their data in online advertising. We seek to strictly enforce our privacy and data protection policies, knowing this is important to our partners, clients, users and vendors.
 
Historically, we have not collected data that would enable the direct identification of Internet users. As of December 31, 2022, we used only pseudonymous data about Internet users on our platform to manage and execute digital advertising campaigns. We either collect this data directly from users’ devices or it is passed to us by third parties. We provide consumers with notice about our use of cookies and our collection and use of data in connection with the delivery of targeted advertising and allow them to opt-out from the use of data we collect for the delivery of targeted advertising.
 



 We are members of or participants in industry self-regulatory organizations, including the Digital Advertising Alliance, the Digital Advertising Alliance Canada, and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance. Taboola also adheres to the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, and the IAB Europe OBA Framework. In addition, Taboola is a proud member in good standing of the Network Advertising Initiative, an association dedicated to responsible data collection use in digital advertising, and we adhere to the NAI Code of Conduct for Web and Mobile. Taboola also has partnerships with a number of industry groups, including the Trustworthy Accountability Group.
 
Our privacy team delivers company-wide privacy training, enforces our privacy policies and is integral to ensuring that we consider the privacy implications in all aspects of our proprietary platform. We regularly review and document our internal privacy policies, amend existing policies as necessary, and seek to enforce these policies with our clients, publisher partners and vendors.
 
Privacy and data protection laws and regulations play a significant role in our business. Our ability to collect, augment, analyze, use, share and otherwise process data relies upon the ability to uniquely identify devices across websites, and applications, and to collect data about user interactions with those devices for purposes such as serving relevant ads and measuring the effectiveness of ads. Federal, state and international laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and other processing of personal data by advertising networks, Advertisers and digital properties is frequently evolving. This includes those related to the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tools to collect data about interactions with users online. Taboola’s operation of its platform and services is subject to numerous U.S. and global privacy regulations, including, without limitation, the following: the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, the United Kingdom's General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act), China’s Personal Information Protection Law, South Korea’s Personal Information Protection Act, Turkey’s Law on the Protection of Personal Data, and New Zealand’s Privacy Act 2020.

 
Privacy Regulation in the U.S.

 
In the United States, at both the federal and state level, there are laws that govern activities such as the collection, use and other processing of personal data by covered companies. At the federal level, online advertising activities and data processing activities are subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commision, which has regularly relied upon Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to enforce against unfair and deceptive acts and practices, including alleged violations of consumer privacy interests. Some proposed and newly enacted legislation has affected and will continue to affect our operations and those of our industry partners.
 
For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020), or CCPA, defines “personal information” broadly enough to include online identifiers provided by individuals’ devices, such as IP addresses, and establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses. The CCPA also imposes stringent obligations on companies regarding the level of information and control they provide to users about the collection and sharing of their data. Other states have enacted, or are considering enacting, similar legislation, with at least four such laws (in Virginia, Connecticut, Colorado and Utah) having taken effect, or scheduled to take effect, in 2023.

 
Privacy Regulation in Europe
 
 Our business activities are also subject to foreign legislation and regulation. In the European Economic Area or EEA, separate laws and regulations (and member states’ implementations thereof) govern the processing of personal data, and these laws and regulations continue to impact us. Like the CCPA, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR defines “personal data” broadly, and it enhances data protection obligations for “controllers” of such data and for service providers, called “processors,” processing the data. It also provides certain rights, such as access and deletion, to the individuals about whom the personal data relates and we have adapted our services to accommodate such rights. The digital advertising industry has collaborated to create a user-facing framework, which we use as of December 31, 2021, for establishing and managing legal bases under the GDPR and other EEA privacy laws including the EU Directive 2002/58/EC (as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC).
 



 For the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the U.S., we rely upon direct contractual agreements between Taboola’s European corporate entity, Taboola Europe Limited, and Taboola’s U.S. corporate entity, Taboola, Inc., based on the European Union’s standard contractual clauses. These contractual agreements obligate Taboola’s U.S. operations to uphold adequate data protection measures (appropriate safeguards, enforceable data subject rights, and effective legal remedies for data subjects) on all personal data that Taboola transfers to the U.S. from the EEA on its own behalf and on behalf of its clients and partners. However, standard contractual clauses have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny and the legal bases for cross-border data transfers are constantly evolving. A recent decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (“Schrems II”) ruled that standard contractual clauses are not sufficient, on their own, to provide appropriate safeguards for transfers of personal data from the European Union, or EU, to the U.S. (and other non-EEA countries) and that companies that engage in these transfers, like Taboola, need to undertake data transfer risk assessments and implement any “supplementary measures” necessary to address any risks identified in order to ensure that the data they transfer continues to be protected to a standard that is essentially equivalent with the GDPR. While the European Commission announced in March 2022 that an agreement in principle had been reached between EU and U.S. authorities regarding a new transatlantic data privacy framework, no formal agreement has been finalized, and any such agreement, if formalized, is likely to face challenge at the Court of Justice of the European Union.
 
 Additionally, since January 1, 2021, when the transitional period following Brexit expired, we have been required to comply with the so-called UK GDPR (combining the GDPR and the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act of 2018). While the UK GDPR currently imposes substantially the same obligations as the GDPR, the UK GDPR will not automatically incorporate changes to the GDPR going forward (which would need to be specifically incorporated by the United Kingdom government). Moreover, the United Kingdom government has publicly announced plans to reform the UK GDPR in ways that, if formalized, are likely to deviate from the GDPR, all of which creates a risk of divergent parallel regimes and related uncertainty, along with the potential for increased compliance costs and risks for affected businesses.

 
 Privacy Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region

 
Our business activities are also subject to legislation and regulation in the Asia-Pacific region. Following the implementation of the GDPR, many jurisdictions have moved to amend, release, review and strengthen their existing data privacy and cybersecurity laws, and there has been a progressive effort in the region to work towards coordination of their otherwise disparate laws. Many countries have also sought out adequacy decisions from the EU. New Zealand’s updated Privacy Act and South Korea’s amendments to its Personal Information Protection Act, which went into effect in 2020, and China’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), which went into effect in 2021, largely align with requirements of the GDPR. Thailand and Japan’s new similar updates and regulations will also become effective in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Other jurisdictions, such as India, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, are reviewing their existing privacy regimes, with an eye toward similar privacy and data protection developments.
 
To address this range of developments, Taboola’s privacy and data protection program is largely rooted in the GDPR and ISO 27001 security standards, and any international data transfers from the Asia-Pacific region are governed by direct contractual agreements between the regional entities and Taboola’s Israeli parent corporate entity, Taboola.com Ltd. Otherwise, our privacy team works to oversee compliance with these Asia-Pacific regional requirements and to address compliance with our region-specific clients and business teams.
 
 Human Capital
 
 We strive to create a diverse, inclusive and ambitious environment where every employee can discover and unleash their potential to achieve individual and collective success. Our employees are our most valuable asset.
Employees

 
On December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1,815 employees, the majority of which have been employed by Taboola for over two years (including service periods of persons employed by Connexity prior to Taboola’s acquisition of Connexity). We have approximately 500 employees working in research and development, with an average tenure of four years.
 
As of December 31, 2022, our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, except as required by law under arrangements in France, Spain, and Brazil, covering a total of approximately 75 employees. We have never experienced a general strike or similar work stoppage.
 
 Transparency
 
 The ability to be transparent and share and discuss our business challenges and opportunities openly and broadly with all our employees is important to our success. We promote an open dialogue with our employees through all-hands meetings, usually twice a month, which include Q&A sessions with senior leadership. We conduct annual and topic-specific employee feedback surveys which consistently receive 80% or higher response rate. Survey results are shared publicly with our managers and employees. We continue to adjust our investment in human capital based on the feedback from our employees.
Talent Acquisition and Development
 
 We are focused on recruiting and retaining talented employees across the organization, with a particular focus on unique talent in algorithms, product, customer relationship management and many other areas that are critical to our success. We continue to invest to hire and retain top talent in all of our offices, and provide competitive compensation for our employees and a range of flexible benefits, including an industry-leading parental leave policy. We have been consistently recognized by Dun & Bradstreet as a top high-tech company to work for in Israel in 2021 and by Built In as one of the 100 best large companies to work for in Los Angeles 2022. Our strong external reputation led to a quarterly average of over 10,000 candidates applying to work at Taboola in 2022. For new hires, we developed an onboarding program tailored towards their roles and responsibilities. On an ongoing basis, we invest in training and development programs that help our employees achieve their career goals, build management skills and lead their organizations. We have two formal career feedback discussions per year where managers and their employees discuss progress and feedback for each other. We believe in developing and promoting top talent from within: in 2022, one out of every five of our employees was offered an opportunity for career advancement within the company.
Performance and Alignment
 
 We seek to implement a “pay for performance” culture that we believe drives superior results. We invest in our workforce by offering competitive salaries, incentives, and benefits. We align the interests of our employees with those of Taboola through a broad-based equity award program, generally with a four-year vesting schedule. Typically, employee bonus plans are based on both personal and company goals.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 
 In 2020, we launched a global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, or DEI, taskforce. The DEI task force works with our senior management team to address global DEI topics and develop relevant initiatives to ensure we continue to build a culture where every employee feels valued, seen, and heard. We continue to have a mechanism for employees to anonymously voice concerns.

 
 Throughout 2022, we continued to see the results of our initiatives. With respect to finding top diverse talent, we began by assessing our current workforce demographics by region and business unit, and established goals and guidelines in efforts of diversifying our recruitment funnel at the first assessment stage. We invested and enhanced our applicant tracking tool to include DE&I related tracking, allowing us to capture and track self-identification data from applicants. We further invested in strategic partnerships with employment platforms that provide us multi-pronged access to highly skilled underrepresented talent, who may not currently be on our platform, such as Built-In, Ivy Research Council, and Jopwell. As a result, in 2022, we saw that 46% of our new hires were women and 18% of those women were hired into technical positions. In 2022, to track our progress and success at attracting diverse candidates and retaining diverse employees we created a DEI dashboard.
 



 Within the organization, in 2022 we increased the number of Employee Resource Groups from four to seven, and each hasan annual budget to sponsor programming and events. We also have a mentorship program connecting Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) talent to senior leaders. We continue to have a number of global and region-specific initiatives held to promote a culture of inclusion and belonging - such as, workshops, panels, networking events and communities for various interest groups. We also partner with Gold Enterprises to create robust programming for our multi-year DEI training plan.
 
We are committed to building a long-term plan that will help foster a community that is diverse, equitable, and inclusive, both internally and externally.
