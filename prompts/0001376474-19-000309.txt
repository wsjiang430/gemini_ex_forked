ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
Our Company
 We are a specialty coffee company and, we believe, the leading single serve pour over coffee co-packer in the United States. Our mission is to leverage our position as a co-packer at the forefront of the North American single serve pour over coffee market to revolutionize the way single serve coffee is enjoyed in the United States. While the United States is our core market, we also have single serve pour over coffee sales operations in Japan as well as manufacturing and sales operations in Korea. In addition, we plan to opportunistically leverage our strengths and relationships to grow our proprietary NuZee and Coffee Blenders brands in the United States and select international markets.
 We believe we are the only commercial-scale producer of single serve drip cup coffee and that we have contractual protections and certain other advantages in place within the North American market, as outlined by the factors described below. As we have with Kraft Heinz, and in particular their Gevalia Kaffe brand, and Royal Cup Coffee & Tea, we intend to leverage our position to be the commercial manufacturer of choice for major companies seeking to enter the single serve drip cup market in North America. We target existing large, high-margin companies and are paid per-package based on the number of single serve pour over drip cups produced by us. Accordingly, we consider our business model to be a form of tolling arrangement, as we receive a fee for almost every single serve drip cup our co-packing customers sell in the North American market. While we financially benefit from the success of our manufacturing customers through the sales of their respective single serve drip cup products, we are also able to avoid the risks associated with owning and managing the product and its related inventory. As these companies gain market acceptance of single serve drip cup coffee in North America, we plan to leverage that market expansion to further grow our own brands.
 We may also consider co-packaging other products that are complementary to single serve pour over drip coffee and provides us with a deeper access to our customers, such as tea bag coffee.
 Reverse Stock Split
 On October 28, 2019, we completed a l-for-3 reverse stock split, which became effective on November 12, 2019 (the “Reverse Split”). The accompanying financial statements and notes to the financial statements give retroactive effect to the Reverse Split for all periods presented. The shares of common stock retained a par value of $0.00001 per share. Accordingly, the stockholders’ equity reflects the Reverse Split by reclassifying from “common stock” to “additional paid-in capital” in an amount equal to the par value of the decreased shares resulting from the Reverse Split.
 What is single serve pour over coffee?
 Single serve pour over coffee, or hand drip coffee, is a traditional and time-honored technique that pours hot water onto ground coffee with a filter. Proponents of drip coffee believe this method makes better coffee. Single serve pour over coffee uses the same technique without a machine, with the coffee flowing straight into a cup using only hot water and the prepacked coffee filter. The image below compares our single serve pour over coffee to other varieties of hot beverages.
 Revolutionizing the single serve coffee market in North America
 Prior to the success of coffee pods within the last two decades, coffee was primarily consumed at home and via traditional pot-based drip brewers and, to a lesser extent, instant coffee. Pot-based brewers are typically known for good quality coffee that produces multiple cups but not well-suited for single serve alternatives. In recent years with the advent of 

6

coffee pods and increased coffee consumption outside the home, the North American market has been focused on speed and convenience. Coffee pods addressed the need for a single serve coffee solution that was viewed as superior to instant coffee. As coffee consumption has also moved outside the home in recent years, consumer preferences have also changed, leading to greater demand for higher quality coffee alternatives, particularly from younger consumers such as millennials.
 Moreover, we believe the typical consumer is increasingly focused on the environmental impact of the product, as well as the taste and quality of the ingredients. We anticipate that pod-based, single serve coffee will face increasing pressure given their heavy reliance on the use of plastics. In our view, consumer preferences in North America have evolved over the last decade to substantially mirror those of Japanese consumers, who have traditionally focused on the taste, eco-footprint and quality of ingredients. Machine-based single serve coffee, which represents approximately 32% of the market in North America, we believe has an immaterial amount of market share in Japan. Single serve drip cups represent approximately 2.5 billion units annually in Japan.
 The saturation of coffee pods in the North American market, coupled with changing tastes, provides our single serve drip cups with a substantial market opportunity in North America. Our single serve drip cup solution also has a number of advantages over other single serve coffee alternatives:
 
Our single serve drip coffee packaging is fully recyclable and does not use any plastics. The majority of the packaging is paper based and biodegradable, while the foil used to package the filter for freshness is recyclable.

Our solution is portable and does not require a machine. Therefore, the consumer investment required to try our product is very minimal (as opposed to machine based solutions). Single serve drip cups can easily travel and have a number of consume-later applications not available to machine based solutions (camping, travel, office, etc.).

We believe single serve drip coffee is more hygienic than other, machine-based single serve alternatives. For example, the use of a machine requires cleaning and maintenance. If not periodically cleaned or if spent pods are not removed timely, the pods can lead to poor taste and bacterial growth.

Unlike machine-based drip systems, the single serve drip coffee is brandable to the cup level.
Why NuZee?
 We seek to establish ourselves as the leading single serve pour over co-packer of single serve pour over coffee for the North American market, and to expand our own brands as single serve pour over coffee gains market acceptance. We believe that top tier brands that want to compete in the North American single serve pour over coffee market will demand the highest levels of quality from their suppliers. We further believe that, as a result of our exclusivity agreement, Level 2 SQF Certification from the Safe Quality Food Institute, operational knowledge and recently announced co-packing arrangements with Kraft Heinz and Royal Cup Coffee & Tea, we are the leader in the single serve pour over coffee market in North America. As a result, we feel we are well positioned to be the co-packer of choice for companies offering single serve pour over coffee products in the North American market.
 We own sophisticated packing equipment developed by East Asian companies for pour over coffee production. We believe these manufacturers are the world leaders for supplying pour over coffee production. We have entered into a written exclusivity agreement with the premier supplier of the type of high-quality packing equipment we use for our products, FUSO Industries Co. Ltd. (“FUSO”), which we believe significantly restricts our North American competitors’ access to this equipment. While our agreement with FUSO provides for a six month cancelation provision, due to the development of our co-packing business over the past several years, we are currently in active negotiations with FUSO as we aim to extend the period of exclusivity and amend our agreement to modify or eliminate the rights to termination. While lower-grade equipment alternatives do exist, availability is extremely limited for the top-grade equipment that generates co-packing products to the exacting specifications we believe large, established companies will demand. For example, the current wait time for the production and delivery of co-packing machinery of the type we use in our Vista, California plant is approximately two years. We understand that as the single serve drip cup gains momentum in the North American market we will face increasing competition. However, we believe we have a significant head start against any new potential commercial manufacturers in that (i) we have an exclusive arrangement with the premier equipment manufacturer, (ii) we have, and continue to develop, manufacturing expertise on increasingly complex and larger orders, 

7

(iii) we have experience dealing with companies of all sizes and their specific requirements (from small roasters to international companies) and (iv) we have SQF Level 2 certification.
 We received Level 2 SQF Certification from the Safe Quality Food Institute, which is a customary requirement to produce for large multi-national and international companies. Obtaining Level 2 SQF Certification may take more than a year to achieve. We are also certified as fair trade, organic, kosher and halal.
 Our primary focus is the development of single serve pour over coffee in the North American market targeting the individual consumer for use at home and office or other settings that would benefit from single serve pour over products, such as our recent expansion into the lodging market through our arrangement with Royal Cup Coffee & Tea, and positioning ourselves as the leading commercial-scale co-packer of single serve pour over coffee products. We may also look to co-package other products that are complementary to single serve pour over drip coffee and provides us with a deeper access to our customers, such as tea bag coffee. The competitive landscape for our services and products can be illustrated as follows:
 
Since 2016, we have been primarily focused on single serve pour over coffee production. Over this time we have developed expertise in the operation of our sophisticated packing equipment and the related production of the single serve pour over product at both our Vista, California facility and at our production operations in Korea. We plan to carry over this expertise to our recently announced Plano, Texas manufacturing facility, which will serve as our new single serve pour over co-packing hub and corporate headquarters to capture the location’s logistical advantages and lower cost structure.
 Our sources of revenue
 Co-packing
 We operate as a third-party contract packager for the finished goods of other major companies operating in the coffee beverage industry. Under these arrangements, we produce and package coffee products according to our customers’ formulations and specifications. We currently focus on fostering co-packing arrangements with larger companies developing pour over coffee products. For example, we recently entered into co-packing agreements with Kraft Heinz, under their Gevalia Kafee® brand, and Royal Cup Coffee & Tea.
 In addition to larger companies, we package for smaller companies that have significant growth potential. For example, we started packaging for Copper Cow in July 2017 and continue to do so today. Copper Cow started with smaller batch, single product SKUs but over the years has meaningfully increased order sizes as well as the number of SKUs. We are continually looking for new exciting companies to work with and grow with like Copper Cow.
 A select list of our current co-packing customers include: Gevalia Kafee (Kraft Heinz), Royal Cup Coffee & Tea, Copper Cow Coffee, Alumbre Coffee, C&C Hawaii Coffee, Lion Coffee, Idyllwild Coffee and Virgin Islands Coffee.

NuZee branded products
 We have developed products and brands for the primary reason of providing completed finished products to showcase to potential co-packing customers. Our products effectively serve as a sort of “sample” to potential customers that include high quality packaging and coffee. We have received indications of interest from some potential customers in co-packing single serve coffee under the customer’s brand using coffee sourced by us as opposed to the customer providing the coffee, which is how we typically co-pack for customers.
 
Barista. Our Barista line of products is a high end product line that, in addition to showcasing our production expertise, also includes what we believe to be some of the best coffee available in a single serve application in the world. We plan to sell Barista via traditional retail channels that do not use “pay for placement” distributors. We also have a number of potential co-packing opportunities in which our customers would contract for us to replicate one or more of our Barista products with their foil and packing, providing further evidence of the high-quality nature of this line and coffee. We expect the Barista product line to be our flagship products that are both sold directly to consumers and used as a sales tool for co-packing customers.

Twin Peaks. We currently sell our Twin Peaks single serve pour over coffee exclusively via Amazon, under Amazon’s accelerator program. This program commenced in April of 2019 and we expect that as Amazon and its customers become more familiar with single serve pour over coffee, we will increase our revenue for this product.

Pine Ranch. Pine Ranch is a tea bag-style coffee that is available in two distinct roasts: a medium roast called “Smooth Blend” and a dark roast called “Bold Blend”. We introduced this product line in the third quarter of 2019. The brand is initially being sold to retailers and at wholesale, and we plan to offer it direct to consumers in 2020. Pine Ranch is available in dispense boxes that are suitable for offices and retail stores. Pine Ranch is also a zero-landfill product that we can showcase to potential co-packing customers as an alternative to the pour over format. We commenced production for our first tea bag style co-packing customer in October 2019.
Our business strategy
 We intend to achieve our mission and further grow our business by pursuing the following strategies:
 •
Continually grow our base of large national or international co-packing customers. We have recently announced a co-packing agreement with a large international company. We are in active discussions with a number of similar sized companies. We believe that, as the U.S. market continues to gain awareness of single serve pour over coffee, we will continue to grow our base of large domestic or international co-packing customers.
•
Co-pack for smaller scale, rapidly growing, innovative coffee customers and capture their growth over time. In addition to co-packing for large domestic or international customers, we believe that select smaller scale, rapidly growing, innovative co-packing customers provide us with different opportunities versus larger customers. For example, smaller scale customers often possess better social media reach and their marketing campaigns have the ability to “go viral.” We believe by selectively choosing high quality smaller customers, we can benefit from growing market acceptable of single serve pour over coffee.
•
Increase our production capacity in response to growing demand for co-packing. We have entered into a lease for our planned manufacturing hub in Plano, Texas. We have started to order equipment, begin the SQF Level 2 certification process and begin other processes to have the facility operational by our second fiscal quarter of the upcoming fiscal year (on or before March 31, 2020). At peak potential capacity, we project the Plano, Texas facility would provide 5 – 6 times the current production capacity of our Vista, California facility. We have started this effort in anticipation of growing demand for co-packing.
•
Strategically grow and expand our international operations that are strategic to our vision. We plan to strategically grow our current international operations as well as potentially expand international if this growth or expansion is strategic to our vision. We believe the Korean market, albeit competitive, still has significant growth potential as well as strong market acceptance for coffee and single serve pour overs. As we look at other potential international manufacturing locations, we look for characteristics similar to the Korean and U.S. markets.

•
Strategically increase the sales of our proprietary brands. We plan to continue to increase the sales of our proprietary brands without utilizing “pay for placement” distributors. We anticipate our direct sales of our proprietary products will benefit as we increase our co-packing revenues because our co-packing customers will help educate consumers on the benefits of single serve pour coffee. We plan to increase our effort on direct sales methodically and concurrently as we increase co-packing revenues and volume.
Industry
 Coffee consumption is at an all-time high. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), global coffee consumption is forecast to reach a record 167.9 million bags in 2019/20 (a bag is equivalent to 60 kilograms). The United States is the country with the highest consumption with 26.8 million bags forecast for 2019/20, up from 23.6 million in 2014/15 (a 2.6 percent compound annual growth rate, or CAGR), according to the USDA.
 


In dollar terms, the global coffee market amounts to US$429.5 billion in 2019, and the market is expected to grow annually by 5.8 percent (CAGR 2019-2023). The United States is the largest market with US$80.9 billion generated in 2019, per a study conducted by Statista.
 
An estimated 63 percent of American adults drink coffee on a daily basis according to the National Coffee Association, and an increasing number of consumers seem to be seeking bolder and more unique coffee experiences. This is evidenced by more Americans’ gourmet coffee consumption reaching a 60/40 advantage over traditional non-gourmet coffee for the first time in the 69-year history of the National Coffee Association’s annual report on coffee consumption.
 
The “at home” segment continues to dominate coffee consumption, with 81 percent of volume consumption attributable to the at home market in 2019, representing a 20 percent revenue share. The market share of the at home segment has been relatively constant over the last few years and is expected to maintain a similar share of coffee consumption in 2019-2023, according to Statista.

10



Single-serve coffee brewing has grown in popularity in recent years, and single-serve brewing machines were the second most popular brewing system after standard drip coffee makers, with 26 percent of American coffee drinkers using them in 2018, per a Statista study. Additionally, and according to an online survey by the National Coffee Association, 42 percent of US households owned a single-cup coffee brewing machine in 2019, up from 1 percent in 2005 and 15 percent in 2014.
 


While consumers have been purchasing single-serve coffee machines to recreate the café style experience at home, there has been an increased focus on environmental sustainability and demand for eco-friendly products. The 2019 Retail and Sustainability Survey by CGS showed that more than two-thirds of respondents consider sustainability when making a purchase and are willing to pay more for sustainable products. In another recent survey of US and UK consumers by Globalwebindex, 42 percent of consumers said that products that have packaging made from recycled products and/or sustainable materials are important in their day-to-day shopping, and more than half said they have reduced the amount of disposable plastic they use in the past 12 months. Greenpeace USA considered coffee pods as “one of the best examples of unnecessary single-use plastics that are polluting our planet” and the big producers of pods having been seeking eco-friendly alternatives. Sustainability is expected to continue to be a big trend in the coffee pod market, especially as some cities and local governments consider bans on the use of single-use plastic pods (akin to bans on plastic straws and plastic bags) and as consumers become increasingly concerned about throwing used plastic pods in landfills, according to Food Dive.

11

We believe that many of the prevalent industry trends – the continued consumption and market growth, the prevalence of “at home” consumption, the popularity of single-serve coffee brewing, the increased focus on unique coffee experiences, and consumers’ shift to eco-friendly and sustainable alternatives – will be favorable to our business.
 
Manufacturing
 
We lease a primary manufacturing facility in Vista, California located at 2865 Scott St Suite 107 which is used for the production of our Single Serve Pour Over Drip Cup line. We also recently entered into a five year lease for a new manufacturing hub in Plano, Texas (just outside of Dallas), which we intend to be operational during the fourth calendar quarter of 2019. In Plano, we plan to have up to 20 packing machines (compared with four, expanding to six in Vista, California) and up to 30 employees. We also partner with three third-party manufacturers to manufacture finished products. We have relationships based on purchase orders in place with suppliers and partners for all components required to deliver a finished NuZee branded product. In particular, we have entered into exclusivity agreements, both written and oral, with certain East Asian companies regarding sophisticated packing equipment for pour over coffee production, including FUSO. Currently, the Company has not made any long-term commitments to any suppliers or production partners that will burden or impair the Company’s ability to operate, though the Company is in the process of renegotiating certain provisions of our agreement with FUSO, including the term and termination rights.
 
We purchase Green Whole Bean Coffee from Serengeti Trading Company located in Dripping Springs, TX on a purchase order basis. The green whole bean is then sent to our roaster at San Diego Coffee, Tea, & Spice, located in Oceanside, CA, where the coffee is roasted/ground/blended with neutracenticals and then packaged into single serve pods and boxed for retail sales.
 
For our products that feature nutraceuticals, we send the raw products (roasted ground coffee and nutraceuticals) to Global Health Trax (“GHT”) for mixing into our proprietary blends. We do not have a written agreement with GHT. Rather, all services performed by GHT are on a purchase order basis. After GHT mixes our coffees, the final product is shipped to us for our coffee blenders single serve drip cups and Twin Peaks pour over and boxed for retail sales. We are in the process of evaluating the future of our line of single cup pods. In the past GHT would ship our product to various co-packers we used for our single cup pods.
 
GHT also ships the blended coffee to our location for packing into our proprietary single serve consumer product, the “Drip Cup”.
 
We conduct business with multiple vendors of packaging material on a purchase order basis.
 
Machinery for production at our Vista location comes from some of the most respected vendors in the industry: Air compression equipment comes from Kaeser Compressor, manufactured in Germany with a local sales and support office in Los Angeles. Nitrogen generation equipment is manufactured by On-Site Gas Systems, and our Drip Cup production is produced on the leading Japanese manufacturer of packaging machines from FUSO. Nitrogen and air compression machinery is capable of handling expansion as the Company expands which helps to minimize any ongoing capital expenditures for machinery.
 
Research and Development
 
We focus our research and development efforts on developing new, innovative, delicious and functional beverages
 
Over the course of the last fiscal year we have maintained a modest R&D budget. With the advent of the functional beverage and new product ideas, we plan to invest more to secure unique flavor and formula profiles but anticipate the out of pocket expense will not be significant as the Company has agreements with flavor and formula design partners to waive development fees in exchange for purchasing the flavorings and ingredients.

12

Intellectual Property
 
We currently own the following United States trademarks: “Coffee Blenders”, “It’s Coffee Reimagined”, “Nude Cup”, “Lean Cup”, “Think Cup”, “Relax Cup”, “Active Cup”, and “Twin Peaks”. The Company intends to continue growing its trademark portfolio in the United States with other related slogans and brands as those products come closer to launch.
 
The Company further intends to expand our brand protections outside of the United States in line with its prospective international growth. As of the date of this report, the Company had registered trademarks “Coffee Blenders”, “Nude Cup”, “Lean Cup”, “Think Cup”, “Relax Cup” and “Twin Peaks” in Japan; registered trademarks “Lean Cup”, “Think Cup” and “Twin Peaks” in Korea; and registered trademarks “Lean Cup”, “Think Cup”, “Relax Cup” and “Active Cup” in China.
 
We intend to aggressively protect, police and assert its intellectual property rights, including product designs, proprietary product research and concepts as well as its trademark portfolio. Although asserting our rights may result in a substantial cost to the Company, our management strongly believes that the protection of our intellectual property rights is a key component of our operating strategy. As a result of our continuing R&D efforts, we may decide to seek additional protection, if applicable, relating to its formulas, process know-how and proprietary flavors.
 
In exiting the Torque energy supplement product businesses we ceased using and abandoned our registered TORQ and TORQ WRENCH trademarks acquired from the HydroPouch Corporation. We also plan to not pursue or contest the use of NuZee as a product brand in association with water and skincare products as we are in the process of or have exited those businesses.
 
International operations
 Japan
 The Japanese market for single serve pour over coffee is mature and, as such, we only have a sales operation in Japan that primarily sells single serve drip coffee via the JP Post catalog under the brand of Castillian Coffee. The JP Post catalog is traditional means of marketing via a physical catalog that is still very effective in Japan. We established our Japanese subsidiary in 2016. Castillian Coffee is one of the best-selling coffee brands on the JP Post catalog.
Korea
 We established our Korean subsidiary in 2018. Our Korean subsidiary is in the early stages of business development of attracting potential customers for co-packing. We are one of many producers of single serve pour over coffee products in Korea and do not have any exclusive rights for this region. Our strategy is to leverage our Korean team’s business relationships to secure large co-packing agreements for the markets in Korea, China and other Asian countries. We believe that our Korean subsidiary will be able to secure meaningful co-packing customers beginning in our 2020 fiscal year.
Competition
 
The beverage industry in general, and the coffee sector in particular, is extremely competitive. The principal areas of competition include pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors, and marketing campaigns. Our Coffee Blenders product is competing directly with Green Mountain brands and licensed brands as well as 3rd party single pour over coffees. Green Mountain brands have enjoyed broad, well-established national distribution through well-funded advertising, and product awareness. In addition, companies and brands manufacturing these products generally have far greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources than we do.
 
Important factors that will affect our ability to compete successfully include taste and functional delivery of our product, trade and consumer promotions, the development of new, unique functions in new and various packaging formats, attractive and unique promotions, branded product advertising, pricing, and the success of our distribution network.

13

We will also be competing to secure distributors who will agree to market our product over those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution, and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets and search placement in online stores.
 
Our Coffee Blenders products will compete generally with all hot liquid refreshments, including specialty coffees and teas as well as nutraceutical beverages such as BulletProof Coffee, Green Mountain Wellness Coffee, Organo Gold Herbal Coffee, Nuvia Trim Coffee, South Beach Java, Javita, and NatureGift Instant Coffee. As a result, we continue to look for significant niche markets where our close attention to customer requirements and superior performance are valued.
 
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2019, we had a total of 19 full-time and part-time employees in the U.S. and five employees in Korea and three employees in Japan.
 
Our operations are overseen directly by management that engages our employees to carry on our business. Our management oversees all responsibilities in the areas of corporate administration, product development, marketing, and research. We intend to expand our current management to retain other skilled directors, officers, and employees with experience relevant to our business focus. Our management’s relationships will provide the foundation through which we expect to grow our business in the future. We believe that the skill-set of our core management team will be a primary asset in the development of our brands and trademarks.
 
We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining arrangements. We believe our relationships with our employees are good.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
Our Coffee Blenders products are marketed and sold as conventional food or beverages for regulatory purposes. Such products are regulated by the FDA. Ingredients in such products must be approved food additives or “Generally Regarded as Safe”. We intend to work with ingredient suppliers, manufacturers, and other trade partners that are compliant with the laws and regulation enforced by the FDA. We have not received, nor are we aware of, any inquiries or other regulatory action from the FDA or any other governmental agency regarding our products and we believe we are in full compliance with all FDA regulations.
 
The advertising, distribution, labeling, production, safety, sale, and transportation in the United States of our products are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Lanham Act, state consumer protection laws, competition laws, federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws, various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations.
