ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Unless the context suggests otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” refer to Kite Realty Group Trust and our business and operations conducted through our directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries, including Kite Realty Group, L.P., our operating partnership (the “Operating Partnership”).

Overview

Kite Realty Group Trust is a publicly-held real estate investment trust which, through its majority-owned subsidiary, Kite Realty Group, L.P., owns interests in various operating subsidiaries and joint ventures engaged in the ownership and operation, acquisition, development and redevelopment of high-quality neighborhood and community shopping centers in select markets in the United States.  We derive revenues primarily from activities associated with the collection of contractual rents and reimbursement payments from tenants at our properties.  Our operating results therefore depend materially on, among other things, the ability of our tenants to make required lease payments, the health and resilience of the United States retail sector, interest rate volatility, job growth and overall economic and real estate market conditions.
As of December 31, 2018, we owned interests in 111 operating and redevelopment properties totaling approximately 21.9 million square feet. We also owned one development project under construction as of this date. Our retail operating portfolio was 94.6% leased to a diversified retail tenant base, with no single retail tenant accounting for more than 2.6% of our total annualized base rent. In the aggregate, our largest 25 tenants accounted for 34.1% of our annualized base rent.  See Item 2, “Properties” for a list of our top 25 tenants by annualized base rent.  
Significant 2018 Activities

Operating Activities

We continued to drive strong operating results from our portfolio as follows:  

• | Realized net loss attributable to common shareholders of $46.6 million, which included $70.4 million of impairment charges;


• | Same Property Net Operating Income ("Same Property NOI") increased by 1.4% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increases in rental rates and an improved tenant mix driven by strong shop leasing activity;


• | We executed new and renewal leases on 315 individual spaces for approximately 1.7 million square feet of retail space, achieving a blended cash rent spread of 6.8% for comparable leases. As part of the total leasing activity, we executed 12 new anchor leases for 297,000 square feet for a blended cash rent spread of 8.4%; 


• | We opened 135 new tenant spaces totaling 602,000 square feet;


• | Our operating portfolio annual base rent ("ABR") per square foot as of December 31, 2018 was $16.84, an increase of $0.52 or 3.2% from the end of the prior year; and


• | Small shop leased percentage was 91.2% as of December 31, 2018, which was an all-time Company high.

Disposition Activities

During 2018, we sold six non-core operating properties for $125 million of gross proceeds that were used to pay down our existing credit facility. These operating retail assets had a weighted average ABR of $12.23, which was 27% lower than the remaining operating portfolio ABR. 
We entered into a strategic joint venture with Nuveen (formerly known as TH Real Estate) by selling an 80% interest in three core retail assets resulting in gross proceeds of $89 million.

Development and Redevelopment Activities

We believe evaluating our operating properties for development and redevelopment opportunities enhances shareholder value as it will make them more attractive for leasing to new tenants and it improves long-term values and economic returns. We initiated, advanced, and completed a number of development and redevelopment activities in 2018, including the following:

• | Eddy Street Commons in South Bend, Indiana – Phase II of Eddy Street Commons is a mixed-use development at the University of Notre Dame that will include a retail component, apartments, townhomes, and a community center. The total projected costs for all components of the project are $90.8 million, of which our share is $10.0 million, although we have provided a completion guaranty to the South Bend Redevelopment Commission and the South Bend Economic Development Commission on the construction of the entire project. The project is currently under construction with a projected stabilization date of late 2020. 

We completed construction of a full-service Embassy Suites hotel at Phase I of Eddy Street Commons, which opened in September 2018. The Company has a 35% ownership interest in the hotel.

• | Under Construction Redevelopment, Reposition, and Repurpose (“3-R”) Projects. Our 3-R initiative continued to progress in 2018 with the completion of six projects. Total costs incurred on these projects were $64.6 million with a composite annual return of 8.6%. 

Financing and Capital Raising Activities.

 In 2018, we were able to maintain our strong balance sheet, financial flexibility and liquidity to fund future growth.  We ended the year with approximately $484.9 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity on our unsecured revolving credit facility. 
In October 2018, we closed on a $250 million ten-year unsecured term loan that extended the weighted average scheduled maturity of the debt portfolio by a full year to 6.2 years and laddered the debt maturity schedule so that no more than 20% of the Company's debt is scheduled to mature in any single calendar year.
We have only $20.7 million of principal scheduled to mature through December 31, 2020, and a debt service coverage ratio of 3.3x as of December 31, 2018.  We have been assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings from two nationally recognized credit rating agencies. These ratings were unchanged during 2018.
Business Objectives and Strategies

Our primary business objectives are to increase the cash flow and value of our properties, achieve sustainable long-term growth and maximize shareholder value primarily through the ownership and operation, acquisition, development and redevelopment of high-quality neighborhood and community shopping centers.  We invest in properties with well-located real estate and strong demographics, and we use our leasing and management strategies to improve the long-term values and economic returns of our properties.  We believe that certain of our properties represent attractive opportunities for profitable renovation and expansion. 

We seek to implement our business objectives through the following strategies, each of which is more completely described in the sections that follow:  

• | Operating Strategy: Maximizing the internal growth in revenue from our operating properties by leasing and re-leasing to a strong and diverse group of retail tenants at increasing rental rates, when possible, and redeveloping or renovating certain properties to make them more attractive to existing and prospective tenants and consumers;


• | Financing and Capital Preservation Strategy: Maintaining a strong balance sheet with sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investment activities. Funding sources include the public equity and debt markets, existing $485 million of cash and available liquidity under revolving credit facility, new secured debt, internally generated funds, proceeds from selling land and properties that no longer fit our strategy, and potential strategic joint ventures.

• | Growth Strategy: Prudently using available cash flow, targeted asset recycling, equity, and debt capital to selectively acquire additional retail properties and redevelop or renovate our existing properties where we believe that investment returns would meet or exceed internal benchmarks; and

Operating Strategy. Our primary operating strategy is to maximize rental rates and occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse tenant base. Most of our properties are located in regional and neighborhood trade areas with attractive demographics, which allows us to maximize occupancy and rental rates. We seek to implement our operating strategy by, among other things:  

• | increasing rental rates upon the renewal of expiring leases or re-leasing space to new tenants while minimizing vacancy to the extent possible;


• | maximizing the occupancy of our operating portfolio;


• | minimizing tenant turnover;


• | maintaining leasing and property management strategies that maximize rent growth and cost recovery;


• | maintaining a diverse tenant mix that limits our exposure to the financial condition of any one tenant or category of retail tenants;


• | maintaining and improving the physical appearance, condition, layout and design of our properties and other improvements located on our properties to enhance our ability to attract customers;


• | implementing offensive and defensive strategies against e-commerce competition;


• | actively managing properties to minimize overhead and operating costs;


• | maintaining strong tenant and retailer relationships in order to avoid rent interruptions and reduce marketing, leasing and tenant improvement costs that result from re-leasing space to new tenants; and


• | taking advantage of under-utilized land or existing square footage, reconfiguring properties for more profitable use, and adding ancillary income sources to existing facilities.

We successfully executed our operating strategy in 2018 in a number of ways, including Same Property NOI growth of 1.4%, a blended new and renewal cash leasing spread of 6.8%, and an increase in our small shop leased percentage to 91.2% as of year end. We have placed significant emphasis on maintaining a strong and diverse retail tenant mix, which has resulted in no tenant accounting for more than 2.6% of our annualized base rent. See Item 2, “Properties” for a list of our top tenants by gross leasable area ("GLA") and annualized base rent.

Financing and Capital Preservation Strategy. We finance our acquisition, development, and redevelopment activities seeking to use the most advantageous sources of capital available to us at the time.  These sources may include the reinvestment of cash flows generated by operations, the sale of common or preferred shares through public offerings or private placements, the reinvestment of net proceeds from the disposition of assets, the incurrence of additional indebtedness through secured or unsecured borrowings, and entering into real estate joint ventures. 

Our primary financing and capital preservation strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and enhance our flexibility to fund operating and investment activities in the most cost-effective way. We consider a number of factors when evaluating the amount and type of additional indebtedness we may elect to incur.  Among these factors are the construction costs or purchase prices of properties to be developed or acquired, the estimated market value of our properties and the Company as a whole upon consummation of the financing, and the ability to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service. 

Strengthening our balance sheet continues to be one of our top priorities.  In February 2019, the Company announced a plan to market and sell up to $500 million in non-core assets as part of a program designed to improve the Company’s portfolio quality, reduce its leverage, and focus operations on markets where the Company believes it can gain scale and generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. The Company currently anticipates that the bulk of the net proceeds will be used to repay debt, further strengthening its balance sheet.
We maintain an investment grade credit rating that we expect will continue to enable us to opportunistically access the public unsecured bond market and will allow us to lower our cost of capital and provide greater flexibility in managing the acquisition and disposition of assets in our operating portfolio. 
5

We intend to continue implementing our financing and capital strategies in a number of ways, which may include one or more of the following actions:  

• | prudently managing our balance sheet, including maintaining sufficient availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility so that we have additional capacity to fund our development and redevelopment projects and pay down maturing debt if refinancing that debt is not desired or practical;


• | extending the scheduled maturity dates of and/or refinancing our near-term mortgage, construction and other indebtedness;


• | expanding our unencumbered asset pool;


• | raising additional capital through the issuance of common shares, preferred shares or other securities;


• | managing our exposure to interest rate increases on our variable-rate debt through the selective use of fixed rate hedging transactions;


• | issuing unsecured bonds in the public markets, and securing property-specific long-term non-recourse financing; and


• | entering into joint venture arrangements in order to access less expensive capital and mitigate risk.

Growth Strategy. Our growth strategy includes the selective deployment of financial resources to projects that are expected to generate investment returns that meet or exceed our internal benchmarks. We implement our growth strategy in a number of ways, including:  

• | continually evaluating our operating properties for redevelopment and renovation opportunities that we believe will make them more attractive for leasing to new tenants, right-sizing of anchor spaces while increasing rental rates, and re-leasing spaces to existing tenants at increased rental rates;


• | disposing of selected assets that no longer meet our long-term investment criteria and recycling the net proceeds into properties that provide attractive returns and rent growth potential in targeted markets or using the proceeds to repay debt, thereby reducing our leverage; and


• | selectively pursuing the acquisition of retail operating properties, portfolios and companies in markets with strong demographics.

In evaluating opportunities for potential acquisition, development, redevelopment and disposition, we consider a number of factors, including:  

• | the expected returns and related risks associated with the investments relative to our combined cost of capital to make such investments;


• | the current and projected cash flow and market value of the property and the potential to increase cash flow and market value if the property were to be successfully re-leased or redeveloped;


• | the price being offered for the property, the current and projected operating performance of the property, the tax consequences of the transaction, and other related factors;


• | opportunities for strengthening the tenant mix at our properties through the placement of anchor tenants such as value retailers, grocers, soft goods stores, theaters, or sporting goods retailers, as well as further enhancing a diverse tenant mix that includes restaurants, specialty shops, service retailers such as banks, dry cleaners and hair salons, and shoe and clothing retailers, some of which provide staple goods to the community and offer a high level of convenience;


• | the configuration of the property, including ease of access, availability of parking, visibility, and the demographics of the surrounding area; and


• | the level of success of existing properties in the same or nearby markets.

In 2018, we completed one development and six 3-R projects at total costs of $79.9 million and an aggregate return on cost of 8.5%.

Competition

The United States commercial real estate market continues to be highly competitive. We face competition from other REITs, including other retail REITs, and other owner-operators engaged in the ownership, leasing, acquisition, and development of shopping centers as well as from numerous local, regional and national real estate developers and owners in each of our markets.  Some of these competitors may have greater capital resources than we do, although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors is dominant in any of the markets in which we own properties. 

We face significant competition in our efforts to lease available space to prospective tenants at our operating, development and redevelopment properties. The nature of the competition for tenants varies based on the characteristics of each local market in which we own properties. We believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting tenants in our market areas are location, demographics, rental rates, the presence of anchor stores, competitor shopping centers in the same geographic area and the maintenance, appearance, access and traffic patterns of our properties.  There can be no assurance in the future that we will be able to compete successfully with our competitors in our development, acquisition and leasing activities. 

Government Regulation

We and our properties are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental, health, safety and similar laws, including: 

Americans with Disabilities Act. Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA"), to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in orders requiring us to spend substantial sums to cure violations, pay attorneys' fees, or pay other amounts. The obligation to make readily accessible accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Affordable Care Act. We may be subject to excise taxes under the employer mandate provisions of the Affordable Care Act ("ACA") if we (i) do not offer health care coverage to substantially all of our full-time employees and their dependents or (ii) do not offer health care coverage that meets the ACA's affordability and minimum value standards. The excise tax is based on the number of full-time employees. We do not anticipate being subject to a penalty under the ACA; however, even in the event that we are, any such penalty would be less than $0.3 million, as we had 144 full-time employees as of December 31, 2018. 

Environmental Regulations. Some properties in our portfolio contain, may have contained or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain underground storage tanks for petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. These storage tanks may have released, or have the potential to release, such substances into the environment. 

In addition, some of our properties have tenants which may use hazardous or toxic substances in the routine course of their businesses. In general, these tenants have covenanted in their leases with us to use these substances, if any, in compliance with all environmental laws and have agreed to indemnify us for any damages we may suffer as a result of their use of such substances. However, these lease provisions may not fully protect us in the event that a tenant becomes insolvent. Finally, certain of our properties have contained asbestos-containing building materials, or ACBM, and other properties may have contained such materials based on the date of its construction. Environmental laws require that ACBM be properly managed and maintained, and fines and penalties may be imposed on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements. The laws also may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.
Neither existing environmental, health, safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results operations, and management does not believe they will in the future. In addition, we have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past. However, we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future. 

With environmental sustainability becoming a national priority, we have continued to demonstrate our strong commitment to be a responsible corporate citizen through resource reduction and employee training that have resulted in reductions of energy consumption, waste and improved maintenance cycles.

Insurance

We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, and rental loss insurance that covers all properties in our portfolio. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage, geographic locations of our assets and industry practice. Certain risks such as loss from riots, war or acts of God, and, in some cases, flooding are not insurable; and therefore, we do not carry insurance for these losses. Some of our policies, such as those covering losses due to terrorism and floods, are insured subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover losses. 
Offices

Our principal executive office is located at 30 S. Meridian Street, Suite 1100, Indianapolis, IN 46204. Our telephone number is (317) 577-5600. 

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had 144 full-time employees. The majority of these employees were based at our Indianapolis, Indiana headquarters.

Segment Reporting

Our primary business is the ownership and operation of neighborhood and community shopping centers. We do not distinguish or group our operations on a geographical basis, or any other basis, when measuring performance. Accordingly, we have one operating segment, which also serves as our reportable segment for disclosure purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").
