Item 1.        Business
General
Harley-Davidson Motor Company was founded in 1903. Harley-Davidson, Inc. was incorporated in 1981, at which time it purchased the Harley-Davidson® motorcycle business from AMF Incorporated in a management buyout. In 1986, Harley-Davidson, Inc. became publicly held. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the “Company” include Harley-Davidson, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries. Harley-Davidson, Inc. is the parent company for the groups of companies doing business as Harley-Davidson Motor Company (HDMC) and Harley-Davidson Financial Services (HDFS). The Company has two reportable segments: the Motorcycles and Related Products (Motorcycles) segment and the Financial Services segment. 
Strategy
The Company's long-term strategy, announced in 2017, is to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders globally and includes the following 2027 objectives:

• | Build two million new Harley-Davidson riders in the U.S.


• | Grow the Harley-Davidson international business to 50 percent of its total annual volume


• | Launch 100 new, high-impact Harley-Davidson motorcycles


• | Deliver superior return on invested capital for HDMC that falls within the top quartile of the S&P 500


• | Grow the business without growing its environmental impact

On July 30, 2018, the Company disclosed its “More Roads to Harley-Davidson” plan to accelerate the Company's strategy to build the next generation of riders globally. The More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan through 2022 includes three growth catalysts: 

• | New products - keep current riders engaged and inspire new riders by extending heavyweight leadership and expanding into new markets and segments


• | Broader access - meet customers where they are and how they want to engage with a multi-channel retail experience


• | Stronger dealers - drive a performance framework to improve dealer financial strength and the Harley-Davidson customer experience

Motorcycles and Related Products Segment
The Motorcycles segment consists of HDMC, which designs, manufactures and sells at wholesale on-road Harley-Davidson motorcycles as well as motorcycle parts, accessories, general merchandise and related services. The Company conducts business on a global basis, with sales in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific.

The following table includes Motorcycles segment revenue by product line as a percent of total revenue for the last three fiscal years(a):

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Motorcycles | 78.1 | % | | 76.6 | % | 76.9 | %
Parts & Accessories | 15.2 | % | | 16.3 | % | 15.9 | %
General Merchandise | 4.9 | % | | 5.3 | % | 5.4 | %
Licensing | 0.8 | % | | 0.8 | % | 0.8 | %
Other | 1.0 | % | | 1.0 | % | 1.0 | %
 | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %


(a) | In connection with the adoption of ASU 2014-09, the Company has changed its presentation of disaggregated Motorcycles segment revenue and the prior period has been recast to reflect the new presentation.

Motorcycles - The Company's current Harley-Davidson motorcycle offerings include cruiser and touring models that feature unique styling, innovative design, distinctive sound, and superior quality with the ability to customize. These Harley-Davidson motorcycles generally have engines with displacements that are greater than 601cc's, up to a maximum displacement of approximately 1900cc's. 
The total on-road motorcycle market is comprised of the following segments:

• | Cruiser (emphasizes styling and owner customization);


• | Touring (emphasizes rider comfort and load capacity and incorporates features such as fairings and luggage compartments);


• | Standard (a basic motorcycle which usually features upright seating for one or two passengers);


• | Sportbike (incorporates racing technology, aerodynamic styling, low handlebars with a “sport” riding position and high performance tires); and


• | Dual (designed with the capability for use on public roads as well as for some off-highway recreational use).

The Company's current lineup of motorcycles competes primarily in the cruiser and touring segments of the market. Competition in the segments of the motorcycle market in which the Company currently competes is based upon a number of factors including product capabilities and features, styling, price, quality, reliability, warranty, availability of financing, and quality of the dealer network that sells the product. The Company believes its motorcycles continue to generally command a premium price at retail relative to competitors’ motorcycles. The Company emphasizes remarkable styling, customization, innovation, sound, quality and reliability in its products and generally offers a two-year warranty for its motorcycles. The Company considers the availability of a line of motorcycle parts & accessories and general merchandise, the availability of financing through HDFS and its global network of independent dealers to be competitive advantages.
Under the More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan, the Company intends to introduce new products including electric motorcycles; a new middle-weight platform of motorcycles that includes adventure touring, custom and streetfighter models with engine displacements ranging from 500cc's to 1250cc's; and smaller displacement motorcycles for emerging markets. The Company plans to introduce these new motorcycles between 2019 and 2022, starting with a new electric motorcycle, LiveWireTM, in the second half of 2019.
Motorcycle Industry Data - In 2018, the U.S. and European markets accounted for approximately 76% of the total annual independent dealer retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles. The most significant other markets for the Company, based on the Company's 2018 retail sales data, were Japan, Australia, and Canada. 
 In the U.S., the 601+cc portion of the motorcycle market represented approximately 77% of the total motorcycle market in 2018, based on new units registered. The cruiser and touring segments accounted for approximately 70% of the U.S. 601+cc market in 2018. Harley-Davidson has been the historical market share leader in the U.S. 601+cc portion of the motorcycle market (U.S. industry data source: Motorcycle Industry Council).

Parts & Accessories (P&A) and General Merchandise – The Company offers a complete line of Harley-Davidson P&A and General Merchandise. P&A products are comprised of replacement parts (Genuine Motor Parts) and mechanical and cosmetic accessories (Genuine Motor Accessories). General Merchandise includes MotorClothes® apparel and riding gear.
Licensing – The Company creates an awareness of the Harley-Davidson brand among its customers and the non-riding public by licensing the name “Harley-Davidson” and other trademarks owned by the Company for use on a wide range of products for enthusiasts and others. 
Patents and Trademarks – The Company strategically manages its portfolio of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property.
5

The Company and its subsidiaries own, and continue to obtain, patent rights that relate to its motorcycles and related products and processes for their production. Certain technology-related intellectual property is also protected, where appropriate, by license agreements, confidentiality agreements or other agreements with suppliers, employees and other third parties. The Company diligently protects its intellectual property, including patents and trade secrets, and its rights to innovative and proprietary technology and designs. This protection, including enforcement, is important as the Company moves forward with investments in new products, designs and technologies. While the Company believes patents are important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset, the success of the business is not dependent on any one patent or group of patents. The Company’s active patent portfolio has an average age for patents of approximately seven years. A patent review committee manages the patent strategy and portfolio of the Company.
Trademarks are important to the Company’s motorcycle business and licensing activities. The Company has a vigorous worldwide program of trademark registration and enforcement to maintain and strengthen the value of the trademarks and prevent the unauthorized use of those trademarks. The HARLEY-DAVIDSON trademark and the Bar and Shield trademark are each highly recognizable to the public and are very valuable assets. Additionally, the Company uses numerous other trademarks, trade names and logos which are registered worldwide. The following are among the Company’s trademarks: HARLEY-DAVIDSON, H-D, HARLEY, the Bar & Shield Logo, MOTORCLOTHES, the MotorClothes Logo, the Willie G Skull Logo, HARLEY OWNERS GROUP, H.O.G., the H.O.G. Logo, SOFTAIL and SPORTSTER. The HARLEY-DAVIDSON trademark has been used since 1903 and the Bar and Shield trademark since at least 1910. Substantially all of the Company’s trademarks are owned by H-D U.S.A., LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, which also manages the Company’s global trademark strategy and portfolio.
Marketing and Customer Experiences – The Company’s products are marketed to retail customers worldwide primarily through digital and experiential activities as well as through more traditional promotional and advertising activities. Additionally, the Company's independent dealers engage in a wide range of local marketing and experiential activities in part supported by cooperative programs with the Company.
Customer experiences have traditionally been at the center of much of the Company’s marketing. To attract customers and achieve its goals, the Company participates in motorcycle rallies and special motorcycle events around the world, racing activities, music festivals, sports events and other special events.
The Harley Owners Group (H.O.G.®) promotes Harley-Davidson products and the related lifestyle and sponsors motorcycle events, including rallies and rides for Harley-Davidson motorcycle enthusiasts throughout the world.
The Company's Harley-Davidson® Riding Academy offers a series of rider education experiences that provide both new and experienced riders with deeper engagement in the sport of motorcycling by teaching basic and advanced motorcycling skills and knowledge. The courses are conducted by a network of participating Harley-Davidson dealerships in the U.S., China, Mexico and Colombia, enabling students to experience the Harley-Davidson lifestyle, environment, people and products as they learn.
Through the Company's agreement with EagleRider, riders in the U.S. can rent Harley-Davidson motorcycles and participate in motorcycle tours. EagleRider is the exclusive provider of Harley-Davidson touring and cruiser motorcycle rentals and has locations throughout the U.S., including at select Harley-Davidson dealerships. Outside the U.S., riders can rent Harley-Davidson motorcycles from participating dealers through the Company's Authorized Rental Program and participate in tours through the Company's Harley-Davidson Authorized Tours Program.
The Company's Harley-Davidson Museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin is a unique destination that the Company believes builds and strengthens bonds between riders and Harley-Davidson and enhances the Harley-Davidson brand among the public at large. 
Distribution – The Company’s products are retailed primarily through a network of independent dealers, of which the majority sell Harley-Davidson motorcycles exclusively. These dealerships stock and sell the Company’s motorcycles, P&A, general merchandise and licensed products, and perform service on Harley-Davidson motorcycles. The Company believes the quality retail experience that its independent dealers provide is a differentiating and strategic advantage for the Company.
6

The Company distributes its motorcycles and related products to a network of independent dealers located in approximately 100 countries worldwide. The following table includes the number of worldwide Harley-Davidson independent dealerships by geographic location as of December 31, 2018:

 | United States | Canada | | Latin America | EMEA | Asia Pacific | | Total
Dealerships | 691 | | 69 | | 64 | | 412 | | 299 | 1,535

P&A, general merchandise and licensed products are also retailed through eCommerce channels in certain markets. In the U.S., the Company operates an eCommerce site that offers products sold through participating authorized U.S. Harley-Davidson dealers and also sells directly to consumers through a well-known third-party eCommerce site. The Company also utilizes third-party eCommerce sites in select international markets.
Retail Customer and Dealer Financing – The Company believes that HDFS, as well as other third-party financial institutions, provide access to financing for Harley-Davidson dealers and their retail customers. HDFS provides financing to Harley-Davidson independent dealers and retail customers of independent dealers in the U.S. and Canada. The Company’s independent dealers and their retail customers in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America are not directly financed by HDFS, but have access to financing through other established financial services companies, some of which have licensing or branding agreements with HDFS.
Seasonality – The timing of retail sales made by the Company’s independent dealers tracks closely with regional riding seasons. The seasonality of the Company’s wholesale motorcycle shipments primarily correlates with the timing of retail sales. The Company utilizes flexible or surge manufacturing capabilities to help align the production and wholesale shipment of motorcycles with the retail selling season. This provides the Company the ability to reduce the impact of seasonality on inventory levels in the U.S. and Canada. In EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America, the Company utilizes a distribution process whereby Company-owned inventory is maintained locally at a level sufficient to fulfill dealer orders as needed. 
Motorcycle Manufacturing – The Company has a flexible manufacturing process designed to help ensure it is well-positioned to meet customer demand in a timely and cost-effective manner.(1) This flexible or surge manufacturing capability allows the Company to increase the production of motorcycles ahead of and during the peak retail selling season to more closely correlate the timing of production and wholesale shipments to the retail selling season. It also allows the Company to respond to the desired model mix to meet customer demand.
The majority of the Company's motorcycles are manufactured at facilities located in the U.S. The Company's U.S. manufacturing facilities supply the U.S. market as well as certain international markets. Additionally, the Company operates facilities in Thailand, Brazil, India and Australia. The Company began producing at its new facility in Thailand in 2018, which currently manufactures motorcycles for certain Asian markets. In Brazil, the Company operates a Complete Knock Down (CKD) assembly facility, which assembles motorcycles sold in Brazil from component kits sourced from the Company’s U.S. plants and suppliers. In India, the Company operates a manufacturing facility that includes both CKD assembly of certain motorcycles for sale in India and production of the Company’s Street 750® motorcycles for distribution to markets outside of North America. Like its U.S. manufacturing facilities, the Company’s Thailand, Brazil and India operations are focused on driving world-class performance. The motorcycles assembled at the Company's international facilities have the same authentic look, sound, feel and quality of a motorcycle manufactured by the Company's U.S. facilities. These international facilities enable the Company to be close to the customer, provide quality products at a competitive price and grow its overall international business. In early 2019, the Company will cease operation of its manufacturing facility in Australia, which had produced a portion of its wheels for its motorcycles. These wheels will be sourced from other current suppliers. 
Raw Materials and Purchased Components – The Company continues to establish and reinforce long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with its suppliers. Through these collaborative relationships, the Company gains access to technical and commercial resources for application directly to product design, development and manufacturing initiatives. In addition, through a continued focus on collaboration and strong supplier relationships, the Company believes it will be positioned to achieve strategic objectives and deliver cost and quality improvements over the long-term.(1)
The Company's principal raw materials that are purchased include steel and aluminum castings, forgings, steel sheet and bar. The Company also purchases certain motorcycle components including, but not limited to, electronic fuel injection systems, batteries, tires, seats, electrical components, instruments and wheels. The Company closely monitors the overall viability of its supply base. At this time, the Company does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining raw materials or components.(1)
Regulation – International, federal, state and local authorities have various environmental control requirements relating to air, water and noise that affect the business and operations of the Company. The Company strives to ensure that its facilities and products comply with all applicable environmental regulations and standards.
7

The Company’s motorcycles and certain other products that are sold in the United States are subject to certification by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) for compliance with applicable emissions and noise standards. Certain Harley-Davidson products are designed to comply with EPA and CARB standards and the Company believes it will comply with future requirements when they go into effect.(1) Additionally, certain of the Company’s products must comply with the motorcycle emissions, noise and safety standards of Canada, the European Union, Japan, Brazil and certain other foreign markets where they are sold, and the Company believes its products currently comply with those standards. Because the Company expects that environmental standards will become more stringent over time, the Company will continue to incur research, development and production costs in this area for the foreseeable future.(1)
The Company, as a manufacturer of motorcycle products, is subject to the U.S. National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, which is administered by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Company has certified to NHTSA that certain of its motorcycle products comply fully with all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and related regulations. The Company has from time to time initiated certain voluntary recalls. During the last three years, the Company has accrued $110.0 million associated with 9 voluntary recalls related to Harley-Davidson motorcycles. 
Employees – As of December 31, 2018, the Motorcycles segment had approximately 5,300 employees. 
Approximately 2,200 unionized employees at the U.S. manufacturing facilities are represented as follows:

• | York, Pennsylvania - International Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers (IAM), collective bargaining agreement will expire on October 15, 2022


• | Kansas City, Missouri - United Steelworkers of America (USW) and IAM, collective bargaining agreement will expire on December 31, 2019


• | Milwaukee, Wisconsin - USW and IAM, collective bargaining agreements will expire on March 31, 2019


• | Tomahawk, Wisconsin - USW, collective bargaining agreement will expire on March 31, 2019

Financial Services Segment
The Financial Services segment consists of HDFS which is engaged in the business of financing and servicing wholesale inventory receivables and retail consumer loans, primarily for the purchase of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. HDFS also works with certain unaffiliated insurance companies to provide motorcycle insurance and protection products to motorcycle owners. HDFS conducts business principally in the U.S. and Canada. The Company’s independent dealers and their retail customers in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America are not financed by HDFS, but have access to financing through other third-party financial institutions, some of which have licensing or branding agreements with the Company or HDFS.
Wholesale Financial Services – HDFS provides wholesale financial services to Harley-Davidson dealers, including floorplan and open account financing of motorcycles and motorcycle parts and accessories. HDFS offers wholesale financial services to Harley-Davidson dealers in the United States and Canada, and during 2018, all of such dealers utilized those services at some point during the year.
Retail Financial Services – HDFS provides retail financing to consumers, consisting primarily of installment lending for the purchase of new and used Harley-Davidson motorcycles. HDFS’ retail financial services are available through most Harley-Davidson dealerships in the United States and Canada.
Insurance Services – HDFS works with certain unaffiliated insurance companies which offer point-of-sale protection products through most Harley-Davidson dealers in both the U.S. and Canada, including motorcycle insurance, extended service contracts and motorcycle maintenance protection. HDFS also direct-markets motorcycle insurance and extended service contracts to owners of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. In addition, HDFS markets a comprehensive package of business insurance coverages and services to owners of Harley-Davidson dealerships.
Licensing – HDFS has licensing arrangements with third-party financial institutions that issue credit cards bearing the Harley-Davidson brand in U.S. and international markets. Internationally, HDFS licenses the Harley-Davidson brand to local third-party financial institutions that offer products to the Company’s retail customers such as financing and insurance. 
Funding – The Company believes a diversified and cost-effective funding strategy is important to meet HDFS’ goal of providing credit while delivering appropriate returns and profitability. Financial Services operations have been funded with unsecured debt, unsecured commercial paper, asset-backed commercial paper conduit facilities, committed unsecured bank facilities and asset-backed securitizations. 
Competition – The Company regards its ability to offer a package of wholesale and retail financial services in the U.S. and Canada as a significant competitive advantage. Competitors in the financial services industry compete for business based 
8

largely on price and, to a lesser extent, service. HDFS competes on convenience, service, brand association, dealer relations, industry experience, terms and price.
In the United States, HDFS financed 64.9% of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles retailed by independent dealers during 2018, compared to 61.2% in 2017. In Canada, HDFS financed 39.9% of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles retailed by independent dealers during 2018, compared to 41.9% in 2017. Competitors for retail motorcycle finance business are primarily banks, credit unions and other financial institutions. In the motorcycle insurance business, competition primarily comes from national insurance companies and from insurance agencies serving local or regional markets. For insurance-related products such as extended service contracts, HDFS faces competition from certain regional and national industry participants as well as dealer in-house programs. Competition for the wholesale motorcycle finance business primarily consists of banks and other financial institutions providing wholesale financing to Harley-Davidson dealers in their local markets.
Trademarks – HDFS uses various trademarks and trade names for its financial services and products which are licensed from H-D U.S.A., LLC, including HARLEY-DAVIDSON, H-D and the Bar & Shield logo.
Seasonality – HDFS experiences seasonal variations in retail financing activities based on the timing of regional riding seasons in the U.S. and Canada. In general, from mid-March through August, retail financing volume is greatest. HDFS wholesale financing volume is affected by inventory levels at Harley-Davidson dealers. Dealers generally have higher inventory in the first half of the year. As a result, outstanding wholesale finance receivables are generally higher during the same period. 
Regulation – Operations of HDFS (both U.S. and foreign) are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by state and federal administrative agencies and various foreign governmental authorities. Many of the requirements imposed by such entities are in place to provide consumer protection as it pertains to the selling and servicing of financial products and services. Therefore, HDFS operations may be subject to limitations imposed by regulations, laws and judicial and/or administrative decisions. In the U.S. for example, applicable laws include the federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act.
Depending on the specific facts and circumstances involved, non-compliance with these laws may result in consequences such as limiting the ability of HDFS to collect all or part of the principal or interest on applicable loans, entitling the borrower to rescind the loan or to obtain a refund of amounts previously paid, or could subject HDFS to the payment of damages or penalties and administrative sanctions, including “cease and desist” orders, and could limit the number of loans eligible for HDFS securitization programs.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act granted the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the Bureau) significant supervisory, enforcement, and rule-making authority in the area of consumer financial products and services. Certain Bureau actions and regulations will directly impact HDFS and its operations. For example, the Bureau has supervisory authority over non-bank larger participants in the vehicle financing market, which includes a non-bank subsidiary of HDFS.
Such regulatory requirements and associated supervision also could limit the discretion of HDFS in operating its business. Noncompliance with applicable statutes or regulations could result in the suspension or revocation of any charter, license or registration at issue, as well as the imposition of civil fines, criminal penalties and administrative sanctions.
A subsidiary of HDFS, Eaglemark Savings Bank (ESB), is a Nevada state thrift chartered as an Industrial Loan Company (ILC). The activities of this subsidiary are governed by federal laws and regulations as well as State of Nevada banking laws, and are subject to examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Nevada state bank examiners. ESB originates retail loans and sells the loans to a non-banking subsidiary of HDFS. This process allows HDFS to offer retail products with many common characteristics across the United States and to similarly service loans to U.S. retail customers.
Employees – As of December 31, 2018, the Financial Services segment had approximately 600 employees.
