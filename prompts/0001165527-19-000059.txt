HISTORY
 
Free Flow, Inc. (the "Company" or "Free Flow") was incorporated on October 28, 2011 under the laws of State of Delaware to enter the green energy industry. The Company began with the idea of developing swimming pool solar pump system to create a blend of green energy harvesting while maintaining the present system. Having received firm enquiries from overseas farmers, Free Flow began with focus on the sale of solar panels to the agriculture sector, providing alternate means of electricity to operate pumps for water wells in India and Pakistan. In August 2014 the Company contracted to acquire as its subsidiary a special purpose entity in India but the contract was not effectuated due to the Sellers’ inability to comply with the terms of the contract, viz-a-viz to provide Audited Financial statements of the entity being acquired.
 
In February 2015, the company incorporated a subsidiary, Promedaff, Inc. and purchased a skin care product line and formulations for $2,000,000 against a promissory note.

COMPANY OVERVIEW
 
Since the new management took over the company’s control on March 13, 2014, from S. Douglas Henderson, former CEO, it has remained focused in developing the solar energy business along with pharmaceutical (skin care product line), neither one of which had produced any revenues. However, the management continued its efforts to deploy “Solar Well” operation in India and Pakistan, due to economic instability no contract could be concluded.
 
Concurrent to the above efforts, a few prospects had shown keen interest in promotion of HYGIENiQ to the automotive industry. Approx.35% of the inventory was sold and paid for during the first quarter of 2016.
 
Upon taking over, the Company appointed Ferdinando (Fred) Ferrara as a Director and Sabir Saleem as CEO.  There was no family relationship or other relationship between the Seller and the Purchaser.
