 Item 1.  Business.
 Overview
 Global Power Equipment Group Inc. was incorporated in 2001 under the laws of the State of Delaware and became the successor to GEEG Holdings, LLC, which was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 1998. Effective June 29, 2018, Global Power Equipment Group Inc. changed its name to Williams Industrial Services Group Inc. (together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, “Williams,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our,” unless the context indicates otherwise) to better align its name with the Williams business (as defined below), and our stock now trades on the OTCQX® Best Market (the “OTCQX”) under the ticker symbol “WLMS.” Williams has been safely helping plant owners and operators enhance asset value for more than 50 years. We provide a broad range of construction, maintenance and support services to customers in energy, power and industrial end markets. Our mission is to be the preferred provider of construction, maintenance, and specialty services through commitment to superior safety performance, focus on innovation, and dedication to delivering unsurpassed value to our customers. Our Transformation
 We completed the transformation of our Company in 2018. Beginning in 2016, we shifted our strategy to become a preferred provider of construction, maintenance and specialty services, to exit all product manufacturing businesses and to use the proceeds from the sales to reduce and restructure our term debt. To effect this change, in the third quarter of 2017, we made the decision to exit and sell substantially all of the operating assets and liabilities of our Mechanical Solutions segment, which

we completed in the fourth quarter of 2017, as described below. Additionally, we made the decision to exit and sell our Electrical Solutions segment (which was comprised solely of Koontz-Wagner, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) in the fourth quarter of 2017. We determined that these two segments met the definition of discontinued operations, and, as a result, they (including TOG Manufacturing Company, Inc. and TOG Holdings, Inc., which were sold in July 2016) have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments were the only components of the business that qualified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise specified, the financial information and discussion in this Form 10-K are based on our continuing operations (previously referred to as our Services segment); they exclude any results of our discontinued operations. Please refer to “Note 4—Changes in Business” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information.
 In spite of our efforts, which included retaining financial advisors to sell all or part of Koontz-Wagner’s operations, inside or outside of a federal bankruptcy or state court proceeding (including Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”)), the proposed disposition did not progress as planned due, primarily, to the absence of viable bids in the sale process, the inability of Koontz-Wagner to fund its ongoing operations or obtain financing to do so, and Koontz-Wagner’s deteriorating financial performance. As a result, on July 11, 2018, Koontz-Wagner filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. The filing was for Koontz-Wagner only, not for the Company as a whole, and was completely separate and distinct from the Williams business and operations.
 On October 11, 2017, we sold substantially all of the operating assets and liabilities of our Mechanical Solutions segment and used a portion of the $40.9 million net proceeds to pay down $34.0 million of our outstanding debt and related fees, including full repayment of the first-out loan, provided for by the first amendment to the Initial Centre Lane Facility (as defined below) for an additional aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million (the “First-Out Loan”) and the upfront fee on the 4.5-year senior secured term loan facility, entered into June 16, 2017, with an affiliate of Centre Lane as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and the other Lenders from time to time party thereto (as amended, the “Initial Centre Lane Facility”). Additionally, on October 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our manufacturing facility in Mexico and auctioned the remaining production equipment and other assets for net proceeds of $3.6 million, of which $1.9 million was used to reduce the principal amount of the Initial Centre Lane Facility. The remaining proceeds from such sales were used to fund working capital requirements.
 Prior to our strategic shift, and in an effort to address our high level of debt, in January 2017, we sold the stock of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Hetsco Holdings, Inc. and Hetsco, Inc. (collectively, “Hetsco”), for $23.2 million in cash, inclusive of working capital adjustments. After transaction costs and an escrow withholding of $1.5 million, the net proceeds of $20.2 million were used to reduce debt. Hetsco provided brazed aluminum heat exchanger repair and maintenance and safety services to the industrial gas, liquefied natural gas and petrochemical industries. Following the sale of Hetsco, we no longer engage in these services and no longer maintain intellectual property related to the Hetsco trade name or brand. Unless otherwise specified, information contained in this report is as of December 31, 2018 and reflects the sale of Hetsco.
 Our Strategy for Growth
 As a result of the sale of our Mechanical Solutions segment and the bankruptcy of Koontz-Wagner, our chief operating decision maker reviews financial information presented on a company-wide basis. Therefore, as of December 31, 2018, we concluded that we continue to have a single reporting segment which is comprised of Williams Industrial Services Group, LLC (collectively with Williams Plant Services, LLC, Williams Specialty Services, LLC and Williams Industrial Services, LLC, the “Williams business”), as we did as of December 31, 2017. 
 Our transformation strategy has been focused on improving operations, strengthening our core competencies, selling non-core assets, aggressively managing working capital and reducing costs in order to improve liquidity and reduce debt. As a result, we have successfully transformed the organization into a services-only business that provides a broad range of construction, maintenance and support services to customers in energy, power and industrial end markets. We expect to leverage the strength of the Williams brand, capitalize on our industry knowledge and customer relationships and safely provide timely, reliable services for our customers to grow revenue. 
 In 2018, we implemented major cost reduction initiatives to reduce our overhead costs, and we restructured and consolidated our corporate functions. We expect this to increase our operating leverage and expand net operating margins as we pursue new revenue opportunities. Our operations are based on our effectiveness in using estimating and engineering technologies, deploying rigorous project management techniques, initiating various process improvement projects and employing experienced industry-recognized sales professionals. We believe we are well positioned to grow our business in 2019 and beyond, and to realize the operating leverage our restructuring has created.

 Our Business
 We provide a comprehensive range of construction, maintenance and support services to customers in energy, power and industrial end markets. We provide these services both on a constant presence basis and for discrete projects. The services we provide are designed to improve or sustain operating efficiencies and extend the useful lives of process equipment. 
 Our services include the following:

· | Plant Maintenance, Modification and Construction. We perform a full range of critical services, including maintenance, modification, repair and other capital project services designed to extend life cycles regarding nuclear, paper, fossil fuel, industrial gas, hydro power, natural gas, municipal water and wastewater and other facilities for customers in energy, power and industrial end markets. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Painting and Coatings. We perform cleaning, surface preparation, coatings application, quality control and inspection testing on major coating projects for nuclear and fossil fuel power plants, industrial facilities and petrochemical plants. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Insulation. We provide a variety of industrial insulation services, primarily in power generation installations. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Asbestos and Lead Abatement. We provide abatement services for the removal of asbestos and heavy metal based coatings such as lead paint. We do not take ownership of hazardous materials and do not assume responsibility for the liability associated with the materials other than for our actions meeting applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Roofing Systems. We replace, repair and upgrade industrial facility roofing systems, primarily at pulp and paper manufacturing facilities and nuclear power plant locations. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Oil and Gas Modifications and Construction. We have periodically executed select oil and gas projects for many years, but we have recently hired personnel with specific oil and gas experience to aggressively pursue that market full-time. We are targeting several customers and specific projects and have established offices in key Gulf Coast cities. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Analog to Digital Conversions. Conversion of analog control systems to digital controls improves reliability and accuracy in plant systems, and often allows facilities to run at higher levels. As a result, it is a capital improvement that utilities and industries are investing in at several operating facilities. We successfully completed several digital upgrades on multiple units for two of our customers, and we are targeting several more. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Canada Nuclear. Two power companies in Canada have announced their intention to extend the lives of several of their operating nuclear units and established large capital improvement budgets to that end. We believe that the work required for such improvements is similar to upgrades completed for nuclear plants in the U.S. Therefore, we commenced a strategic initiative to pursue new maintenance, modification and construction opportunities in Canada. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Nuclear Decommissioning. Several U.S. nuclear stations have already been shut down, and several more shutdowns are planned. After shutdown, the plants must be decommissioned. This process takes many years. We are working with a supplier on one of the sites being decommissioned and are targeting the decommissioning market as it grows. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We provide these services throughout the U.S., primarily on a direct hire basis, with experienced craft laborers who are directed and managed by an experienced team of supervisors and project managers across our network. We also act in a general contracting capacity where we manage multiple subcontractors and, in other cases, we are retained as a subcontractor on a project. Our flexible staffing model enables us to meet seasonal and outage demand without being restricted by internal capacity limitations, thereby minimizing our fixed costs.
 In 2018, we contracted for 84% of our revenue on cost-plus contracts that provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit. The remaining 16% of our revenue was generated from fixed-price contracts.

 We bid against other contractors based on customer specifications. Fixed-price contracts present certain inherent risks, including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Alternatively, because of efficiencies that may be realized during the contract term, fixed-price contracts may offer greater profit potential than cost-plus contracts.
 Market Overview
 Power Generation Market and the Industrial Services Industry.  The U.S. industrial services industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, broadly defined as routine modification, maintenance and technical services provided to industrial facilities ranging from manufacturing facilities to power generation plants. The industry continues to benefit from a shift towards outsourcing as plant operators seek to alleviate financial constraints, reduce labor costs, increase labor utilization and productivity, and eliminate operational redundancies.
 We expect that power industry demand for these services will be driven by the following factors in the future:

· | Aging Power Generation Infrastructure Increases Demand for Plant Maintenance and Decommissioning Services. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (the “EIA”), more than half of the electrical generating capacity in the U.S. was placed in service before 1990. Coupled with the relatively limited number of large-scale power generation facilities being constructed in the U.S., the efforts to maintain older plants of all types and to take advantage of newer and more efficient technologies at existing sites result in opportunities for companies providing services to plant operators. The low price of natural gas is driving demand for new, upgraded and replacement electric generation capacity toward combined cycle gas powered plants, which are more economical to run. With natural gas pricing expected to remain low, this is also driving the conversions of simple cycle plants to combined cycle technology. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Further, approximately 90 nuclear reactors that have been in operation in the U.S. for more than 30 years require extensive ongoing engineering and maintenance services to support operations and improve performance. Nuclear power plants in the U.S. are subject to a rigorous program of U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) oversight, inspection, preventive and corrective maintenance, equipment replacement and equipment testing. Nuclear power plants are required to go offline to refuel at intervals of no more than 24 months and to perform condition monitoring and preventive maintenance during every refueling outage. Initially, commercial nuclear power plants in the U.S. were licensed to operate for 40 years, reflecting the amortization period generally used by electric utility companies for large capital investments. As of December 31, 2016, the NRC had extended the licenses of approximately 85 reactors. In all, about 90 reactors are expected to operate for up to 60 years, with owners undertaking an increase in modification, maintenance and construction capital projects to upgrade their facilities. Decommissioning work on retired nuclear reactors also provides future opportunities for growth.

· | North America Infrastructure Growth. Record levels of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid production have accelerated new build and expansion of pipeline and related infrastructure to reduce transportation bottlenecks and bring more petroleum products to key markets. The value proposition of low cost shale resources is altering the landscape for pipelines, terminals, refineries and power generation assets. Infrastructure growth and modifications provide opportunities for us to assist in the construction and maintenance of these facilities. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Nuclear Power Plant Services and New Nuclear Reactor Construction. We are one of a limited number of companies qualified to perform comprehensive services in U.S. nuclear power plants under rules issued by the NRC. We are one of the few contractors with a qualified and audited Nuclear Quality Assurance (“NQA-1”) Program, which is required to perform contract services at the new build reactors. Under these rules, owners of nuclear facilities must qualify contractors by requiring the contractors to demonstrate that they will comply with NRC regulations on quality assurance, reporting of safety issues, security and control of personnel access and conduct. On the majority of our maintenance and project work, we directly hire the labor and provide the management and supervision to perform the work directly for the owner. In some cases, we act as a general contractor and subcontract portions of the work or, alternatively, subcontract our services to full scope engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) firms or general contractor firms. We maintain good relationships with the utilities, the EPC firms, the general contractor firms and relevant engineering firms.

· | Standby and Distributed Power Generation. Unlike central station generation, standby and distributed power generation equipment can sit on either side of the utility meter and may be owned by a utility, a customer or a third party. Peak energy demand requirements and higher costs, as well as transmission and distribution

infrastructure limits, are driving investment into this space. The growth in industries with high power demand and sensitivity to power supply instability, such as datacenters, medical centers, universities and remotely located industrial loads, are straining the traditional power infrastructure. The electric power needs for these markets have been served by small-scale utility-owned diesel or gas engine generators strategically located to support distributed system operations. The power supply is trending toward larger (greater than 1,000 kilowatts) diesel engine generator systems and expanding into alternative energy assets.

  Customers, Marketing and Seasonality
 Our customers include major private and government-owned utilities throughout the U.S. and in Ontario, Canada, as well as leaders in the U.S. pulp and paper and industrial sectors. We market our services using dedicated sales and marketing personnel as well as our experienced on-site operations personnel. We use our safety and service track record with long-term renewable contracts to expand our services and supplement existing contracts with small- to medium-sized capital projects. Our sales initiatives directly seek to apply operational strengths to specific facilities within our targeted industries and customers throughout the U.S. and in Ontario, Canada. We are impacted by seasonality, resulting in fluctuations in revenue and gross profit during our fiscal year. Generally, this is driven by our customers’ schedule of planned outages.
 We depend on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of any of those customers would have a material adverse effect on our business. For a listing of our major customers, please refer to “Note 15—Major Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
 Quality Capabilities and Safety Performance
 Through our NQA-1 Program and other programs, we provide training, certifications and ongoing safety monitoring to all of our employees working at nuclear sites. We are one of a limited number of companies qualified to work anywhere in a U.S. nuclear facility and have been one of the leading providers of coatings at U.S. nuclear facilities for almost 40 years. In addition, we are one of only a few contractors with the qualified and audited NQA-1 Program that is required to perform contract services at new build reactors. For over 13 years, we have maintained a safety record in the top quartile of the industry, benefiting both us and our customers. We also maintain a broad range of professional certifications and memberships in national organizations relevant to the performance of many of the specialized services we provide. Materials and Suppliers
 The markets for most of the materials we use are served by a large number of suppliers, and we believe that we can obtain required materials from more than one supplier.  Competition
 Our competitors vary depending on plant geography and the scope of services to be rendered. Several national service providers, which are significantly larger and have significantly greater financial resources than we do, will often compete for larger maintenance and capital project opportunities that become available. These service providers include, among others, Allied Power, APTIM Corp., BHI Energy and Day & Zimmermann. Additionally, smaller contractors that operate on a regional basis often compete for smaller opportunities associated with open shop labor sources. We compete based on reputation, safety, price, service, quality and our breadth of service capabilities. We believe our strong reputation, longevity in the industry, project management capabilities, including service diversity, long-term customer relationships, safety record and performance, and our success at identifying and retaining qualified personnel differentiate us from our competitors. We also believe that the fact that we maintain a presence at several of our customers’ sites is a competitive advantage because it provides us with an intimate understanding of these facilities, which allows us to better identify our customers’ service needs. Specific to our customers that operate nuclear power plants, barriers to entry include the requirement to hold and maintain the rigorous NRC qualifications and safety standards. Insurance
 We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations; however, we remain exposed to potential losses because we are subject to deductibles, coverage limits and self-insured retentions.

 Typically, our contracts require us to indemnify our customers for third party injury, damage or loss arising from the performance of our services and provide for warranties for materials and workmanship. We may also be required to name the customer as an additional insured up to the limits of insurance available, or we may be required to purchase special insurance policies for specific customers. We maintain performance and payment bonding lines to support our business. In rare cases we may provide a letter of credit in lieu of a bond to satisfy performance and financial guarantees on a project.
 We require all subcontractors working with us at a customer’s location to indemnify us and our customers and name us as an additional insured for activities arising out of such subcontractors’ work. We also require certain subcontractors to provide additional insurance policies, including surety bonds in favor of us, to secure such subcontractors’ work or as required by contract. It is possible that our insurance and the additional insurance coverage provided by our subcontractors will not fully protect us against a valid claim or loss under the contracts with our customers. 
 Intellectual Property
 As of December 31, 2018, we used the Williams trade name and its logo. This trade name and logo are the property of Williams. Product names and company programs appearing throughout this Form 10-K are trademarks of Williams. This Form 10-K also may refer to brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies and organizations, and those brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names are the property of their respective owners. In January 2017, we sold Hetsco, which maintained some of the intellectual property assets described.  Compliance with Government Regulations
 We are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental, occupational health and nuclear regulatory laws applicable in the U.S and Canada. We also purchase materials and equipment from third parties and engage subcontractors who are also subject to these laws and regulations. Below is a summary of certain laws and regulations applicable to our business.
· | Environmental. We are subject to extensive and changing environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and Canada. These laws and regulations relate primarily to air and water pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous materials. We are exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release, spill, exposure or other accident involving such pollutants, substances or hazardous materials. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Health and Safety Regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state and international laws. Regulations promulgated by these agencies require employers and independent contractors who perform construction services, including electrical and repair and maintenance, to implement work practices, medical surveillance systems and personnel protection programs to protect employees from workplace hazards and exposure to hazardous chemicals and materials. In recognition of the potential for accidents within various scopes of work, these agencies have enacted very strict and comprehensive safety regulations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NRC. Owners of nuclear power plants are licensed to build, operate and maintain those plants by the NRC. Their license requires that they qualify their suppliers and contractors to ensure that the suppliers and contractors comply with NRC regulations. We must demonstrate to our customers that we comply with NRC regulations related to quality assurance, reporting of safety issues, security and control of personnel access and conduct. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | International Regulations. As a result of our expansion into Canada, we are subject to a variety of legal requirements pertaining to such activities. Our activities may be subject to oversight by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, and we may be subject to additional rules and regulations, including Canada’s Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act, which generally conforms to international conventions and is conceptually similar to the Price-Anderson Act in the U.S. In addition, we may be subject to rules and regulations applying to cross border business, such as international trade and tariff policies, license requirements and requirements relating to toxic substances. Violations of any applicable licensing, tariff and tax reporting requirements or failure to provide certifications relating to toxic substances could result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Furthermore, the failure to comply with U.S. federal, state and local tax requirements, as well as Canadian federal and provincial tax requirements, could lead to the imposition of additional taxes, interest and penalties. Our expansion into Canada, and into any international market, is dependent upon our ability to comply with the regulatory regimes adopted by such jurisdictions. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Department of the Treasury. The Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the imposition of fines and suspension or debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  While we believe that we operate safely and prudently and in material compliance with all environmental, occupational health, nuclear regulatory and other applicable laws, there can be no assurance that accidents will not occur or that we will not incur substantial liability in connection with the operation of our business. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures or material adverse effect on earnings or cash flows as a result of complying with these laws.
 Backlog
 The services we provide are typically carried out under construction contracts, long-term maintenance contracts and master service agreements. Total backlog represents the dollar amount of revenue expected to be recorded in the future for work performed under awarded contracts. Previously we reported backlog as orders from fixed-price contracts plus the amount of revenue we expected to receive in the next twelve-month period from cost-plus contracts, regardless of the remaining life of the cost-plus contract. However, we believe that reporting the total revenue expected under awarded contracts is more representative of our expected future revenue.
 Revenue estimates included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of project accelerations, cancellations or delays due to various factors, including, but not limited to, the customer’s budgetary constraints and adverse weather. These factors can also cause revenue amounts to be realized in different periods and at levels other than those originally projected. Additional work that is not identified under the original contract is added to our backlog when we reach an agreement with the customer as to the scope and pricing of that additional work. Backlog is reduced as work is performed and revenue is recognized, or upon cancellation.
 Backlog is not a measure defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), and our methodology for determining backlog may vary from the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog amounts. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results and projects in our backlog may be cancelled, modified or otherwise altered by our customers.
 The following tables summarize our backlog:

 | December 31,
(in thousands) | 2018 | | 2017
Cost plus | $ | 487,033 | | $ | 291,742
Lump sum | | 14,571 | | | 46,222 
Total | $ | 501,604 | | $ | 337,964

      Backlog as of December 31, 2018 increased significantly from December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a long-term contract for maintenance services during a customer’s nuclear outages, which are scheduled for every other year (on odd numbered years). As of December 31, 2018, $174.1 million, or 34.7%, of the total backlog related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

 | Estimated Conversion Period | | | 
(in thousands) | 2019 | | Thereafter | | Total 
Cost plus | $ | 163,584 | | $ | 323,449 | $ | 487,033
Lump sum | | 9,762 | | | 4,809 | | 14,571 
Total | $ | 173,346 | | $ | 328,258 | $ | 501,604

      For additional discussion of our backlog, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risk Factors Related to Our Operations.”
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 457 full-time employees (excluding temporary staff and craft labor). The number of our employees, including temporary staff and craft labor, fluctuates greatly, depending on the timing and requirements for

craft labor. Many of the craft labor employees are employed through various union agreements. As of December 31, 2018, there were 531 craft labor employees, of which 382 were under collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relationships with our employees, both full-time and temporary, are satisfactory. We are not aware of any circumstances related to our employees that are likely to result in a work stoppage at any of the project sites where we are performing services. In 2017, we sold our Hetsco business and substantially all of the operating assets and liabilities of our Mechanical Solutions segment. In 2018, Koontz-Wagner filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. Combined, these events resulted in a decrease in the number of our full and part-time employees over the last two years.
