Our Technologies
Conventional Pulse Oximetry 
Pulse oximetry enables the noninvasive measurement of the oxygen saturation level of arterial blood (SpO2), which delivers oxygen to the body’s organs and tissues. Pulse oximetry also measures pulse rate (PR), which, when measured by electrocardiogram (ECG), is called heart rate. Pulse oximeters use sensors attached to an extremity, typically the fingertip or certain core body sites. These sensors contain two light-emitting diodes that transmit red and infrared light from one side of the extremity through the tissue to a photodetector on the other side of the extremity. The photodetector in the sensor measures the amount of red and infrared light absorbed by the tissue. A microprocessor then analyzes the changes in light absorption to provide a continuous, real-time measurement of the amount of oxygen in the patient’s arterial blood. Pulse oximeters typically give audio and visual alerts, or alarms, when the patient’s arterial blood oxygen saturation level or pulse rate falls outside of a user-designated range. As a result, clinicians have the opportunity to assess patients who may need immediate treatment to prevent the serious clinical consequences of hypoxemia, or low arterial blood oxygen saturation levels, and hyperoxemia, or high arterial blood oxygen levels.
As one of the most common technologies used in and out of hospitals around the world, pulse oximetry has gained widespread clinical acceptance as a standard patient vital sign measurement because it can give clinicians a warning of possible hypoxemia or hyperoxemia. SpO monitoring of oxygen saturation is critical because hypoxemia can lead to a lack of oxygen in the body’s tissues, which can be toxic and result in organ damage or death. Pulse oximeters are used in a variety of critical care settings, including surgery, recovery rooms, intensive care units (ICUs), emergency departments and general care floors, as well as alternative care settings, such as long-term care facilities, physician offices and the home monitoring of patients with chronic conditions. Clinicians also use pulse oximeters to monitor oxygen saturation in premature babies to ensure that appropriate oxygen saturation levels are maintained.
Conventional pulse oximetry has limitations that can reduce its effectiveness and the quality of patient care. In particular, when using conventional pulse oximetry, oxygen saturation measurements can be distorted by motion artifact, or patient movement, and low perfusion, or low arterial blood flow at the measurement site. Motion artifact can cause conventional pulse oximeters to inaccurately measure the arterial blood oxygen saturation level, due mainly to the effect of movement-induced pulsations of venous blood, which is at a lower oxygen saturation than arterial blood. Low perfusion can also cause conventional pulse oximeters to report inaccurate measurements or, in some cases, no measurement at all. In addition, conventional pulse oximeters cannot distinguish oxygenated hemoglobin from dyshemoglobin, including the most prevalent forms of dyshemoglobins, carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin. As a result, conventional pulse oximeters may report falsely high oxygen levels when these dyshemoglobins are present in the blood. Furthermore, conventional pulse oximetry readings can also be impacted by bright light and electrical interference caused by the presence of electrical surgical equipment. 
The Masimo Difference - Masimo SET® Pulse Oximetry
Masimo SET® was designed to overcome the primary limitations of conventional pulse oximetry by maintaining accuracy in the presence of motion artifact, low perfusion and weak signal-to-noise situations. Our Masimo SET® platform, which became available to U.S. hospitals in 1998, is the basis of our pulse oximetry products, and we believe represented the first significant technological advancement in pulse oximetry since its invention in the early 1970s and introduction in the early 1980s. Masimo SET® utilizes five signal processing algorithms, four of which are proprietary, in parallel to deliver high sensitivity and specificity in the measurement of arterial blood oxygen saturation levels. Sensitivity is the ability to detect true alarms and specificity is the ability to avoid false alarms. One of our proprietary processing algorithms, Discrete Saturation Transform®, separates the signal from noise in real time through the use of adaptive filtering and an iterative sampling technique that tests each possible saturation value for validity. Masimo SET® signal processing can therefore identify the venous blood and other “noise”, isolate them and extract the arterial signal.
The performance of Masimo SET® pulse oximetry has been evaluated in more than 100 independent studies and thousands of clinical evaluations. We believe that Masimo SET® is trusted by clinicians to safely monitor in excess of approximately 200 million patients each year and has been chosen as the primary pulse oximeter technology used by nine of the top ten hospitals according to the 2022-2023 U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals Honor Roll. Compared to conventional pulse oximeters, during patient motion and low perfusion, Masimo SET® provides measurements when other pulse oximeters cannot, significantly reduces false alarms (improved specificity), and accurately detects true alarms (improved sensitivity). Despite pulse oximetry’s widespread use since the 1980s, it had not been shown to improve clinical outcomes before the introduction of Masimo SET®. Masimo SET® has been shown to help clinicians reduce severe retinopathy of prematurity neonates, improve CCHD screening in newborns, and, when used for continuous monitoring with Masimo Patient SafetyNet™ in post-surgical wards, reduce rapid response team activations, ICU transfers, and costs.
Our pulse oximetry technology is contained on a circuit board which can be placed inside a standalone pulse oximetry monitor, placed inside OEM multiparameter monitors, or included as part of an external “Board-in-Cable” solution that is plugged into a port on an OEM or other device. All of these solutions, as well as most of our patient cables, use our proprietary single-patient-use or reusable sensors . We sell our products to end-users through our direct sales force and through certain distributors, as well as to our OEM partners, for incorporation into their products. In 2013, with the launch of iSpO2®, we began selling our pulse oximetry products in the consumer home wellness market. 
To complement our Masimo SET® platform, we have developed a wide range of proprietary single-patient-use (disposable) sensors, including untethered Radius-PPG®, and multi-patient-use (reusable) sensors, cables and other accessories designed specifically to work with Masimo SET® software and hardware. Our single-patient-use sensors offer several advantages over reusable sensors, including improved performance, cleanliness, increased comfort and greater reliability. Although our technology platforms operate solely with our proprietary sensor lines, our sensors have the capability to work with certain competitive pulse oximetry monitors through the use of adapter cables.
Adhesive sensors are single-patient-use items, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows third parties to reprocess pulse oximetry sensors. In response to some hospitals’ requests to implement environmentally friendly products, we offer sensor reprocessing as well as sensor recycling programs. 
Masimo rainbow SET® Platform and Other Technology Solutions
Since introducing Masimo SET®, we have continued to innovate by introducing noninvasive measurements that go beyond arterial blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate. Our Masimo rainbow SET® platform leverages our Masimo SET® technology and incorporates licensed rainbow® technology to enable real-time monitoring of additional noninvasive measurements. Our rainbow SET® platform includes our rainbow SET® Pulse CO-Oximetry products, which we believe are the first devices cleared by the FDA to noninvasively and continuously monitor additional hemoglobin species that were previously only measurable using intermittent invasive procedures using multiple wavelengths of light.
In addition to SpO2, PR, perfusion index (Pi), Pleth Variability Index (PVi®), Rainbow® Pleth Variability Index (RPVi™) and respiration rate from the pleth (RRp®), rainbow® Pulse CO-Oximetry has the unique ability to measure and distinguish oxygenated hemoglobins from the dyshemoglobins that are incapable of transporting oxygen, carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO®) and methemoglobin (SpMet®). Besides the ability to measure SpCO® and SpMet®, the Masimo rainbow SET® platform also allows for the noninvasive and continuous monitoring of total hemoglobin concentration (SpHb®) as well as the monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation, in the presence of carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin, known as fractional arterial oxygen saturation (SpfO2™). Additionally, the rainbow SET® platform also allows for the calculation of Oxygen Content (SpOC) and Oxygen Reserve Index™ (ORi™). SpfO2™ and ORi™ have received CE Marking, but are not currently available for sale in the U.S.
We believe that Masimo rainbow® Pulse CO-Oximetry products will become widely adopted for the noninvasive monitoring of these measurements in the future. We also believe that the addition of acoustic respiration rate (RRa®), using our rainbow Acoustic Monitoring® technology, will strengthen the clinical demand for noninvasive and continuous monitoring using our rainbow® platform, especially in the growing general floor market.
Products with our MX circuit board contain our Masimo SET® pulse oximetry technology as well as circuitry to support rainbow® measurements. At the time of purchase, or at any time in the future, our customers and our OEMs’ customers have the option of purchasing additional rainbow® software measurements, which allow such customers to incrementally expand their patient monitoring systems with a cost-effective solution. To date, over forty companies have released rainbow SET® equipped products or announced rainbow® integration plans.
Following the introduction of our rainbow SET® platform, we have continued to expand our technology offerings by introducing additional noninvasive measurements, technologies, platforms and other solutions to create new market opportunities in both hospital and non-hospital care settings, including the Masimo Hospital Automation™ Platform, other connectivity platforms, nasal high-flow ventilation, and neuromodulation therapeutics and telehealth solutions, which are described in more detail below.
The Masimo Hospital Automation™ Platform
Patient SafetyNet™(1), our patient surveillance, remote monitoring and clinician notification solution, works in concert with our bedside and ambulatory monitoring devices to facilitate the supplemental monitoring of the oxygen saturation, pulse rate, perfusion index, hemoglobin, methemoglobin and respiration rate of up to 200 patients simultaneously from a single server. Patient SafetyNet™ offers an intuitive and powerful user interface with trending, real-time waveform capability at a central station, as well as remote clinician notification via pager, voice-over-IP phone or smart-phones. Patient SafetyNet™ also features an Adaptive Connectivity Engine™ (ACE™) that enables two-way, HL-7 based connectivity to clinical/hospital information systems. The ACE™ significantly reduces the time and complexity to integrate and validate custom HL-7 implementations, and demonstrates our commitment to innovation that automates patient care with open, scalable and standards-based connectivity architecture.
Patient SafetyNet™ Series 5000, along with Hospital Automation™ Connectivity, Iris Gateway®, Kite®, iSirona®, UniView®, UniView: 60 and MyView® through the Root® patient monitoring and connectivity platform, offers a new level of interoperability designed to enhance clinician workflows and reduce the cost of care in a variety of hospital settings, including operating rooms and the general care floors. Patient SafetyNet™ Series 5000 with Iris® ports enables Root® to assimilate data from all devices connected to the patient, thereby acting as a comprehensive in-room patient monitor and connectivity hub. Alarms and alerts for all devices are seamlessly forwarded to the patient’s clinician and device data can be transferred to the patient’s electronic medical record (EMR). In an operating room setting, the patient-centric user interface of the Patient SafetyNet™ Series 5000 displays near real-time data from all devices with Kite®, providing a single unified dashboard of patient information.
Connectivity Platforms
Despite medical technology advances, the lack of device communication and integration creates risks to patient safety in hospitals around the world. Without device interoperability, critical patient information can go unnoticed, leaving clinicians unaware and patients at risk. Existing approaches for device interoperability require separate hardware, software and/or network infrastructure, which can clutter the patient room, increase complexity, burden IT management and increase costs. To address these challenges, we introduced Iris® connectivity in our Root® patient monitoring and connectivity platform. iSirona and Iris® connectivity enables multiple standalone third-party devices such as intravenous pumps (IV), ventilators, hospital beds and other patient monitors to connect through Root®, enabling display, notification and documentation to the EMR through Masimo Patient SafetyNet™. 
The addition of Iris® connectivity to Root® and Patient SafetyNet™ provides multiple advantages to hospitals, such as allowing standalone device information to be remotely viewed at a Patient SafetyNet™ view station, transmitted through notification systems to clinicians regardless of location or sent to electronic health record systems. This may enhance patient assessment, clinical workflows and decision support. In addition, bringing data from disparate devices together facilitates more integrated patient care and provides a flexible and cost-effective platform, while avoiding installation of separate costly systems and potentially reducing costs by leveraging existing network infrastructure.

Nasal High-Flow Ventilation
The Masimo softFlow™ technology provides respiratory support by generating a precisely regulated, stable and high flow of room air or a mix of room air and oxygen through the nose of the patient by means of thin nasal prongs. Controlled oxygen supply ensures oxygenation while, at the same time, the respiratory airways are humidified. A stable air flow is essential for treating hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. Together with the Masimo softflow™ nasal applicator, the Masimo softflow™ generator provides a constant air flow and in doing so, it is completely independent of external pneumatic systems. Due to this, the Masimo softFlow™ technology is able to treat respiratory insufficiency and allows therapy at home in a manner that is as reliable and efficient as in the hospital. 
Neuromodulation Therapeutic
Bridge™ is the first FDA-cleared, drug-free, non-surgical device to use neuromodulation to aid in the reduction of symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal. Bridge™ can be used for patients experiencing opioid withdrawal symptoms, while undergoing treatment for opioid use disorder when initiating treatment, transitioning to naltrexone or tapering off medication-assisted treatment. In addition, we believe Bridge™ may reduce pain and addiction-related side-effects. Bridge™ is a small electrical nerve stimulator device that contains a battery-powered chip and wires that are applied percutaneously around a patient’s ear. It requires a prescription and is offered to qualified healthcare professionals with training. Bridge™ has been granted a FDA 510(k) de novo classification.
Telehealth Solutions
In an effort to help clinicians and public health officials combat the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed the Masimo SafetyNet™ solution. The Masimo SafetyNet™ solution provides continuous tetherless pulse oximetry and respiration rate monitoring coupled with a patient surveillance platform. Masimo SafetyNet™ solution is available worldwide. In partnership with Samsung Electronics America, Inc., the Masimo SafetyNet™ Patient App is available on select Samsung smartphones, pre-installed and pre-configured.

In addition, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws. Evolving interpretations of current laws or the adoption of new federal or state laws or regulations could adversely affect many of the arrangements we have with customers and physicians. Therefore, our risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that some of these laws are broad and open to interpretation. A summary of certain critical aspects of our regulatory environment is included below.
Product Clearance and Approval Requirements for Medical Devices
Many of our healthcare products are regulated by numerous government agencies, the most significant of which are the FDA, the national authorities in the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK), and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) of Japan. In addition, there are government agencies that regulate our healthcare products in other countries, whose requirements vary substantially from country to country. These agencies require us to comply with laws that regulate the design, development, clinical trials, testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, import, export and promotion of many of our products. 
In the U.S., unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we wish to market in the U.S. must, generally, first receive from the FDA either clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or approval of a premarket application (PMA). In some cases, the device may be authorized by the FDA through the de novo classification process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process requires us to show that our new medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed “predicate” medical device and usually takes from four to nine months, but it may take longer. The PMA process requires us to demonstrate through valid scientific evidence that there is reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. The PMA process is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the process of obtaining 510(k) clearance. Both 510(k) and PMA submissions are subject to user fees. The FDA determines the appropriate process based on the risk classification of the medical device. There are three classifications, from Class I to Class III. The majority of our current regulated products have been deemed Class II devices, requiring 510(k) clearance, while some have been deemed Class I devices.
Most of our OEM partners are required to obtain clearance or approval of their devices that incorporate Masimo’s healthcare technologies, like Masimo SET® technology, Masimo rainbow SET® technology, Masimo Board-in-Cable technology, or are used with Masimo’s sensors. We generally grant our OEM partners a right to cross-reference the 510(k) submission files from our cleared Masimo SET® circuit boards, sensors, cables and notification systems.
In the EU, medical devices are currently subject to Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (EU MDR). Under the EU MDR, a medical device may only be placed on the market within the EU if it conforms to certain “General Safety and Performance Requirements”. Key requirements include that a medical device achieves its intended performance and does not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients or the safety and health of users and others and bears the CE Mark. A medical device that conforms to such essential requirements can bear a CE Mark, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. Each medical device that we wish to market in the EU must conform to these requirements.
The UK exited the EU on December 31, 2020 (Brexit). The UK does not intend to implement the EU MDR into the laws of Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). Northern Ireland is an exception where the EU MDR will continue to apply. Great Britain instead introduced a new, standalone medical devices framework. Currently, this aligns closely to the EU MDD. Instead of a CE Mark, medical devices marketed in Great Britain must bear a UKCA Mark. However, EU CE Marks will continue to be recognized in Great Britain until June 30, 2023, as will certificates issued by EU-recognized notified bodies. This arrangement is not reciprocated in the EU. Each medical device that we wish to market in the UK must comply with the national laws in the UK, which going forward may differ from the laws in the EU.
Continuing FDA Regulation for Medical Devices
Clinical trials involving medical devices are subject to FDA regulation. Among other requirements, clinical trial sponsors must comply with requirements related to informed consent, Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, monitoring, reporting, record-keeping, labeling and promotion. If the study involves a significant risk device, the sponsor must obtain FDA approval of an investigational device exemption in addition to IRB approval prior to beginning the study. Information regarding certain device clinical trials must also be submitted to a public database maintained by the National Institutes of Health. 
After a device is approved and placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These regulatory requirements include, but are not limited to, the following: product listing and establishment registration; adherence to the Quality System Regulation (QSR) which requires stringent testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures for the design, manufacture, storage and handling of devices; labeling requirements and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of off-label uses or indications; adverse event and device malfunction reporting; post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval clinical trials or other required testing; post-market surveillance requirements; the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask for, or require, the recall of products from the market; and requirements relating to voluntary corrections or removals. Device manufacturers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to evaluate compliance with these requirements.
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, which are subject to new legislation and change, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, or other federal and state government agencies, which may include, but may not be limited to, any of the following sanctions or consequences: warning letters or untitled letters; fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall, seizure or import holds of our products; operating restrictions, suspension or shutdown of production; refusing to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new or modified products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted; and criminal prosecution.
Advertising and Promotion of Medical Devices
Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and by federal and state regulatory and enforcement authorities, including the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and various state attorneys general. Although physicians are permitted to use their medical judgment to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, we may not promote our products for such “off-label” uses and can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Other companies’ promotional activities for their FDA-regulated products have been the subject of FTC enforcement actions brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. FTC enforcement actions often result in consent decrees that constrain future actions. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. Government agencies in the EU, UK, Japan and other countries and jurisdictions have similar regulations on the advertising and promotion of medical devices.
Import and Export Requirements Applicable to Medical Devices
To import a device, the importer must file an entry notice and bond with the United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP). All devices are subject to FDA examination before release from CBP. Any article that appears to be in violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (FDCA) may be refused admission and a notice of detention and hearing may be issued. If the FDA ultimately refuses admission, the CBP may issue a notice for redelivery and, if a company fails to redeliver the goods or otherwise satisfy CBP and the FDA with respect to their disposition, may assess liquidated damages for up to three times the value of the lot. The CBP also imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products, including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance. 
Medical device products exported from the United States are subject to foreign countries’ import requirements and the exporting requirements of the FDA or European regulating bodies, as applicable. In particular, international sales of medical devices manufactured in the United States that are not approved or cleared by the FDA for use in the United States, or are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. 
Foreign countries often require, among other things, a Certificate of Foreign Government (CFG) for export. To obtain a CFG, the device manufacturer must apply to the FDA. The FDA certifies that the product has been granted clearance or approval in the United States and that the manufacturing facilities were in compliance with the FDA’s QSR regulations at the time of the last FDA inspection. Government agencies in the EU, UK, Japan and other countries and jurisdictions have similar regulations on the advertising and promotion of medical devices.
Anti-Kickback Regulations
In the U.S., there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or other health-related business. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any bribe, kickback or other remuneration intended to induce the referral of patients for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, health care products and services reimbursed by a federal health care program, including Medicare and Medicaid. Recognizing that the federal anti-kickback law is broad and potentially applicable to many commonplace arrangements, Congress and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) within the Department of Health and Human Services have created statutory “exceptions” and regulatory “safe harbors”. Exceptions and safe harbors exist for a number of arrangements relevant to our healthcare business, including, among other things, payments to bona fide employees, certain discount and rebate arrangements, and certain payment arrangements involving Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs).
Although an arrangement that fits into one or more of these exceptions or safe harbors is immune from prosecution, arrangements that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor do not necessarily violate the law, but the OIG or other government enforcement authorities may examine the practice to determine whether it involves the sorts of abuses that the statute was designed to combat. Violations of this federal law can result in significant penalties, including imprisonment, monetary fines and assessments, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. Exclusion of a manufacturer, like us, would preclude any federal health care program from paying for its products. 
In addition to the federal anti-kickback law, many states have their own laws that are analogous to the federal anti-kickback law, but may apply regardless of whether any federal or state health care program business is involved. Federal and state anti-kickback laws may affect our sales, marketing and promotional activities, educational programs, pricing and discount practices and policies, and relationships with health care providers by limiting the kinds of arrangements we may have with hospitals, alternate care market providers, GPOs, physicians, payers and others in a position to purchase or recommend our healthcare products.
False Claims Laws and Fraud Statutes
Federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. The Federal Civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly and willfully presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program, including Medicaid and Medicare. Some suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by a “whistleblower” or “relator” on behalf of the government and such individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Manufacturers, like us, can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government, where they are found to have caused submission of false claims by, among other things, providing incorrect coding or billing advice about their products to customers that file claims, or by engaging in kickback arrangements or off-label promotion with customers that file claims. A number of states also have false claims laws, and some of these laws may apply to claims for items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and/or commercial insurance. Sanctions under these federal and state fraud and abuse laws may include civil monetary penalties and criminal fines, exclusion from government health care programs and imprisonment.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created new federal crimes, including health care fraud and false statements related to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including those offered by private payers. The false statements statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. A violation of either statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment and other significant penalties.
Transparency Regulations
The Physician Payment Sunshine Act (Sunshine Act), which was enacted by Congress as part of the ACA, requires medical device companies to track and publicly report, with limited exceptions, all payments and transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals in the U.S. Companies are required to track payments made and to report such payments to the government by March 31 of each year. Several states have similar requirements. Beginning in 2022, the reporting requirement also applies to advance practice nurses and physician assistants. In addition to the burden of establishing processes for compliance, if we fail to provide these reports, or if the reports we provide are not accurate, we could be subject to significant penalties.
Anti-Corruption Statutes
Our international operations are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and other foreign anti-corruption laws. The FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. As part of our compliance program, we train our U.S. and international employees, and we also train and monitor foreign third parties with whom we contract (e.g., distributors), to comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws. Failing to comply with the FCPA or any other anti-corruption law could result in fines, penalties or other adverse consequences.
Third-Party Reimbursement for Medical Devices
Health care providers, including hospitals, that purchase our healthcare products generally rely on third-party payers, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private payers, including indemnity insurers and managed care plans, to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of the products and the procedures in which they are used. As a result, demand for our healthcare products is dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payers. No uniform coverage or reimbursement policy for medical technology exists among all third-party payers, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payer to payer. 
Because a large percentage of our healthcare products are used by Medicare beneficiaries, Medicare’s coverage and reimbursement policies are particularly significant to our healthcare business. Generally, Medicare will cover a medical product or procedure when the product or procedure is included within a statutory benefit category and is reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury, or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part. Even if the medical product or procedure is considered medically necessary and coverage is available, Medicare may place restrictions on the circumstances where it provides coverage. Because payments through the prospective payment system in both the hospital inpatient and outpatient settings are based on predetermined rates and may be less than a hospital’s actual costs in furnishing care, hospitals have incentives to lower their operating costs by utilizing products that will reduce the length of inpatient stays, decrease labor costs or otherwise lower their costs. If hospitals cannot obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products, or the procedures in which they are used, we cannot be certain that they will purchase our products, despite the clinical benefits and opportunity for cost savings that we believe can be derived from their use.
Our success with rainbow SET® technologies in the U.S. market in settings of care with reimbursable monitoring procedures, such as hospital emergency departments, hospital procedure labs and physician offices, may largely depend on the ability of providers to receive reimbursement for such procedures. While private insurance payers often follow Medicare coverage and payment, we cannot be certain of this and, in many cases, cannot control the coverage or payment rates that private insurance payers put in place. 
Our success in non-U.S. markets depends largely upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from the third-party payers through which health care providers are paid in those markets. Health care payment systems in non-U.S. markets vary significantly by country, and include single-payer government managed systems, as well as systems in which private payers and government managed systems exist side-by-side. Our ability to achieve market acceptance or significant sales volume in international markets we enter will be dependent in large part on the availability of reimbursement for procedures performed using our products under health care payment systems in such markets. 
Other U.S. and Foreign Regulation
We must comply with numerous federal, state and local laws, as well as laws in other jurisdictions, relating to matters such as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and hazardous substance disposal. We cannot be sure that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future or that these laws or regulations will not hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new requirements could hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Data Privacy and Protection of Health and Other Personal Information 
Both at the federal and state levels, the United States has increased legislative activity in connection with data privacy and data security. In addition to the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) which went into effect on January 1, 2023, a number of other states have passed comprehensive consumer privacy laws or have introduced related bills. On the federal level, an omnibus privacy bill (the American Data Privacy and Protection Act) was proposed and is currently under congressional review. If enacted, the law will dramatically increase oversight of how companies collect, use, and store the personal data. Federal agencies such as the FTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have increased their scrutiny and enforcement of how companies disclose their use of personal data to consumers, secure personal data, and report unauthorized disclosures of personal data. In particular, the FTC has issued statements that indicate increase in enforcement action against deceptive marketing practices that use cookies, pixels and other tracking tags to monitor consumer behavior. Moreover, there has been a similar increase in privacy-related class action litigation in connection with the use of consumers’ personal data.
Internationally, in addition to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, other jurisdictions have adopted their own data privacy and protection laws. China, Canada, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the UAE have passed new privacy and data protection laws. Australia, Argentina and India are expected to introduce new privacy laws in 2023. We have implemented, and continue to implement, procedures and processes to comply with these various laws and regulations. As international data privacy and protection laws continue to evolve, and as new regulations, interpretive guidance and enforcement information become available, we may incur incremental costs to modify our business practices to comply with these requirements. In addition, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by third-parties, nation states, our employees or agents.
Recently, we have seen a global rise in scrutiny and legislative activity in connection with data breaches of health information in medical devices. Data security related to medical devices has been a priority for us and will continue to be so as we strive to safeguard the health information of our device users and of our customers’ patients. We may be required to make costly system and device modifications to comply with privacy and security requirements. Our failure to comply may result in liability and adversely affect our business.
Additionally, in the U.S,. the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) applies to covered entities and extends to their business associates. Covered entities include many healthcare facilities that purchase and use our products. The HIPAA Privacy Rule restricts the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) and requires covered entities and their business associates to safeguard that information. The HIPAA Security Rule establishes detailed technical, administrative and physical requirements for safeguarding PHI transmitted or stored electronically. Although we are not a covered entity, we are sometimes deemed by our U.S. customers to be a business associate due to activities that we perform for or on behalf of covered entity customers. As business associates, we may be subject to many of the requirements of HIPAA and could be directly subject to HIPAA civil and criminal enforcement and the associated penalties for violation of the Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Rules. Moreover, even when we are not a business associate, healthcare facilities impose contractual limitations on the use and disclosure of their patients’ health information, and otherwise require additional safeguards to protect that information. These laws, as well as any new developing laws around health data, could create liability for us and increase our cost of doing business as well as increase costs associated with complying with these various laws both in the U.S. and globally. 
Environmental Regulations
We are subject to stringent international, federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the use, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Products that we sell in Europe are subject to regulation in EU markets under the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS). RoHS prohibits companies from selling products that contain certain hazardous materials in EU member states. Other regulations which affect the product content, manufacturing, and packaging of our products include, for example, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances, the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, and the Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste enacted in the EU which require the registration of and regulate the use of certain hazardous substances and chemicals in certain products we manufacture, and require the collection, reuse and recycling of waste product and packaging from, certain products we manufacture. Similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in Japan, China, other foreign countries and various states of the U.S. may require us to re-design our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types of materials or adding country specific product and/or packaging labeling. Any redesigns or alternative materials may detrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions, result in additional costs or have other similar negative effects.
Future environmental laws may require us to alter our manufacturing processes, thereby increasing our manufacturing costs. We believe that our products and manufacturing processes at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws; however, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated.
Markets
Competitive Conditions
We compete in both healthcare and consumer electronic markets throughout the globe. These markets are highly competitive and are characterized by continual change and improvements in technology. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, broader product portfolios and more aggressive advertising and marketing strategies and may be able to adapt to market preferences or consumer demands more rapidly than us. Competitors may develop superior products or products of similar quality for sale at the same or lower prices. Moreover, our products could be rendered obsolete by changes to industry standards or guidelines or advances in technology.
Our primary competitor in the healthcare market is Medtronic plc, who currently holds a substantial share of the pulse oximetry market. In addition, large technology companies that have not historically operated in the healthcare or medical device space, such as Alphabet Inc. (Alphabet), Amazon, Apple Inc. (Apple), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung) and others, have developed or may develop products and technologies that may compete with our current or future products and technologies in the consumer health and professional healthcare marketplaces. 
In the non-healthcare market, we compete with Sonos, Bang & Olufsen, Sony, Samsung (and its subsidiaries), Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and others. Many of our competitors in the non-healthcare market have more broadly diversified product lines, well established supply and distribution systems, loyal customer bases and significant financial, marketing, research, development and other resources.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate include:
•brand recognition, perception of innovation abilities, and reputation;
•product technology and innovation;
•product quality and safety; 
•quality, cost-effectiveness and price;
•breadth of product lines, network of technology and content partners;
•access to hospitals which are members of GPO and OEM partners;
•access to integrated delivery networks, third party retailers, sales channels, e-commerce, distributors, retailers and omni-channel retailers; and
•patent protection.
Market Demand 
We currently sell our healthcare products directly to hospitals and various distributors in the U.S. and around the world, including Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific, through our direct sales force. We sell our home wellness products through e-commerce internet sites such as www.masimopersonalhealth.com, www.amazon.com and www.shopify.com.
Our sales and marketing strategy for pulse oximetry has been, and will continue to be, focused on building end-user awareness of the clinical and cost-saving benefits of our technologies. Our healthcare sales representatives’ primary focus is to facilitate the conversion of competitor accounts to our Masimo SET® pulse oximetry and rainbow SET® Pulse CO-Oximetry products, to expand the use of Masimo SET® and Patient SafetyNet™ on the general hospital floor and to create and expand the use of rainbow® measurements in both critical care and non-critical care areas. In addition to sales representatives, we employ clinical specialists to work with our sales representatives to educate end-users on the benefits of Masimo SET® and assist with the introduction and implementation of our technology and products to their sites.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, one just-in-time healthcare distributor represented approximately 10.1% of our total healthcare revenue. This was the only customer that represented 10% or more of our healthcare revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Importantly, this distributor takes and fulfills orders from our direct healthcare customers, many of which have signed long-term sensor purchase agreements with us. If a specific just-in-time healthcare distributor is unable to fulfill these orders, the orders would be redirected to other healthcare distributors or fulfilled directly by us.
Additionally, we sell certain of our healthcare products through our OEM partners who incorporate our technologies into their monitors and sometimes resell our sensors to their installed base. Our OEM agreements allow us to expand the availability of our technologies through the sales and distribution channels of each OEM partner. To facilitate clinician awareness of Masimo technologies, our OEM partners have generally agreed to place the applicable Masimo trademark prominently on their instruments.
In order to facilitate our U.S. direct sales to hospitals, we have signed contracts with what we believe to be the five largest national GPOs in the U.S., based on the total volume of negotiated purchases. In return for the GPOs putting our healthcare products on contract, we have agreed to pay the GPOs a percentage of our healthcare revenue from their member hospitals. In 2022 and 2021, healthcare revenues from the sale of our pulse oximetry products to hospitals that are associated with GPOs amounted to $721.3 million and $643.1 million, respectively.
We sell our non-healthcare products primarily through over 20,000 points of global retail distribution and our products are distributed in more than 130 countries. The majority of our non-healthcare sales are transacted through traditional physical retailers, third party distributors and big box resellers, including on their websites. We also sell through online retailers and custom installers and directly through our individual brand websites.
Our non-healthcare marketing strategy is designed to build brand awareness, acquire new customers, enhance customer loyalty and drive in-store and online transactions with sustainable, profitable growth. Our non-healthcare marketing investments are focused on driving profitability growth through targeted advertising, public relations and brand promotion activities, including digital platforms, sponsorships, collaborations, brand activations, channel marketing and strategic partnerships. We continue to invest significant resources in our marketing and brand development efforts, including investing in capital expenditures on product displays to support our channel marketing through our retail partners.
Seasonality
Our quarterly revenues are influenced by many factors, including new product releases, acquisitions, regulatory approvals, patient holiday schedules, hospital census, the timing of influenza season, and other factors. Our healthcare revenues in the third quarter of our fiscal years have generally historically represented a lower percentage of segment revenues due to the seasonality of the U.S., European and Japanese markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures utilizing our healthcare products. Our non-healthcare revenues in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year generally produce a higher percentage of our segment revenues than the other quarters of our fiscal year due to the holiday shopping season and our corresponding promotional activities. 
Resources
Intellectual Property
We believe that in order to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology. The ownership of intellectual property rights is an important factor in our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, continuing technological innovations, licensing opportunities, internet domain names and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries.
We have developed a diverse intellectual property portfolio internally, and through acquisitions and licensing, that covers many aspects of our product offerings. In aggregate, our intellectual property is of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single intellectual property asset or license is material on its own to either segment of our business or to our business as a whole.
Under the Cross-Licensing Agreement, we and Cercacor have agreed to allocate proprietary ownership of technology developed based on the functionality of the technology. We will have proprietary ownership, including ownership of all patents, copyrights and trade secrets, of all technology related to the noninvasive monitoring of vital signs measurements, and Cercacor will have proprietary ownership of all technology related to the noninvasive monitoring of non-vital signs measurements. 
We have been issued hundreds of patents and trademarks and currently have hundreds of pending patent and trademark applications in the U.S. and abroad and continue to file for additional patent and trademark protection where appropriate and cost effective. We intend to hold these patents and trademarks as part of our strategy to protect and defend our technology and branding, including to protect and defend our company in patent‑related and trademark-related litigation. We believe that our intellectual property has significant value and is important to our brand‑building efforts and the marketing of our products and services. We cannot predict, however, whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of any of these rights. 
Some of our competitors may seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and low-cost structures while infringing on our intellectual property. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected products less valuable if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity, misappropriation, or other claims. There is no guarantee that we will prevail on our litigation claims against third parties and any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. Moreover, any settlement of or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the technology that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. Any required licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we attempt to design around the technology at issue or to find another provider of suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering applicable software or product solutions, our continued supply of software or product solutions could be disrupted or our introduction of new or enhanced software or products could be significantly delayed.
We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, in part, with confidentiality agreements with consultants, vendors and employees, although we cannot be certain that the agreements will not be breached or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach.
There are risks related to our intellectual property rights. For further detail on these risks, see “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” under Item 1A—“Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Research and Product Development
We believe that ongoing research and development (R&D) efforts are essential to our success. Our R&D efforts focus on continuing to enhance our technical expertise toward our existing product portfolios, expanding our technological leadership in each of the markets we serve with new innovations, entering into strategic partnerships with third parties to fund the development of certain new technologies, driving growth in emerging markets and introducing new products necessary to maintain market superiority, while reducing the cost of care. In addition, we continue to collaborate with Cercacor on R&D activities related to advancing rainbow® technology and other technologies. 
Manufacturing
Our strategy is to manufacture products in-house when it is efficient and cost-effective for us to do so. We manufacture products at facilities located in various countries throughout the world and maintain captive contract maquiladora operations for key healthcare components. We will continue to utilize third-party contract manufacturers for products and subassemblies that can be more efficiently manufactured by these parties, such as our circuit boards, speakers and certain audio components. We monitor our third-party manufacturers and perform inspections and product tests at various steps in the manufacturing cycle to ensure compliance with our specifications. We also do full functional testing of our circuit boards. 
For raw materials, we and our contract manufacturers may rely on sole source suppliers for some components, including digital signal processor chips and analog-to-digital converter chips. We and our contract manufacturers have taken steps to minimize the impact of a shortage or stoppage of shipments of digital signal processor chips or analog to digital converter chips, including maintaining a safety stock of inventory and designing software that may be easily ported to another digital signal processor chip. Generally, we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components. However, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials if we experience a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply and are unable to develop alternative sources. 
We have agreements with certain major suppliers and each agreement provides for varying terms with respect to contract expiration, termination and pricing. Most of these agreements allow for termination upon specified advance notice of various periods to the non-terminating party. Certain of these agreements with our major suppliers allow for pricing adjustments and each agreement provides for annual pricing negotiation.
For additional information related to our manufacturing facilities, refer to “Item 2. Properties” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Sustainability
As a global manufacturer of technology products, we understand the materials we use and the products we manufacture can have an impact on the environment. We are continuously evaluating ways to reduce our overall environmental footprint. We have implemented measures to promote greater environmental responsibility, conserve resources and reduce waste in an effort to help combat climate change.
We are committed to operating in an environmentally responsible manner and support the internationally recognized environmental principles set forth in the United Nations Global Compact. We strive to identify new opportunities to improve the sustainability of our business and encourage our employees to join in our efforts. In furtherance of these commitments, we reinforce the following sustainability principles:
•Environmental. We undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility and incorporate energy efficiency measures in all areas of our business. We comply with applicable environmental protection laws in all areas of our business.
•Social. We train and encourage our employees to conduct their activities in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner.
•Economic. We continuously take steps to minimize material waste and energy inefficiencies in our products and manufacturing processes.

Human Capital Resources
Core to our long-term strategy for human capital is attracting, developing and retaining the best talent globally with the right skills to drive our future success. We consider our employees to be our greatest assets and the greatest strength behind our innovation and success. We seek to attract and retain highly talented, experienced and well-educated individuals to support our long-term growth and profitability goals. 
Our success and future growth is largely dependent on our ability to attract, retain and develop a diverse workforce at all levels of the organization. To succeed, we have developed key recruitment and retention strategies that we focus on as part of our overall management of our business. These include:
•Compensation. Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with their performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract and retain employees while motivating them to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balance incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. 
▪Our executive compensation is aligned with stockholder interests by aligning pay-for-performance metrics.
▪We utilize nationally-recognized compensation consultants to evaluate our executive compensation benefit programs and provide benchmarking against our peer groups.
▪We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, experience, skills, knowledge and geography.
▪Our annual increases and cash incentives are based on market and awarded based on merit.
▪We offer a wide variety of benefits, including health insurance, paid time off, retirement plans, and voluntary benefits such as financial and personal wellness benefits, etc.
•Health and Safety. We are committed to the safety and well-being of our employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes to our business in an effort to protect our employees and customers. We instituted safety protocols and procedures for our employees who work on site, including: installation of plexiglass partitions between work stations at our primary manufacturing and assembly facilities, increased distancing and implementation of extensive cleaning and sanitation procedures for our manufacturing and assembly facilities and our general administration and sales facilities.
•Developing Leaders of Tomorrow/Succession Planning. We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our next generation of leaders. Our executive management team conducts organization and leadership reviews of all business leaders, focusing on our high-performing and high potential talent, diversity, and the succession planning for critical roles.

In addition, for 2021 and 2022, we were recognized on Fortune Best Workplaces in Manufacturing & Production™.

Cybersecurity
We regularly perform risk assessments relating to cybersecurity risks. We have a risk-based cybersecurity program, dedicated to protecting our data and data that may be collected from patient monitoring devices. We utilize a defense-in-depth strategy with multiple layers of security controls to protect our data and systems. We mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing extensive measures, including employee training, systems monitoring and testing and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans. We continually evaluate ourselves for appropriate business continuity and disaster recovery planning, with test scenarios that include simulations and penetration tests. We also install and regularly update antivirus software on all of our Company-managed systems to detect malicious code and prevent it from impacting our systems. We require cybersecurity awareness training for all staff members with access to our network. We also maintain cyber liability insurance coverage to further reduce our risk profile. Security of our financial data and other sensitive information remains a high priority for us, led by our global information security team. We employ an appropriate encryption and tokenization platform for all online and direct-to-consumer sales from our websites, ensuring no credit card data is stored in our internal systems.
